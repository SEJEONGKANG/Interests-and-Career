**** Chapter 61 ****
In spite of the persuasion of Pang Tong and Fa Zheng, Liu Bei steadily refused
to sanction the assassination of his host at the banquet, Imperial Protector
Liu Zhang, even if thereby he was to gain possession of West River Land.
The next day there was another banquet, this time in the city of Fucheng,
whereat host and guest unbosomed themselves freely to each other and became
exceedingly friendly and affectionate.
All were mellow with wine, and Pang Tong, talking with Fa Zheng, said, âSince
our master will have nothing to do with our scheme, we had better set Wei
Yanâs sword-play to work and take advantage of the confusion to kill Liu
Zhang.â
Wei Yan came in shortly afterward, with his sword drawn, and said, âThere
being no other entertainment at this banquet, may I show you a little fencing
to amuse you?â
Thereupon Pang Tong called up some of the armed guards and ranged them along
the lower part of the hall till Wei Yan should fall on.
At these preparations the officers of Liu Zhang stared with questioning eyes
toward the chief seats at the upper end.
Then one of them, Zhang Ren, drew his sword, saying, âAn opponent is needed
to make fencing a success, so he and I will display our skill at the same
time.â
So they began. Presently, at a glance from Wei Yan, Liu Feng came up and took
position at his side.
At once three of the commanders of the west followed suit, saying, âAnd we
three will come in too. It may add to your amusement and help to raise a
laugh.â
But to Liu Bei matters began to take on a serious look. Drawing a sword of a
servant, he stood out in the banquet hall and cried, âWe brothers have
perhaps honored our meeting with a little too much wine. There is nothing to
say against that, but this is no Hongmen Banquet, where murder was done. Put up
your swords, or I will slay you!â
âWhy wear swords at all at a meeting of two brothers?â cried Liu Zhang, at
the same time telling his servants to surround his officers and take away their
weapons.
Disarmed, they sulkily withdrew.
Then Liu Bei called all the generals of Liu Zhang to the upper end of the
banquet hall, gave them wine, and said, âYou need have no doubts. We two
brothers, of the same bone and blood, have talked over the great design, and we
are one in purpose.â
The officers bowed and retired.
Liu Zhang took his guest by the hand, saying, âBrother, I shall never forget
your kindness.â
They sat drinking till late, both feeling very happy. When at length Liu Bei
reached his camp, he blamed his strategist for having caused the confusion.
âWhy did you endeavor to force me into committing a great wrong?â said Liu
Bei. âThere must be no repetition of this.â
Pang Tong retired, sighing.
When Liu Zhang reached his own camp, his leaders waited on him and said,
âSir, you saw the real meaning of that occurrence at the banquet, we suppose.
We think it prudent for you to retire at once into the city.â
âMy brother is different from ordinary humans,â replied Liu Zhang.
âHe may not incline toward murder himself, but those about him have but one
desire â-that is to exploit this land of ours to their own advantage.â
âDo not try to sow dissension between us and make us quarrel,â said their
chief.
And Liu Zhang took no heed of their remonstrance. One day, when he and Liu Bei
were enjoying together relaxation from cares of state, the news came that Zhang
Lu was about to invade the West River Land at the Jiameng Pass. Thereupon the
Imperial Protector begged Liu Bei to go and defend it. Liu Bei consented and
left immediately with his own especial band.
At once Liu Zhangâs officers took advantage of the guestâs departure to
urge the Imperial Protector to place his own trusty generals in command at
various strategic points, so as to guard against any attempts of the visitors
to seize the land. At first Liu Zhang was unwilling and refused, but as they
prayed him most earnestly to do this he yielded and consented to take some
steps to safeguard himself. He sent Yang Huai, Commander of Baishui, and Gao
Pei to garrison River Fu Pass.
So Liu Zhang returned to Chengdu and his guest, Liu Bei, went away to the point
where invasion threatened. Arrived there, Liu Bei soon won the hearts of the
people by the strict discipline he maintained over his army and by his gracious
manner.
News of these doings in the west duly reached the south, and Sun Quan summoned
his counselors as to his countermove.
Then Gu Yong spoke, saying, âI have an infallible plan to propose. Liu Bei
and his army are now far away and separated from us by difficult country.
Therefore he cannot return quickly, and my advice is to occupy the passes so
that he cannot get through. Then send all your force against Jingzhou and
Xiangyang, and they will surely fall to you.â
âThe plan seems excellent,â said Sun Quan.
But just then a voice was heard from behind the screen, crying, âYou may just
put to death the man who proposed that scheme for trying to compass the death
of my daughter.â
Everyone started with surprise. It was the Dowager Marchionessâ voice.
Further, Lady Wu looked very angry as she entered, saying, âWhat is to become
of my only daughter, who is the wife of Liu Bei?â
She turned her wrathful eyes to Sun Quan and said, âYou were heir to your
father and brother and obtained possession of all these lands without the least
effort. Yet you are dissatisfied and would forget the claims of your own flesh
and blood and sacrifice your sister for the sake of adding a little to your
lands.â
âNo, no!â murmured Sun Quan, ashamed. âI would never think of going
contrary to my motherâs wishes and orders.â
He abruptly dismissed the assembly, and when they had gone the old lady, still
nursing her wrath, retired to her own apartments.
Left alone beneath the portico, Sun Quan sighed sadly.
âThis chance missed! When will Jingzhou be mine?â thought he.
While still deep in reverie, Zhang Zhao came up, saying, âWhat grieves my
lord?â
âNo great matter; only this last failure to gain my ends.â
âThe difficulty may be easily removed,â said Zhang Zhao. âChoose some
trusty man and charge him with a secret letter to Lady Sun Ren saying that her
mother is dangerously ill. Give him five hundred men as escort and tell him to
make his way privily into Jingzhou City and deliver the letter. Hearing her
mother wants her, she will rush home at once, and she might bring with her the
only son of Liu Bei. Liu Bei will be glad enough to exchange Jingzhou for his
son. If he will not, you can still send the army.â
âThat sounds like a good plan,â said Sun Quan. âFurther, I have the man
to carry it out successfully. He is that Zhou Shan, who was a bold one. He used
to accompany my brother in his youth. He is the man to go.â
âKeep it a secret, then,â said Zhang Zhao, âand let Zhou Shan start
quickly.â
It was decided that Zhou Shan should take with him about five hundred soldiers
disguised as ordinary traders. He had five vessels and distributed his men
among them, while weapons were hidden in the holds. Travel documents were
forged to look like veritable authority in case they were asked.
Zhou Shan set out along the river route for the city of Jingzhou and was not
long on the way. He anchored his ships under the bank, landed, and went into
the city to the residence, where he bade the doorkeepers announce him. He was
admitted and led into the presence of Lady Sun and presently gave her the
secret letter. When she read that her mother was in danger of death, she began
to weep bitterly and questioned the messenger closely.
Zhou Shan invented a story, saying, âThe Dowager Marchioness is really
fretting for a sight of yours. If you do not go quickly, it will be too late.
The Dowager Marchioness also wants to see little Liu Shan once before she
dies.â
Lady Sun replied, âYou know that the Imperial Uncle is far away on military
service, and I ought to inform the chief of the army before returning home.â
âBut what will you do if the chief says he must inform your husband and await
his consent?â said Zhou Shan.
âIf I went without asking permission â-but I fear that is impossible.â
âMy ships are all ready in the river, and you have only to drive through the
city,â said Zhou Shan.
Naturally the news of her motherâs illness greatly disturbed the young wife.
In a short time her carriage was ready, and she mounted, taking Liu Shan with
her. She took an escort of thirty guards, all armed, and was soon at the river
side and had embarked before the palace people could report what she was doing.
But just as the ships were starting, a voice was heard, shouting, âDo not
start yet! Let me bid my lady farewell.â
The voice was Zhao Zilongâs . He had just returned from an inspection trip,
and they had at once told him of Lady Sunâs sudden departure. As soon as he
had recovered from his surprise, he dashed down to the river bank like a
whirlwind, with only half a dozen followers. He arrived only just in time. The
boat was starting, and Zhou Shan stood in the prow, a long spear in his hand.
âWho are you that you dare hinder the movements of your mistress?â cried
Zhou Shan.
Zhou Shan bade his soldiers cast off and get under way, and also to prepare
their weapons to fight. The ship moved off with a fair wind and a strong
current beneath her keel.
But Zhao Zilong followed along the bank.
âMy lady may go or not as she pleases,â cried he, âbut I have one word to
say to her.â
Zhou Shan turned a deaf ear and only urged his soldiers to get greater speed on
the ship. Zhao Zilong followed down the bank for some three or more miles. Then
he saw a fishing boat made fast to the bank. He at once dismounted, cast off
the rope, took his spear, and leaped into the boat. Then he made the two men
row him toward the vessel in which sat Lady Sun.
As he approached, the soldiers of the South Land threatened him with their
spears. Thereupon he threw his spear into the bottom of the boat, drew the
glittering steel blade he wore, dashed aside the opposing spears, and leaped
upon the larger vessel. The guards of the South Land fell back in surprise and
fear, and Zhao Zilong went down into the body of the ship. There sat Lady Sun
with little Liu Shan in her arms.
âWhy this rude intrusion?â said she angrily.
The warrior sheathed his sword and said humbly, âWhither may my mistress be
going, and why goes she privily?â
âMy mother is ill and on the point of death. I had no time to inform any
person of my departure,â said Lady Sun.
âBut why take the young master if you are going merely to see a sick
person?â said Zhao Zilong.
âLiu Shan is my son, and I would not leave him behind to be neglected.â
âMistress, you have acted wrongly. My lord has but this one son of his body,
and I rescued the child lord from among many thousand troops of Cao Cao in the
great battle at Long Slope Bridge in Dangyang. There is no reason for you to
take him away.â
Lady Sun took refuge in anger. âYou leave my family affairs alone, you common
soldier!â cried she.
âMy lady, if you will go, then go, but leave the young master behind.â
âYou are a rebel, jumping on board the ship like that!â cried Lady Sun.
âIf you will not leave the young lord behind, I refuse to let you go, come
what may,â said Zhao Zilong.
Lady Sun called in her maids to seize him, but he just pushed them off. Then he
took the boy from her arms and ran out to the prow of the ship. He tried to get
the vessel in to the bank, but no one would aid him, and he thought it would be
wrong to begin to slay indiscriminately. He knew not what to do in such a
quandary. And Lady Sun was screaming to her maids to take the boy away from
him. But he kept too firm a grip on the child, and the good sword in his other
hand kept everyone at bay.
Zhou Shan was at the helm, giving all his attention to getting the ship out
into the current and away down the river. He steered for the middle of the
stream, where the wind was strong. Zhao Zilong, one hand taken up with holding
the boy, was quite unable to get the vessel in toward the shore.
Just as things looked most desperate, Zhao Zilong saw a string of ships filing
out from a creek lower down the stream, flags fluttering and drums beating. He
thought that certainly all was over and he was about to fall a victim to a
stratagem of the South Land, when he noticed a mighty warrior standing in the
prow of the leading craft. He was armed with a long spear, and it was Zhang
Fei.
Zhang Fei also shouted, âSister-in-law! Leave the child lord.â
Zhang Fei had been out scouting when he heard the news of his sister-in-lawâs
sudden departure, and he at once made for the River Yu with the intention of
intercepting her flight. He had arrived just in the nick of time to cut off the
ships of the South Land. Very soon, sword in hand, he had boarded the vessel.
As Zhang Fei came on board, Zhou Shan drew his sword and advanced toward him,
but one sweep of Zhang Feiâs blade laid him on the deck dead. And the grim
warrior hung his head at the feet of Lady Sun.
âWhy this very unseemly behavior?â cried Lady Sun, now quite frightened.
âSister,â said Zhang Fei, âyou thought very little of my brother when you
set out on this mad journey. That was behaving rudely.â
âMy mother is very ill. It is a matter of life and death,â cried she. âIf
I had waited for your brotherâs permission to go, I should have been too
late. If you do not let me go now, I will throw myself into the river.â
Zhao Zilong and Zhang Fei took counsel together. They said to each other, âIt
is hardly the correct thing for servants to force their lordâs wife into
committing suicide. Suppose we keep the child and let the vessel go.â
Then they said, âO Lady, we cannot allow the wife of our exalted brother to
die a death of shame, and so we will take our leave. We trust you will not
forget our brother and that you will return quickly.â
Taking the child with them, they left the vessel, and the five ships of the
South Land continued their voyage down stream. One poet has praised the conduct
of Zhao Zilong:
Before, Zhao Zilong saved Liu Shan,
What time his mother died;
Again like service he performs,
Upon the Great Riverâs tide.
The soldiers of Wu all in the ship,
Were stricken down with fear
Search all the world, you never find
Of bold Zhao Zilong the peer.
Another has eulogized Zhang Fei:
At Long Slope Bridge,
With rage Zhang Fei boiled,
Like wild beast roared,
And warriors recoiled.
From danger now
His prince is saved.
On historyâs page
His name is graved.
Quite satisfied with their success, the two warriors sailed homeward. Before
they had gone far, they met Zhuge Liang with a squadron of ships. He was very
pleased to find they had recovered the child, and they three joyfully returned
to Jingzhou, whence an account of the whole adventure was written to Liu Bei.
When Lady Sun reached her home, she related the story of the death of Zhou Shan
and the carrying off of the child. Naturally Sun Quan was very wrath at the
miscarriage of his scheme, and he resolved to attack Jingzhou in revenge for
his messengerâs murder.
âNow that my sister has returned home, there is no longer any family tie to
prevent the attack, and I will take full measure of revenge for the death of my
general,â said Sun Quan.
So he called the council to consider the expedition.
But before they could decide upon any plan, their deliberations were suddenly
cut short by the news that Cao Cao was coming down upon the South Land with
four hundred thousand troops, burning to avenge his defeat at the Red Cliffs.
All thoughts now turned toward repelling his attack.
Adviser Zhang Hong, who had retired to his home ill, had just died, and his
testament was sent to his lord to read. Therein he advised Sun Quan:
âMy lord, the seat of government should be removed to the old land of Moling,
where the scenery seems to bear the impress of kingly dignity, befitting a
person who cherishes the ambition of founding an enduring dynasty.â
Sun Quan read this document out to his councilors at this meeting, not without
many tears in memory of the writer.
He told them, saying, âZhang Hong was sincere till his death. I cannot
withstand his last advice!â
And Sun Quan at once gave orders to build a walled city named Shidou in Moling,
and changed the name of the land to Jianye. Henceforth he intended to make his
capital there.
As a protection against Cao Cao, Admiral Lu Meng proposed building a rampart at
River Ruxu.
Some other officers opposed this, saying, âWhen the enemy appears, you will
have to land in order to attack him, and after that you will return to your
ships. What is the use of a rampart?â
Lu Meng replied, âOne must prepare against possibilities. Soldiers vary in
keenness and sometimes lose battles. If an urgent occasion arises, the soldiers
may be unable to reach the waterâs edge, and how then are they to embark?
They will then need shelter.â
Sun Quan said, âProvision against eventualities, such as he proposes, is
good. Against a distant risk provide, and sorrow walks not by your side.â
So they sent soldiers to build ramparts at River Ruxu, and as the work ceased
not day or night the wall was soon completed.
In the capital Cao Caoâs influence and glory waxed daily greater. High
Counselor Dong Zhao proposed that the title of duke should be conferred upon
him.
Dong Zhao said, âIn all history, no one has rendered such services as you
have, O Prime Minister, not even Duke of Zhou or Lu Wang. These thirty years
you have exposed yourself to all risks, been combed by the wind and bathed by
the rain, and you have swept evil from the empire, succored the distressed, and
restored the Hans. Who of all statesmen can rank with you? It would be fitting
for you to become the Duke of Wei and receive the Nine Dignities, that your
merit and virtue be known to all.â
Now the Nine Dignities, or signs of honor, were:
1. Chariots: Gilded chariots drawn by eight horses
2. Court dresses: Dragon-embroidered robes, headdresses, and shoes
3. Music at banquets: By royal bands
4. Red doors: Symbols of wealth
5. Inner staircase: Protection for every step
6. Imperial Tiger Guard: Three hundred at the gates
7. Imperial axes: Commanding and ceremonial symbols
8. Bow and arrows: Red-lacquered bow with a hundred arrows
9. Libation vessels: Jade tablets and libation cups
However, all the courtiers were not of one mind.
Said High Adviser Xun Yu, âThis should not be done, O Prime Minister. You
raised a force by an appeal to the innate sense of righteousness of the people,
and with that force you restored the Han authority. Now you should remain loyal
and humble. The virtuous person loves people with a virtuous love and would not
act in this way.â
Cao Cao did not take this opposition kindly.
Dong Zhao said, âHow can we disappoint the hopes of many because of the words
of one?â
So a memorial went to the Throne, and Cao Caoâs ambitions and desires were
gratified with the title of Duke of Wei. The Nine Dignities were added.
âI did not think to see this day!â said Xun Yu, sighing.
This remark was repeated to the newly created Duke and angered him. He took it
to mean that Xun Yu would no longer aid him or favor his designs.
In the winter of the seventeenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 212), Cao Cao
decided to send an army to conquer the South Land, and he ordered Xun Yu to go
with it. Xun Yu understood from this that Cao Cao wished his death, so he
declined the appointment on the plea of illness. While Xun Yu was at home, he
received one day a box such as one sent with presents of dainties. It was
addressed in Cao Caoâs own handwriting. Opening it, Xun Yu found therein
nothing. He understood; so he took poison and died. He was fifty-two years of
age.
Xun Yuâs talents were to all people known,
That was sad that at the door of power he tripped.
Posterity is wrong to class him with the noble Zhang Liang,
For, nearing death, he dared not face his lord of Han.
News of Xun Yuâs death came to Cao Cao in the form of the ordinary letter of
mourning by his son, Xun Yun. Then Cao Cao was sorry and gave orders for an
imposing funeral. He also obtained for the dead man the posthumous title of
lordship.
The northern army reached River Ruxu, whence Cao Cao sent a reconnaissance of
thirty thousand troops led by Cao Hong down to the river.
Soon Cao Hong reported: âThe enemyâs fleet blankets the river, but no sign
of movements.â
Feeling suspicious, Cao Cao led his army to the river to watch the enemy and
deploy his troops. On the river he saw displayed a fleet of ships all arranged
in admirable order, the divisions being marked by distinctive flags. The
equipment glittered in the sunlight. In the center was a large ship whereon was
a huge umbrella, and beneath the shade sat Sun Quan in the midst of his staff.
âThat is the sort of son to have,â said Cao Cao in admiration, ânot such
piglets and puppies as Liu Biaoâs .â
Suddenly, at the explosion of a bomb, the ships got under way and came flying
toward him, while a force moved out of River Ruxu. Cao Caoâs soldiers at once
retired in great haste. A company led by the green-eyed, purple-bearded Sun
Quan made straight for Cao Cao, who hastily retreated. But Cao Cao was sore
pressed by other Sun Quanâs commanders, Han Dang and Zhou Tai, and it had
gone hard with him but that Xu Chu came to his rescue and fought with the
troops of the South Land till his master could escape. Xu Chu fought some score
bouts before he could draw off and return to his own aide.
When Cao Cao returned to camp, he conferred rich rewards upon his henchman who
had saved him, and he reprimanded his other leaders for their too hasty
retirement.
âYou blunt the keen spirits of the army. And if you do such a thing again, I
will put you to death,â said Cao Cao.
About midnight that night there arose great commotion at the gates of the camp.
When Cao Cao went outside, he found that the enemy had crept up secretly and
started a conflagration. The soldiers of the South Land forced their way into
the stockade and went hither and thither, slaying till morning broke. Then Cao
Cao and his army retired.
Cao Cao was greatly distressed by this misfortune. He was sitting in his tent
poring over the Book of War when Cheng Yu came in to see him.
âO Prime Minister,â said Cheng Yu, âyou who know so thoroughly the art of
war, have you forgotten the maxim to strike quickly? You had your army ready,
but you postponed action and allowed your enemies to build the ramparts at
River Ruxu. Now you will find it hard to capture the place. It would be better
now to retreat on the capital and await a more propitious moment.â
Cao Cao listened, but said nothing. After a time Cheng Yu went away. Cao Cao
remained seated in his tent, leaning on a small table by his side. And he fell
asleep. Suddenly he heard a sound as of a rushing stream or galloping squadrons
of horse, and out of the river in front of him arose a huge red sun, so bright
that his eyes were dazzled by it. Looking up at the sky, he saw two other suns
as if reflections of this one. And as he wondered, the first sun suddenly flew
up and then dropped among the hills in front of his camp with a roar like
thunder.
This woke him. He was in his tent and had been dreaming, and the sentry at his
tent door was just reporting noon.
Soon he had his horse saddled and rode out, with a small escort of fifty
riders, toward the spot he had seen in his dream. As he stood gazing around
him, an army of horse came along with Sun Quan at their head. Sun Quan wore a
glittering helmet and was clad in silver armor.
Seeing his chief enemy, Sun Quan showed no sign of haste or dismay, but reined
in his steed on a rise.
Pointing with his whip at Cao Cao, Sun Quan said, âBehold the all-powerful
minister who holds the Middle Land in the hollow of his hand! He has reached
the acme of wealth and good fortune and yet he is not content, but must come to
encroach upon our South Land.â
Cao Cao replied, âYou are disobedient, and the command of the Emperor is to
exterminate you!â
âWhat words!â cried Sun Quan with a laugh. âAre you not ashamed? Everyone
knows that you control every act of the Emperor and you tyrannize over the
nobles. I am no rebel against the dynasty, but I do desire to capture you and
reform the government.â
Cao Cao grew angry at this speech and bade his generals go over and take Sun
Quan prisoner. But before they could obey, Han Dang and Zhou Tai, Chen Wu and
Pan Zhang led out two armies of soldiers from left and right at the sound of
beating drums, and arrows and crossbow bolts began to fall like raindrops
around Cao Cao. He turned to retire, and the archers and bowmen followed him.
However, presently appeared Xu Chu, with the Tiger Guards, who rescued Cao Cao
and took him back to his camp. The army of the South Land had scored a victory,
and they marched back to River Ruxu.
Alone in his camp, Cao Cao thought, âThis Sun Quan certainly is no ordinary
man, and by the presage of the sun in my dream he will become an emperor.â
He began to think it would be well to retire from the expedition, only that he
feared the troops of the South Land would exult over him. So the two armies
remained facing each other a whole month, fighting occasional skirmishes and
battles in which victory fell sometimes to the one and sometimes to the other.
And so it went on till the new year, and the spring rains filled the
watercourses to overflowing, and the soldiers were wading in deep mud. Their
sufferings were extreme, and Cao Cao became sad at heart. At the council board
his officers were divided, some being for retirement and others anxious to hold
on till the warm weather. Their chief could not make up his mind.
Then there came a messenger from the South Land bearing a letter of Sun Quan,
which read:
âYou and I, O Prime Minister, are both servants of Han, but you are careless
for the tranquillity of the people and think only of battle, thereby causing
great suffering. Is this conduct worthy of a kindly person?
âBut spring with its heavy rains is at hand, and you would be wise to retire
while you can. If not, you may expect a repetition of the misfortune at the Red
Cliffs. It would be well to consider this.â
And on the back of the letter was a note in a line running thus: âNo
tranquillity for me while you live!â
Cao Cao read the letter and laughed.
âSun Quan speaks the truth!â said he.
He rewarded the messenger and issued orders to retreat. The Governor of
Lujiang, Zhu Guang, was left to guard Huancheng. The army marched for the
capital.
Sun Quan returned to Jianye.
At a meeting of his advisers Sun Quan said, âCao Cao has marched north, Liu
Bei is at Jiameng Pass. Why should I not lead the army that has just repulsed
the northern forces to take Jingzhou?â
Thereupon Zhang Zhao offered another plan, saying, âDo not move a soldier. I
know how to keep Liu Bei from returning to Jingzhou.â
Cao Caoâs army march away,
Sun Quanâs thoughts then southward stray.
The scheme proposed by Zhang Zhao will be unfolded in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 62 ****
Zhang Zhao proceeded to unfold his device: âIf you undertake any expedition
farther west, Cao Cao will undoubtedly return to the attack. Rather write two
letters, one to Liu Zhang saying that Liu Bei has leagued himself with you
against the west, which will raise suspicions in the mind of Liu Zhang and
cause him to attack his guest, and another letter persuading Zhang Lu to march
upon Jingzhou, which will uproot Liu Bei. Between these two conflicting
matters, Liu Bei cannot give supports to all fronts, and we can march against
Jingzhou.â
Sun Quan approved, wrote the two letters, and sent them by two messengers.
In the meantime, Liu Bei had been winning the hearts of the people about
Jiameng Pass, where his army lay. When he received the news of his wifeâs
flight and of Cao Caoâs attack on Ruxu, he called in Pang Tong and laid the
matter before him.
âThe victor of Ruxu, whoever it is, will assuredly possess himself of our
region of Jingzhou,â said Liu Bei at the close.
âYou need not trouble about that region,â said Pang Tong. âI do not think
the South Land or the Middle Land will try to take it so long as Zhuge Liang is
there. But, my lord, write to Liu Zhang telling him you wish to return on
account of this threatening danger. It will be a plausible excuse. You may say
that on account of Cao Caoâs attack, Sun Quan has sent to you for help, and
that as his country and yours are neighbors and dependent upon each other for
safety you cannot refuse. Further, you will assure him that there is no danger
of any invasion by Zhang Lu. However, we have too few troops for our purpose
and insufficient grain, so you must also urge your relative to send you thirty
or forty thousand of veterans and a plentiful supply of food. He will not
refuse, and with more soldiers and provisions we can do as we please.â
Liu Bei agreed to this and sent a messenger to Chengdu. When his messenger
reached the River Fu Pass, Yang Huai and Gao Pei, who commanded the garrison,
already knew of the design, and the former of the two generals went with him to
the city.
After reading the letter, the Imperial Protector asked Yang Huai, âWhy did
you come with the messenger?â
âOnly because of that letter,â Yang Huai replied. âThis Liu Bei, from the
day he first entered Yizhou, has been trying to win over the hearts of your
people by a display of kindness and virtue. He certainly intends no good, and I
think you should refuse both the troops and the supplies he asks. To help him
is like adding fuel to a fire.â
âWe are affectionate brothers, and I must help him,â said the Imperial
Protector.
âLiu Bei is nothing but a vagabond swashbuckler,â someone cried, âand if
you keep him here in the west, you are loosing a tiger in your household. If
you give him the troops and supplies he asks, you are adding wings to your
tiger.â
Turning whence the voice proceeded, they recognized the speaker as one Liu Ba,
a native of Lingling. His words threw the Imperial Protector into a state of
doubt and hesitation. Huang Quan also dissuaded him most earnestly, and finally
Liu Zhang actually decided to send only four thousand of worn-out soldiers and
a paltry supply of grain. At the same time fresh orders enjoining a diligent
watchfulness were sent to the guardians of the passes.
When Liu Bei read the letter that accompanied the Imperial Protectorâs
miserable contribution to his strength, he was furious and cried, âI have
been spending myself in your defense, and this is my reward! You are mean and
greedy enough to stint my supplies. How can you expect generous service?â
Liu Bei tore the letter to fragments and execrated the writer thereof. The
bearer of the letter fled back to the capital.
Then said Pang Tong, âYou have hitherto laid too much stress on humanity and
righteousness. However, that is all over now, and all affection between you two
is at an end, now that you have torn up that letter.â
âYes. And since that is so, what next?â asked Liu Bei.
âI have three schemes ready in my mind. You may choose which pleases you.â
âWhat are your three schemes?â
âThe first, and best, is to send an army forthwith and seize Chengdu. The
second is to capture and put to death the two generals of the River Fu Pass.
They are the two most famous fighting men in this land. If you give out that
you are returning to Jingzhou, they will assuredly come to say farewell. Seize
and put them to death, and the Pass and Fucheng are both yours. Chengdu will
follow soon. The third plan is to drop this role you have been playing, go back
to Jingzhou and make a regular invasion. But if you ponder these schemes too
long, you will get into such straits that nothing can save you.â
Liu Bei replied, âOf your three schemes, O Instructor, I find the first too
summary and the last too slow. I choose the second scheme, which is neither.â
So a letter was written to Liu Zhang saying that Cao Cao was sending an army
against Qingni, and since the generals there were unequal to the defense, Liu
Bei had to go to help. As the matter was pressing, there could be no personal
leave-taking.
âI knew that the real desire of Liu Bei was to return to Jingzhou,â said
Zhang Song, when he heard of the letter to Liu Zhang.
Zhang Song then also composed a letter to Liu Bei. While he was looking about
for a trusty person to take it, his brother Zhang Su, who was the Governor of
Guanghan, came to see him. Zhang Song hid the letter in his sleeve while he
talked with his brother. Zhang Su noticed his anxious inquietude, which he
could not explain. Wine was brought in and, as the two brothers chatted over
it, the letter dropped to the floor unnoticed by Zhang Song. One of Zhang
Suâs servants saw it, picked it up, and gave it to his master, who opened and
read it.
This is about how it ran:
âWhat I said to you lately was not mere meaningless talk. Why, then, postpone
action? The ancients valued the person who took by force and held by
conciliation. If you act at once, the whole matter is in your hand. Why abandon
all and return to Jingzhou? Surely I do not hear aright! When you get this
letter, attack without a momentâs delay and remember that I am your ally on
the inside. Above all, no delay!â
âThis plot of my brotherâs will end in the destruction of the whole
family,â said Zhang Su. âI must get in the first word.â
So at once he went in and laid the whole matter before the Imperial Protector.
âI have always treated your brother so well!â said Liu Zhang, very angry.
Liu Zhang issued orders to arrest Zhang Song and behead him and all his
household in the market place.
Zhang Song, such as he have been but few,
Little thought he that a letter would betray
When he plotted for another. But success he never knew,
For himself there opened out a gory way.
Having thus learned of a real conspiracy to deprive him of his heritage, Liu
Zhang assembled his officers and asked their advice.
Huang Quan spoke out, saying, âPrompt action is needed. Send to every
strategic point telling them to increase the garrisons and keep careful guard
and, above all, prevent the entrance of any person from Jingzhou.â
Such orders were sent to all points of vantage where were garrisons.
In the meantime, carrying out Pang Tongâs scheme, Liu Bei had marched down to
Fucheng, where he halted and sent in a messenger to invite the two generals to
come forth and say farewell. But they did not respond immediately to this
invitation.
âWhat is the real meaning of this retirement?â said one to the other.
âThis Liu Bei ought to die,â said Gao Pei. âLet us hide daggers under our
dress and stab him at the place of farewell. That will end all our lordâs
troubles.â
âA most excellent plan,â said Yang Huai.
So they two, taking only a small escort of two hundred, went down out of the
Pass to say goodbye. Most of their forces were left in the camp.
On the way down to River Fu, Pang Tong had said to his master, âYou have need
to be on your guard against those two if they come to bid you farewell. If they
do not come, then the Pass must be attacked without delay.â
Just as he said this, a violent gust of wind overthrew the leading flag of the
army, and Liu Bei asked what this portended.
âThat means a surprise. Those two intend to assassinate you, so be on your
guard.â
Accordingly, Liu Bei put on double armor and girded on his sword in readiness.
When the two generals arrived, the army halted while the generals should pay
the farewell visit.
Then Pang Tong said to his two generals, Wei Yan and Huang Zhong, âHowever
many soldiers come down from the Pass, see to it that none return.â
The two generals of West River Land, Yang Huai and Gao Pei, armed with hidden
daggers, came up, their escort bearing gifts of sheep and wine. They marked no
precautions being taken against an attack and began to think their task of
murder would be an easy one. They were led in to where Liu Bei sat under a
tent, his adviser with him.
They said, âWe hear, O Imperial Uncle, that you contemplate a long march, and
therefore we come to offer a few poor gifts to speed you on your way.â
The cups of farewell were duly filled.
Then Liu Bei replied, âYou have a heavy responsibility to defend the Pass,
Generals. I pray you drink first.â
They drank. Then Liu Bei said, âI have a secret matter to talk over with
you.â
So all the two hundred soldiers of the escort were sent away and led to the
midst of the camp.
As soon as they had gone, Liu Bei shouted, âMy generals, lay hands upon these
two rebels!â
Thereupon Liu Feng and Guan Ping rushed out from behind the tent. The two
generals of the Pass were taken aback, but began to struggle. However, Liu Feng
and Guan Ping each seized one man and held him.
âYour lord and I are of the same house,â said Liu Bei. âWhy then have you
plotted against me and conspired to sow enmity between us?â
Pang Tong bade them search the captives, and the hidden daggers were found. So
both were ordered to immediate execution. However, Liu Bei hesitated and was
unwilling to confirm the sentence and put them to death. But his adviser
insisted that they were worthy of death for the assassination they had penned,
and bade the executioners fall on. So the two men were beheaded. Of their
following not one had been allowed to slip away.
Liu Bei summoned the soldiers of the escort to his tent, gave them wine to
comfort them, and said, âYour leaders conspired to sow dissension between
brothers and were found with daggers hidden beneath their clothing. They were
assassins in intent and have met the fate they merited. You have committed no
crime and need feel no alarm.â
The soldiers thanked him for his clemency with low obeisance.
Then said Pang Tong, âIf you will now show the way so that our troops may
capture the Pass, you shall even be rewarded.â
They consented. That same night the army set out, with the soldiers of the
renegade escort leading the way.
When they reached the Pass they hailed the gate, saying, âOpen the gate
quickly! The Generals have returned earlier than they expected because of
important business.â
Hearing the voices of their comrades, the gate guards had no suspicion of
treachery and threw open the gates. In rushed the enemy soldiers and so gained
possession of River Fu Pass without shedding a drop of blood. The defenders
came over to the side of Liu Bei and were liberally rewarded. This done, the
army was posted so as to guard the approaches and maintain what they had
captured.
The next few days were spent in banquets and feasts in celebration of success.
At one of these feasts, Liu Bei turned to his adviser, saying, âThis is what
one might call a joyful occasion.â
âTo employ warlike weapons in making an attack upon the possession of another
is not using them in the best way,â replied Pang Tong. âNor is such attack
the most proper occasion for rejoicing.â
Liu Bei replied, âThe success of King Wu of Zhou was celebrated with music. I
suppose weapons were not well used on that occasion either. Why do you talk so
wide of reason? You had better retire.â
Pang Tong laughed and withdrew from the table, while the attendants supported
Liu Bei to his own chamber, where he had a long sleep. About midnight he awoke
from his wine, and then the servants told him that he had driven sway his
adviser from the feast. He was at once filled with remorse. Next day, having
dressed early in full costume of ceremony, he took his seat in the great hall,
summoned his adviser and apologized handsomely for his rude behavior the night
before.
âI drank too much last night and spoke rudely. Pray forgive me.â
Pang Tong, who had taken the whole episode in very good part from the first,
laughed and talked as usual.
But Liu Bei went on, âReally I was the only one to blame yesterday.â
âWe both slipped up. It was not only you, my lord,â said Pang Tong.
Then Liu Bei laughed too, and the two were as good friends again as ever.
When Imperial Protector Liu Zhang heard of the doings of his relative and
guest, he said, âI did not think that such things would come to pass.â
The officers of Yizhou met to consider how to oppose the further advance of Liu
Bei.
Huang Quan said, âLet us send without delay a force to hold Luocheng, which
is the very throat of the road he must take. He may have veteran soldiers and
fiery generals, but he will not be able to pass.â
So the four ablest generals â-Deng Xiang, Ling Bao, Liu Gui, and Zhang Ren
â-were told off for this duty, and they led fifty thousand troops.
As they marched, Liu Gui said, âIn the Silky Hills there is a wonderful
Daoist who calls himself âThe Super Human of the Dark Void.â He has the
gift of second sight, so let us visit him as we pass and inquire what our
fortunes are to be.â
âWhat should one seek of a hermit when one is out to repulse an enemy?â
said his colleague, Zhang Ren, contemptuously.
âYour view is wrong,â said Liu Gui. âThe Holy One (Confucius) has said
that it is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknow.
So let us inquire of this man of high intelligence that we may know what to do
and what to avoid.â
Whereupon they went up into the hills and sought the hermitâs retreat. They
were a small party, on horseback. Meeting a wood-cutter, they inquired the
whereabouts of the dwelling of the wise man, and he pointed to one of the
highest hills, saying that the Sage lived on the very summit. They climbed up
to the spot he had told them of and found a small hut. At their summons, a lad
in Daoist garb came out to speak with them. He asked their names and led them
into the presence of the Super Human, who received them seated on a rush
cushion. They made a low obeisance, told him the reason of their coming, and
asked of the future.
âHow can a poor Daoist recluse know ought of fortunes, good or evil?â said
he.
However, after a time, as Liu Gui repeated his request again and again and
comported himself most humbly, the hermit bade the lad bring paper and ink and
he wrote eight lines, which he handed to his questioner.
âSupported by dragon and phoenix,
So flies he westward.
But the phoenix shall fall to the earth.
And the dragon shall soar to the sky;
There shall be successes and failures,
For such is the eternal law.
See that ye act when occasion offers,
Lest ye descend to the Nine Golden Springs.â
Having read the oracle, they pressed the seer to reveal them their individual
fortunes, but he replied, âWhy ask these things? None can escape his fate.â
Liu Gui ventured to question the Sage further, but his eyelids dropped as if he
slumbered. Nor would he vouchsafe a word more, and the four generals took leave
and descended the hill.
âOne must have faith in such as he says,â said Liu Gui.
âWhat is to be gained by listening to the sayings of a daft old man?â
replied Zhang Ren.
So they continued their road to Luocheng.
When they arrived, Liu Gui said, âLuocheng is the throat of the road to
Chengdu. We must create a pincers defense for the city. Two of us are to guard
the ramparts while the other two are to station themselves in front of the
city, where is a point of vantage sheltered by some hills.â
Thus Deng Xiang and Ling Bao wanted to build the ramparts outside the city.
Twenty thousand troops were told off. The two generals went to establish two
camps in two stockades twenty miles away, hoping to be able to keep the foe
away from the city.
The River Fu Pass being captured, Liu Bei took counsel with his adviser as to
the next point to be attempted. This was Luocheng.
The scouts reported: âLiu Zhang has sent four generals to the defense of that
city, and two camps has been established twenty miles away to form an ox
horn.â
Then Liu Bei assembled his officers and asked who would go to attack the camps.
The veteran Huang Zhong offered himself.
âVeteran General, take your own troops and go,â said Liu Bei. âA goodly
reward shall be yours if you capture the two camps.â
Huang Zhong thanked his lord and was just leading away his troops when suddenly
up spoke a youthful leader, saying, âThe General is too old to go on such an
expedition. I am of poor ability, but I wish to take his place.â
The speaker was Wei Yan.
Huang Zhong replied, âI already have my commission. Why should you wish to
supplant me?â
âBecause the task is beyond an old manâs strength,â said Wei Yan. âThe
two generals in those camps we know are the best and boldest in the country.
They are strong, and, veteran as you are, I fear you will be unable to overcome
them. If you fail, our lordâs great design will be hindered. Therefore I ask
that I may replace you, and my intent is kindly.â
This reminder of his age angered the old man.
âOld, am I? Dare you compete with me in the use of warlike weapons?â said
Huang Zhong.
âYes, I dare. And our lord shall be the judge. The winner shall undertake
this expedition. Do you agree?â
Huang Zhong ran down the steps and called to his soldiers to bring his sword.
But Liu Bei would stop this contest and said, âI have need of both of you in
the task that lies before me. When two tigers fight, one is sure to lose; and
the loss of either of you is more than I could bear. Be reconciled and quarrel
no more.â
âYou two must not quarrel,â said Pang Tong. âBut as there are two camps
to be taken and two generals to fight, take one each and let each lead his own
troops. The first to capture his camp shall be held to have rendered the
greater service and to have acquired the greater merit.â
This decision pacified them, and it was settled that Huang Zhong, the veteran,
should go against Ling Bao, and Wei Yan, the younger leader, should attack Deng
Xiang.
But after they had marched away, Pang Tong recommended, âYou, my lord, should
follow them lest they should quarrel on the way.â
So leaving the city of Fucheng in care of his adviser, Liu Bei also marched,
taking with him Liu Feng, his adopted son, and Guan Ping, his nephew by
adoption. They took five thousand troops.
After having received the command to take one of the camps, Huang Zhong went to
his own camp and issued orders for the morning meal to be ready very early, and
for everyone to be in marching order by daybreak. When the time arrived, his
army set out, taking the road through a gully to the left of the hills.
But early as Huang Zhong started, his rival had stolen a march on him. Wei Yan
had sent over the night before to find out the hour fixed for Huang Zhongâs
start and had arranged his own departure a watch earlier, by which he would be
able to reach his objective at dawn. After Wei Yanâs troops had taken their
early meal, they removed the bells from the horses end put gags in their own
mouths to prevent talking, and all-silently the army stole out of the camp just
as the other party were eating their breakfast. The ensigns were furled and
weapons covered lest the glint of steel should betray their movement.
Thus far successful in getting the start of his rival, Wei Yan thought as he
rode along what a fine score he would make if he anticipated Huang Zhong also
in his attack and captured the camp of Ling Bao before Huang Zhong could get
there. Wei Yan at once deviated from his own line and marched toward the camp
defended by Ling Bao, of which the capture had been assigned to Huang Zhong.
Just before arrival, Wei Yan halted his troops and bade them prepare the drums
and ensigns and their weapons.
Early as it was, yet the camp commander was on the alert, for the advancing
force had been observed by his scouts. At the first sign of attack, the
defenders poured out in full force. Wei Yan galloped up and made straight for
Ling Bao. These two fought twenty or so of bouts, and then the troops of West
River Land came up and joined in the battle. The troops of Jingzhou under Wei
Yan having marched a long distance, were fatigued and could not withstand this
onslaught, so they fell back. Wei Yan heard the confused sound of hoofs behind
him and, giving up all thought of finishing his encounter with Ling Bao, turned
his horse and fled. The troops of West River Land kept up the pursuit, and the
attackers were defeated and retired.
They had gone about two miles when another army of Yizhou appeared from behind
some hills. They advanced with heating drums. Their leader, Deng Xiang, shouted
to Wei Yan to surrender, but Wei Yan heeded him not; whipping up his steed he
fled the faster. However, the tired horse tripped and fell on its knees,
throwing its rider to the ground. Deng Xiangâs forces came galloping up, and
he himself set his spear to thrust and slay Wei Yan. Before the spear could get
where it was supposed to be, twang! went a bowstring, and Deng Xiang lay prone
upon the earth.
Ling Bao, Deng Xiangâs colleague, rode up quickly to his rescue, but just
then a body of horse came dashing down the hill, and their leader shouted,
âGeneral Huang Zhong is here!â
With uplifted sword Huang Zhong rode toward Ling Bao, who turned his steed and
galloped off to the rear. Huang Zhong pursued, and the army of Yizhou were
thrown into confusion. So Huang Zhong was able to rescue his colleague Wei Yan.
Huang Zhong had thus slain Deng Xiang and forced his way up to the gate of the
camp. Once again Ling Bao came and engaged Huang Zhong. The two had fought some
ten bouts when appeared another body of soldiers. Thereupon Ling Bao fled
again, and this time he made for the other camp, abandoning his own to the
troops of Jingzhou.
But when he drew near his camp, he saw no longer the familiar flags of his own
side. Instead, alien banners fluttered in the breeze. He checked his steed and
stared at the new force. The leader was a general wearing a silver breastplate
and clad in a silken robe, no other than Liu Bei himself. On his left was his
son and on his right rode his nephew.
âWhither would you come?â cried Liu Bei. âThe camp is ours. I have
captured it.â
Now Liu Bei had led his troops in the track of the other two armies ready to
help either in case of need. He had come across the empty and undefended camp
and taken possession.
Left with no place of refuge, Ling Bao set off along a byway to try to get back
to Luocheng. He had not gone far when he fell into an ambush and was taken
prisoner. Bound with cords he was taken to the camp of Liu Bei.
The ambush had been prepared by Wei Yan, who, knowing he had committed a fault,
had collected as many of his soldiers as he could find and made some of the
captured soldiers of Yizhou guide him to a spot suitable for laying an ambush.
Liu Bei had hoisted the flag of amnesty for his enemies, and whenever any
soldier of the West River Land laid down his weapons and stripped off his armor
he was spared. Also all the wounded were granted life. Liu Bei told his enemies
that they had liberty of choice.
He said, âYou soldiers have parents and wives and little ones at home, and
those who wish to return to them are free to go. If any wish to join my army,
they also will be received.â
At this proof of generosity the sound of rejoicing filled the land.
Having made his camp, Huang Zhong came to Liu Bei and said, âWei Yan should
be put to death for disobedience!â
The culprit was summoned and came, bringing with him his prisoner. Liu Bei
decided that the merit of capturing an enemy should be set against his fault
and bade him thank his rescuer, enjoining upon them both to quarrel no more.
Wei Yan bowed his head and confessed his fault, and Huang Zhong was handsomely
rewarded.
The prisoner was then taken before Liu Bei to decide upon his fate. Liu Bei
loosened Ling Baoâs bonds by his own hands and gave him the cup of
consolation. After he had drunk, Liu Bei asked if he was willing to surrender.
âSince you give me my life, I can do no other,â said he. âMoreover, my
two companions, Liu Gui and Zhang Ren, and I are sworn to live or die together.
If you will release me, I will return and bring them also to you and therewith
you will get possession of Luocheng.â
Liu Bei gladly accepted the offer. He gave Ling Bao clothing and a horse and
bade him go to the city to carry out his plan.
âDo not let him go,â said Wei Yan. âIf you do, you will never see him
again.â
Liu Bei replied, âIf I treat humans with kindness and justice, they will not
betray my trust.â
So the prisoner was set free.
When Ling Bao reached the city and saw his two friends, he told them, saying,
âI slew many of the enemy and escaped by mounting the steed of one of
them.â
Ling Bao said no word of having been captured. Messengers were sent in haste to
Chengdu for help.
The loss of his general, Deng Xiang, disturbed the Imperial Protector greatly.
He called his advisers together to consult.
Then his eldest son, Liu Xun, said, âFather, let me go to defend Luocheng.â
âYou may go, my son, but who is there to go with you?â
One Wu Yi at once offered himself. He was brother-in-law to Liu Zhang.
Liu Zhang said, âIt is well that you go, brother-in-law, but who will second
you?â
Wu Yi at once recommended two men, Wu Lan and Lei Tong, who were appointed to
assist in the command. Twenty thousand troops were given them, and they set out
for Luocheng. Liu Gui and Zhang Ren came out to welcome them and told them what
had happened.
Wu Yi said, âIf the enemy draw near to the walls, it will be hard to drive
them off again. What do you two think should be done?â
Ling Bao replied, âThe city lies along River Fu and the current is strong.
The enemy camp lies low at the foot of the hills. With five thousand people I
can cut the river banks, flood their camp, and drown Liu Bei and his army with
him.â
The plan was approved, and Ling Bao went away to carry it out. Wu Lan and Lei
Tong were told off to supervise the workers. They began to prepare the tools
for cutting the bank.
Leaving Huang Zhong and Wei Yan in command of the two camps, Liu Bei went away
to Fucheng to consult with Pang Tong, the armyâs instructor. Intelligence had
been received that Sun Quan had sent a messenger to seek to make a league with
Zhang Lu to make a joint attack upon the Jiameng Pass, and Liu Bei was alarmed
lest it should come to pass.
âIf they do that, I am taken in the rear and helpless in both advance and
retreat,â said he. âWhat do you counsel, O Instructor?â
Pang Tong turned to Meng Da, saying, âYou are a native of Shu and well
skilled in its topography. What can be done to make the Pass secure?â
âLet me take a certain man with me, and I will defend it myself and answer
for its safety.â
âWho is he?â asked Liu Bei.
âHe was formerly an officer under Liu Biao. His name is Huo Jun, and he is a
native of Nanjun in the south.â
This offer was accepted, and the two generals departed.
After the council, when Pang Tong returned to his lodging, the doorkeeper told
him that a visitor had arrived. When Pang Tong went out to receive him, he saw
a huge tall fellow eight cubits in stature and of noble countenance. His hair
had been cut short and hung upon his neck. He was poorly dressed.
âWho may you be, Master?â asked Pang Tong.
The visitor made no reply, but went at once straight up the room and lay upon
the couch. Pang Tong felt very suspicious of the man and repeated his question.
Pressed again, the visitor said, âDo let me rest a little. Then I will talk
with you about everything in the world.â
This answer only added to the mystery and increased the hostâs suspicion, but
he had wine and food brought in, of which the guest partook ravenously. Having
eaten, he lay down and fell asleep.
Pang Tong wag greatly puzzled and thought the man must be a spy. He sent for Fa
Zheng, met him in the courtyard, and told him about the strange visitor.
âSurely it can be no other than Peng Yang,â said Fa Zheng.
Fa Zheng went inside and looked.
Immediately the visitor jumped up, saying, âI hope you have been well since
we parted last!â
Because two old friends meet again,
A riverâs fatal flood is checked.
The next chapter will explain who the stranger was.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******

laughing with pleasure.
âThis is Peng Yang of Guanghan, one of our heroes. His blunt speech, however,
offended Imperial Protector Liu Zhang, who put him to shame by shaving his
head, loading him with fetters, and forcing him into a monastery. That is why
his hair is short.â
The introduction made, Pang Tong treated the stranger with all the courtesy due
to a guest and asked why he had come.
âTo save a myriad of your soldiersâ lives. I will explain fully when I see
General Liu Bei.â
A message was sent to Liu Bei, who came over to see the visitor.
âHow many troops have you, General?â asked Peng Yang, when Liu Bei arrived.
Liu Bei told him.
âAs a leader you cannot be ignorant of the lie of the land. Your camps over
there are on River Fu. If the river be diverted and the enemy hold your army in
front and rear, not a soul can escape.â
Liu Bei realized that this was true.
Peng Yang continued, âIn the heaven, the bowl of the Dipper lies toward the
west, and Venus stands over against us. The aspect is ominous of evil, and some
misfortune threatens. It must be warded off.â
Liu Bei offered Peng Yang an appointment as an adviser. Then he sent messages
to the generals at the camps telling them to keep most vigilant look-out to
guard against the cutting of the river bank. When this message came, Huang
Zhong and Wei Yan agreed together to take duty day and night about and maintain
the strict watch necessary in the presence of an enemy near at hand. They
arranged means of communication in case either met with a body of the enemy.
One very stormy night, Ling Bao ventured out with a strong party of five
thousand and went along the river bank to seek a suitable place for the breach.
But a sudden shouting in his rear told him that the army of Jingzhou were on
the alert, and he at once retired. Wei Yan came in pursuit and, as he pressed
nearer, Ling Baoâs troops hurried forward, trampling each other down in their
haste. Suddenly Ling Bao and Wei Yan ran against each other, and they engaged.
The fight was very short, for Wei Yan soon took his opponent prisoner. Wu Lan
and Lei Tong who came to Ling Baoâs rescue were easily beaten off, and Ling
Bao was carried away. When Wei Yan reached the Pass, Liu Bei saw Ling Bao and
greatly blamed him for his base ingratitude.
âI treated you generously and set you free, yet you repaid me with
ingratitude. I cannot forgive again.â
So the prisoner was beheaded, and his captor was rewarded. A banquet was given
in honor of Peng Yang.
Soon after this came a letter from Zhuge Liang, by the hand of Ma Liang, who
reported all calm in Jingzhou and told Liu Bei that he need feel no anxiety.
Opening the letter, Liu Bei read:
âI have been making some astrological calculations. This is the last year of
the cycle, the bowl of the Dipper is in the western quarter, and the planet
Venus approaches Luocheng. The configuration is inimical to leaders, and the
utmost caution is necessary.â
Having read this and sent Ma Liang away, Liu Bei said, âI will return myself
to Jingzhou and discuss the matter.â
But Pang Tong opposed this, for he thought in his heart that Zhuge Liangâs
warning was due to a jealous desire to prevent him from winning the glory of
conducting a victorious campaign in West River Land.
Therefore Pang Tong said, âI also have made calculations, and I read the
signs to mean that the time is favorable for you to get possession of this
land, and no evil is foreshown. Therefore be not of doubtful heart, my lord,
but advance boldly.â
Liu Bei was won over and decided to follow Pang Tongâs advice. He ordered
Huang Zhong and Wei Yan to lead.
Pang Tong asked of Fa Zheng what roads there were to follow, and the latter
drew a map, which was found to agree exactly with that left by Zhang Song.
Fa Zheng said, âNorth of the mountains is a high road leading to the east
gate. South of the mountains is another path leading to the west gate. Both
these roads are suitable for the advance of an army.â
So Pang Tong said to Liu Bei, âWith Wei Yan to lead the way, I will go along
the southern road, while you, my lord, will advance along the high road, with
Huang Zhong in the van. We will attack Luocheng at the same time.â
Liu Bei replied, âI was trained as a mounted archer and am accustomed to by-
roads, wherefore, O Instructor, I think you should take the high road and let
me take the other.â
âThere will be opposition on the high road, and you are the best to deal with
it. Let me take the by-road.â
âNo, this does not suit me,â replied Liu Bei. âA spirit bearing a massive
iron club appeared to me in a dream and struck my right arm, so that I suffered
great pain. I feel sure this expedition will turn out badly.â
Pang Tong replied, âWhen a soldier goes into battle, he may be killed, or he
may be wounded. He accepts whichever is his fate. But should one hesitate
because of a dream?â
âThe real reason of my hesitation is the letter from Zhuge Liang. Wherefore I
wish you to remain and guard River Fu Pass. Do you agree to that?â
Pang Tong smiled, saying, âZhuge Liang has indeed filled your mind with
doubts. The real thing is that he is unwilling to let me have the merit of
accomplishing a great undertaking alone. That is why he has written this. And
your doubts and hesitations have produced the dream. But I see nothing ill-
omened, and I am prepared for any sacrifice and mean just what I say. Pray, my
lord, say no more, but prepare to set forth.â
So the order went forth that the morning meal was to be taken early and the
army was to march at dawn. Huang Zhong and Wei Yan were to take the lead, one
along each road. These two set out first, and in due time Liu Bei and Pang Tong
mounted and followed. Suddenly Pang Tongâs horse shied and stumbled, throwing
him off.
Liu Bei jumped down and seized the horse by the bridle, saying, âWhy do you
ride this wretched beast?â
âI have ridden him a long time, and he has never done this before,â was the
reply.
âA shying steed risks a personâs life,â said Liu Bei. âRide my horse,
which is thoroughly trained and will never fail you. Give me yours.â
They exchanged horses.
âI am deeply affected by your kindness,â said Pang Tong. âI could never
repay you if I suffered death a thousand times.â
Soon their ways diverged. After his adviser had left, Liu Bei felt ill at ease
and rode gloomily.
When the news of Ling Baoâs capture and death reached Luocheng, Wu Yi and Liu
Gui took counsel together.
Their colleague, Zhang Ren, said, âI know a by-road on the southeast which is
of great importance, and I pray you let me guard it while you two hold the
city.â
So as soon as the news of the advancing armies came, Zhang Ren led three
thousand troops to this by-road and placed them in ambush. They remained hidden
while Wei Yan passed and made no attack. The main body under Pang Tong soon
followed.
The soldiers in ambush saw a rider on a fine white horse and pointed him out to
one another, saying, âThat surely is Liu Bei on the white horse!â
Their leader Zhang Ren rejoiced too, and he gave certain orders.
Pang Tong hastened forward. By and by the mountain road narrowed to a defile
with dense thickets on either hand, and as the season was when summer changes
into autumn, the foliage was thick and impenetrable. His heart alarmed him, and
presently he reined in his steed and asked if any knew the name of that place.
One of the soldiers of Yizhou who had joined his army said, âThis is called
âThe Fallen Phoenix Slopeâ.â
Pang Tong shuddered. âAn evil omen for me, since Young Phoenix is my Daoist
name. There is no luck for me here!â
He decided to retire. But as he gave the order, the roar of a bomb rent the air
and arrows began to fly toward him thick as swarming locusts. All the hidden
men were shooting at the rider of the white horse. And there, wounded by many
arrows, poor Pang Tong died at the age of thirty-six.
A poem says:
Deep in the blue recesses of Xian Hills
Lay hid the modest cot of Pang Tong.
But now each village urchin knows his story,
And any village rustic tells his exploits.
He knew the empire must be triply rent,
And far he traveled lonely, to and fro.
None knew that Heaven would cast down his star,
Forbidding his return in glory clad.
A song was also written referring to Pang Tong:
They were two, the Phoenix and the Dragon,
And they would travel far to the west;
But on the road thither
The Phoenix died on the mountain slope.
The wind drives off the rain,
The rain sends off the wind.
It was the day of the Han restoration,
When the west was attained,
But in the attainment
The Dragon was alone.
Not only was the leader of the expedition slain, but more than half of his
soldiers fell in the narrow road that fatal day. Some of the troops in the van
escaped and ran off to tell Wei Yan of the mishap to the army, and he halted
and turned back to help. However, it was difficult to march back, and he could
not hack a way through, for the road was held by Zhang Ren, and archers and
crossbowmen occupied all the heights.
Then one of the renegades proposed that they should try to return along the
high road, and they started for Luocheng this way. But in front of them arose a
great cloud of dust, betraying the approach of an enemy. Wu Lan and Lei Tong,
the defenders of the city, were moving toward them, and Wei Yan was between the
two armies closed in like the kernel of a nut. Wei Yan fought hard to get
through. When his case seemed most desperate and hopeless, he observed signs of
confusion in the army that lay between him and the city. Soon that army turned
and faced the other way. He pressed forward and presently saw troops of his own
side, led by the veteran Huang Zhong.
âI will rescue you, Wei Yan!â shouted Huang Zhong, as he came near.
Now the defenders of Luocheng found themselves between two enemies, and they
were smitten heavily. They could not check Wei Yan and Huang Zhong, who got
close to the very walls of Luocheng. Seeing them near, Liu Gui, who had been
left to defend the city, poured out against them. Thereupon Huang Zhong and Wei
Yan, in spite of the nearness of the army of Liu Bei, refused battle and turned
sway from the city.
Liu Beiâs army made a dash for two stockades, but when Zhang Ren came along
the by-road, and the other three defenders of the city came on, the stockades
could not be held, and Liu Beiâs army had to retire. Now fighting and now
marching, the army of Liu Bei strove hard to reach River Fu Pass, but Zhang Ren
pressed close. However, Liu Feng and Guan Ping came up, and not only drove back
the pursuers but chased them some seven miles. Finally, Liu Bei and his troops
reached the Pass, weary and dispirited. His son and nephew returned from the
pursuit with many horses they had captured from the flying enemy. However,
nothing had been gained and the victory lay rather with the army of the West
River Land.
Liu Bei sent to inquire about Pang Tong. One of the fugitives from the army
finally reached River Fu Pass and told Liu Bei of the sad news â-man and
horse wounded to death. Liu Bei turned his face to the west and mourned
bitterly.
Although the body of the slain leader lay far away, they instituted sacrifice
to call the spirit, and all the generals keened for him.
Then said Huang Zhong, âNow that our leader is no more, certainly the enemy
will return to attack the Pass. What is to be done? I think we had better send
to Jingzhou for Zhuge Liang and get him to lay plans for getting possession of
the West River Land.â
And even then came in one to say that the enemy under Zhang Ren had come and
were now offering a challenge at the rampart.
Huang Zhong and Wei Yan wished to go forth to fight, but Liu Bei disapproved,
saying, âWe have suffered a severe check, and the soldiers are low-spirited.
Let us rather remain on the defensive until the Directing Instructor can
arrive.â
Huang Zhong and Wei Yan made no objection, but set themselves to guard the Pass
most vigilantly, while a letter was written to Zhuge Liang and sent by the hand
of Guan Ping. He set forth at once, and Liu Bei gave himself up to holding the
Pass.
In Jingzhou, it was the seventh day of the seventh moon, and in the evening
Zhuge Liang invited his officers to a banquet. Conversation turned toward the
enterprise in the West River Land. Suddenly a large and brilliant meteor
appeared falling in the west, illuminating the whole sky. It so disturbed the
host that he dashed his wine cup to the ground, covered his face, and burst
into tears.
âAlas! Alas!â
The guests eagerly asked him why he wept.
Zhuge Liang replied, âI knew by my calculations that the bowl of the Dipper
would be in the west at this season and that the auspices would be unfavorable
to leaders of armies, and lo! the Heavens have gone against our army. When
Venus was about to stand over Luocheng, I wrote to our lord warning him to be
very cautious. I never contemplated the falling of the star this evening. Now
Pang Tong is no more.â
Again he fell to weeping. âMy lord has lost an arm!â moaned he.
The guests were rather disturbed, but they only half believed that such a
misfortune had happened.
âWe shall hear the sad news in a very few days,â said Zhuge Liang.
The banquet ended sadly enough, and the guests went their ways. A few days
later, while Zhuge Liang was sitting with Guan Yu and a few others, they
reported the arrival of Guan Ping with letters from the west. When the letters
were opened, they knew that Pang Tong had fallen the same evening that the
meteor had appeared.
Zhuge Liang wailed, and the others wept with him.
Then Zhuge Liang said, âI must go to help our lord. He is hemmed in at the
Pass and cannot move.â
âIf you go away, who will guard this region?â asked Guan Yu. âIt is of
very great importance.â
âOur lord has not written plainly, but I know what was in his mind.â Then
he showed the letter to the others and said, âProvision for the defense of
this region is laid upon me, and I am to find one equal to the task. I read the
letter to mean that he desires Guan Yu to undertake the defense, and I know
that Guan Yu will do it for the sake of the pledge taken long ago in the Peach
Garden. The task is no light one.â
Guan Yu accepted without hesitation or thought of excuse. A special banquet was
prepared at which the seal was to be handed over to him.
âAll the future rests with you, General,â said Zhuge Liang as he raised the
symbol of office to place it in the hands of the leader.
âWhen a person of honor accepts such a task, he is only released by death,â
replied Guan Yu.
But that ill-omened word âdeathâ displeased Zhuge Liang, and even then he
would have retracted but that Guan Yuâs word had gone forth. Zhuge Liang went
on.
âNow if Cao Cao attacks what is to be done?â said Zhuge Liang.
âRepel him with all my strength.â
âBut if Cao Cao and Sun Quan attack you together, what then?â
âFight both; half my force against each.â
Zhuge Liang said, âIn that case, Jingzhou would be in danger. I will give you
my advice in a few words, and if you remember them the region is safe.â
âWhat are these few words?â asked Guan Yu.
âNorth, fight Cao Cao; south, ally with Sun Quan.â
âThese words, O Instructor, are engraved on my heart.â
Thereupon the seal was placed in his hands. Zhuge Liang also appointed tried
and worthy people to assist the new commander. Guan Yuâs civil staff included
Ma Liang, Mi Zhu, and Yi Ji; and on military side, he was assisted by Mi Fang,
Liao Hua, Guan Ping, and Zhou Cang.
This done, Zhuge Liang began to prepare for his march to the River Lands. Zhang
Fei, with ten thousand troops, was sent to fight his way into the country west
of Bazhou and Luocheng, and he was to go with all speed. The earlier he got
through, the greater merit would be his. Zhao Zilong was to lead a force up the
Great River and make a junction at Luocheng. Zhuge Liang, with his own body of
fifteen thousand troops, would follow.
Among those who followed Zhuge Liang were Jian Yong and one Jiang Wan. Jiang
Wan was a noted scholar from Lingling, and he held the office of Secretary.
Zhuge Liang and Zhang Fei set out the same day.
Just before leaving, the Directing Instructor said to Zhang Fei, âDo not
think lightly of the soldiers of Yizhou, for there are many mighty warriors
among them. On the march restrain your soldiers from plunder and license lest
the ordinary people be against us. Wherever you halt, be compassionate and
kindly and do not give way to anger and flog your soldiers. I shall expect you
to reach Luocheng very soon.â
Zhang Fei joyously mounted and left. He marched rapidly, and on the way all
places that surrendered suffered nothing whatever.
When they drew near the county of Bazhou, the scouts of West River Land sent
out by the Governor of that place informed their master, Yan Yan. This Yan Yan
was one of the famous generals of Yizhou, and even then, although he was rather
old, he had lost none of his boldness and could still pull the stiffest bow and
wield the heaviest sword.
Being so famous, Yan Yan was not the man to surrender at the first approach of
an enemy. So when Zhang Fei came near, he cautiously encamped about three miles
from the city. Thence he sent a messenger to summon the Governor to surrender.
Zhang Fei said, âTell the old fool to give in, or I will trample down his
walls and leave no soul alive.â
Yan Yan had never favored inviting Liu Bei into Yizhou.
When he had first heard of the Imperial Protectorâs intention, he said,
âThis is like calling a tiger to protect a person when that person is alone
on a bare hill side.â
When he heard of the seizure of River Fu Pass, he was very angry and offered
again and again to lead an army and drive out the aggressors. He had feared
that his city would be attacked along this very road, so he had prepared his
army, and when Zhang Feiâs message came, he mustered them, five thousand or
so, to oppose him.
Then a certain person said to Yan Yan, âYou must be careful how you oppose a
man who by the mere sound of his voice scared the many legions of Cao Cao at
Long Slope Bridge. Even Cao Cao himself was careful to keep out of his way.
Your safety is in defense, lying behind your ramparts and within your deep
moats till hunger shall have vanquished your enemies. This Zhang Fei has a very
violent temper. If he is provoked, he vents his anger in flogging his soldiers.
If you avoid battle, he will be irritated; and his cruelty to his soldiers will
cause them to mutiny. Then you can attack and will succeed.â
Yan Yan thought the advice good. He therefore resolved only to defend, and he
set all his soldiers on the walls. When one of Zhang Feiâs soldiers came up
to the gate and shouted for them to open, Yan Yan gave orders to open the gate
and admit the man. When the soldier had come within, he gave the submission
demand as has been related before.
But the Governor was exceedingly angry and said, âFool that you are! How dare
you speak thus to me? Think you that I, General Yan Yan, will surrender to such
as him. By your mouth indeed will I send a message.â
Then Yan Yan bade the executioner cut off the manâs ears and nose. And thus
mutilated he returned to Zhang Fei. When Zhang Fei heard of it, his wrath
boiled up and he cursed the defender of the city. Grinding his teeth and
glaring with rage, he put on his armor, mounted his steed, and went up close to
the walls with a few mounted followers, and challenged those on the ramparts to
fight him. But the defenders on the walls only replied with shameful abuse, and
none accepted the challenge. Zhang Fei galloped again and again to the
drawbridge, only to be driven off each time with flights of arrows. But not a
man came outside the walls. As the day closed in, the warrior, still fuming
with wrath, returned to his own camp.
Next day Zhang Fei again led his troops to the foot of the wall and challenged.
Again the challenge was refused. But Yan Yan shot an arrow from the tower that
struck Zhang Feiâs helmet. This angered him still more.
Pointing the finger of disdain at his enemy, Zhang Fei cried, âI will capture
you yet, you old fool, and then I will devour your flesh!â
So again at eventide the troops of Jingzhou returned to camp bucking their
desire. On the third day Zhang Fei and his troops made the circuit of the city
along the edge of the moat, hurling insults at their enemies.
It so happened that the city was set on a hill with rugged heights all round,
so that going around it the assailants were sometimes on hill tops and
sometimes on the level. While standing on one of the hills, Zhang Fei noticed
that he could see clear down into the city. There stood the defenders in their
ranks, all ready for battle although none of them came out. And the common
people went to and fro carrying bricks and bringing stones to strengthen the
defenses. Then Zhang Fei ordered his horsemen to dismount and his footmen to
sit down so that they could not be seen from the city. He hoped thus to cheat
the defenders into thinking that there were none to attack and so induce them
to come out. But this also was vain, for still the defenders declined battle,
and another day was lost. The army once more returned to camp.
That night Zhang Fei sat in his tent trying to think out some means to overcome
an enemy that steadily refused to come out from behind the walls. Presently,
however, the brain behind the knitted brows conceived a plan. So next day,
instead of sending all the troops to offer a challenge from the foot of the
wall, Zhang Fei kept most of them in camp and sent only a few to howl insults
and hurl abuse. He hoped by this means to inveigle Yan Yan out to attack the
small number of troops. But this also failed, and he was left all day rubbing
his hands with impatience. Never a man appeared without the wall.
Foiled again, another ruse grew up behind his bushy eyebrows. He set his troops
to cut firewood and seek out and explore the tracks that lay about the city. No
longer did they challenge the wall. After some days of this, Yan Yan began to
wonder what mischief was brewing, and he sent out spies, dressed as were the
firewood cutters, to mingle with them and try to discover what was afoot.
That day, when the troops returned to camp, Zhang Fei sat in his tent stamping
his foot with rage and execrating his enemy.
âThe old fool! Assuredly I shall die of disappointed wrath,â cried he.
Just then he noticed three or four soldiers lurking about his tent door as if
they wished to speak with him.
And one of them said, âGeneral, do not let your heart be hot within you.
These last few days we have discovered a narrow road by which we can sneak past
this city.â
âWhy did you not come and tell me before?â cried he.
âBecause we have only lately discovered it,â said they.
âI will lose no time then,â said he. âThis very night let food be ready
at the second watch, and we will break camp and steal away as silently as
possible. I will lead the way, and you shall go with me as guides.â
The requisite orders were given.
Having made sure that the preparations for the march were really being made,
the spies of the Governor returned into the city.
âI guessed right then,â said Yan Yan gleefully when the spies reported
their success. âI cannot bear the fool. He will now try to sneak past with
his commissariat following, and I will cut off his rear. How can he get
through? He is very stupid to fall thus into my trap. All are to prepare for
battle. The food is to be ready at the second watch, and the army is to move
out at the third. We will hide in the woods and thickets, till the greater part
of the enemyâs army has passed and Zhang Fei has arrived in the very throat
of the road. Then the blow will be struck.â
They waited till night had fallen. In due time the late meal was taken, the
soldiers donned their armor, stole silently out of the city, and hid as they
had been told. The Governor himself. with a few of his generals, went out also,
dismounted and hid in a wood. They waited till after the third watch. Then
Zhang Fei came along, urging his troops to the top of their speed. His spear
lay ready to thrust. He looked very handsome as he rode at the head of his
army. The carts were one or two miles in the rear.
When the soldiers had got well past, Yan Yan gave the signal. The drums rolled
out, up sprang the hidden troops and fell on the baggage train.
The western troops began to plunder. But suddenly a gong clanged and along came
a company of soldiers Yan Yan had not seen.
At the same time a voice was heard shouting, âOld rebel, do not flee! I have
been waiting for this chance a long time!â
Yan Yan turned his head. The leader of this band was a tall man with a leopard-
like bullet head, round eyes, a sharp chin, and bristling tiger mustache. He
was armed with a long serpent halberd and rode a black steed. In a word, it was
Zhang Fei.
All around the gongs were clanging, and many troops of Jingzhou were rushing
toward Yan Yan, already too frightened to be able to defend himself. However,
the two leaders engaged. Very soon Zhang Fei purposely gave his opponent an
opening, and Yan Yan rushed in to cut down his enemy with his sword. But Zhang
Fei evaded the blow, made a sudden rush, seized Yan Yan by the lace of his
armor, and flung him on the ground. Yan Yan was a prisoner, and in a moment was
fast bound with cords.
The handsome leader who had passed first had not been Zhang Fei at all, but
someone dressed and made up to resemble him. To add to the confusion, Zhang Fei
had exchanged the signals, making the gong the signal for his troops to fall on
instead of the usual drum.
As the gongs clanged, more and more of the troops of Jingzhou came into the
fray. The troops of Yizhou could make no fight, and most of them dropped their
weapons and surrendered. To reach the walls of the city was now easy. After
entering the gates, the leader ordered his soldiers not to hurt the people, and
he put out proclamations to pacify the citizens.
By and by a party of executioners brought in the prisoner.
Zhang Fei took his seat in the great hall, and the late commander of the city
was brought before him by a party of executioners. Yan Yan refused to kneel
before his captor.
âWhy did you not surrender at first?â cried Zhang Fei, angrily grinding his
teeth. âHow dared you try to oppose me?â
âBecause you are a lot of unrighteous and lawless invaders!â replied Yan
Yan without the least sign of fear. âYou may behead me as you will, but I
will not surrender to you.â
Zhang Fei angrily gave the order for his execution.
âStrike, if you want to, fool. Why so angry?â said Yan Yan.
This bold defiance was not lost upon Zhang Fei. Rising from his seat, he went
down the steps, put aside the lictors, and began to loosen the prisonerâs
bonds. Then he dressed Yan Yan in new garments and led him to the high place.
When Yan Yan was seated, Zhang Fei made a low bow, saying, âI have always
known you were a hero. Now I pray you not remember against me the roughness of
my speech.â
Yan Yan was overcome with this kindness and forthwith surrendered.
A graybeard ruled in western Shu,
Clear fame is his the whole world through,
As radiant sun his loyalty.
Unmatched his soulâs nobility.
When captive taken rather he
Would suffer death than crook his knee.
Bazhou he ruled for many a year,
The world cannot produce his peer.
A poet has also written concerning Zhang Fei:
Yan Yan made prisoner, then the matchless one
Exchanged the sword for reason, and so won
The place he holds among the sacred ones
Of the west, to whom they sacrifice today.
Then Zhang Fei asked Yan Yan to suggest the means of overcoming the West River
Land.
Yan Yan replied, âI am but the defeated leader of a defeated force, indebted
to the victor for my life. I have nothing but my humble services to offer, but
I can tell you how to get possession of Chengdu without drawing a bow or
shooting an arrow.â
Cities yield in quick succession
Because of one old manâs secession.
The proposal will be unfolded in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 64 ****
As stated in the last chapter, Zhang Fei asked Yan Yan to tell him how he might
conquer the whole of the West River Land.
This was the reply: âAll the fortified posts between this and Luocheng are
under my control, and the commanders of all the garrisons owe to me their
commissions. The only way for me to prove my gratitude is to make them all
yield, as I myself have done. Let me lead the advance, and I will summon them
one by one to surrender.â
Zhang Fei thanked him again and again, and the march on this plan began.
Whenever the army arrived at a post, Yan Yan summoned the commander, and there
it ended. Occasionally, one would hesitate, when Yan Yan would say, âYou see
I have submitted. How much more ought you to do so?â
These bloodless victories followed each other day after day, supporters
rallying to the invaders without question. They simply came.
In the meantime, Zhuge Liang was preparing. Having decided upon the date of
departure, he wrote to inform Liu Bei and made Luocheng the rendezvous for the
various armies. On receipt of this letter, Liu Bei assembled his officers and
explained to them its purport. He bade them be ready to march on the twenty-
second day of the seventh month. Both river and land forces were to set out the
same day.
But the fiery old man Huang Zhong was dissatisfied that there should be no
local victory in the River Fu Pass.
He said, âDay after day the enemy has come to challenge us, and day after day
we have refused. They must have grown lax, and I propose a night raid on their
camp. We shall catch them unprepared and shall score a victory.â
Liu Bei agreed to try. He arranged for a night raid, Huang Zhong on the right,
Wei Yan on the left, and the center force under his own command. They set out
at the second watch and soon arrived. They found Zhang Renâs troops
unprepared, rushed the camp, and set it on fire. The flames were very fierce,
and the troops of Yizhou fled in confusion and sought shelter in Luocheng. They
were admitted. After pursuing them for some distance, Liu Bei made a camp.
Next day Liu Bei marched right up to the city to besiege it. Zhang Ren kept
quiet within and made no attempt to beat off the besiegers. On the fourth day
Liu Bei led an attack on the west gate, sending Huang Zhong and Wei Yan to
attack the east. The north and south gates were left to give the besieged a
chance to escape if they would.
Now, outside the south gate of Luocheng the country was rough and hilly, while
the swift River Fu ran past the north. For this reason the city could not be
surrounded. From the city wall, Zhang Ren watched the progress of the attack
and saw Liu Bei the whole day indefatigably going to and fro directing the
assault. He also saw that as the sun dropped toward the west, the attacking
force showed signs of weariness. Wherefore he sent his two generals, Wu Lan and
Lei Tong, out of the city by the north gate with orders to make their way
around and attack Huang Zhong and Wei Yan. Zhang Ren set himself to go out by
the south gate and steal around to attack Liu Bei. Lest the withdrawal of
troops from the ramparts should discover his plans, he sent the populace up on
the walls to make a show and bade them shout loudly to reinforce the rolling of
the drums.
At sundown Liu Bei ordered the retirement of his army, and the rearmost company
turned about to march back to camp. At this moment arose still louder shouting
from the ramparts, and out at the south gate burst Zhang Ren and his force.
Zhang Ren made straight for Liu Bei, who was in the middle of his army. Liu
Beiâs soldiers were thrown into confusion. As his two generals on the east
side were also attacked, they could render no help, and Liu Bei fled to the
hills. Zhang Ren followed and soon got very near. They were a whole company
pursuing one solitary man, and as Liu Bei plied his whip he felt that the odds
were much against him. Just then he saw another company of soldiers ahead,
emerging from a hill path.
âAn ambush in front; pursuers in rear! Surely Heaven wishes to destroy me!â
cried Liu Bei.
But all was not lost. As they drew nearer, he recognized his own troops, and
the leader who dashed to meet him was his brother Zhang Fei.
Zhang Fei and Yan Yan had happened to take that road, and Zhang Fei had
hastened forward when he saw the dust of conflict.
Zhang Fei and Zhang Ren soon came up with each other, and they fought ten
bouts. By this time Yan Yan with the main body had come up, and Zhang Ren
turned and fled. Zhang Fei followed and chased him as far as the city wall. The
gate was opened to allow Zhang Ren to enter and at once shut. The drawbridge
was raised.
Then Zhang Fei returned to his elder brother to report his arrival and the
incidents of the way.
Hearing that Zhuge Liang had not yet arrived, Zhang Fei rejoiced, saying, âSo
I have the credit of first arrival, although he is traveling by river.â
Liu Bei said, âBut how is it you have come so quickly seeing the precipitous
road you had to travel? Did you meet no opposition?â
Zhang Fei replied, âThe fact is I have taken the forty-five garrisons on the
way by making use of General Yan Yan, whom I captured. It was not my own merit
at all. I have come all the way without the least effort.â
Zhang Fei told the story of Yan Yanâs capture and services from beginning to
end, and then presented the man himself.
Liu Bei said, âGeneral, my brotherâs speedy arrival is certainly owing to
your help.â
Whereupon Liu Bei took off the golden chain mantle he was wearing and gave it
to his new ally.
Orders were given for a banquet.
While it was being prepared, a messenger came to report, saying, âHuang Zhong
and Wei Yan had been fighting with Wu Lan and Lei Tong and had held their own,
till enemy reinforcements led by Wu Yi and Liu Gui arrived. Huang Zhong and Wei
Yan then fled eastward.â
Zhang Fei at once asked his brother to go with him to rescue them. Both went.
When Wu Yi and Liu Gui saw the army of Jingzhou coming, they retired into the
city.
Wu Lan and Lei Tong continued the pursuit. The coming of Liu Bei and Zhang Fei
threatened their rear, and Huang Zhong and Wei Yan turned and recommenced the
battle. Wu Lan and Lei Tong were thus between two fires and helpless. They
offered to surrender and were received. Liu Bei returned to his own camp near
the city.
The loss of his two generals grieved Zhang Ren sorely. He called his remaining
two and asked advice.
Wu Yi and Liu Gui proposed, saying, ï¿½This situation calls for one desperate
battle, where we can hope to repel the enemy. Meanwhile you should send to
Chengdu to tell our master of our current plight.ï¿½
Zhang Ren agreed. Said he, âTomorrow I will go and challenge them. If they
accept and come out to fight, I will feign retreat and inveigle them round to
the north side of the city. As they follow me, a sortie must be made when they
pass the gate so as to cut their army in two. We ought to overcome them in this
way.â
âLet me lead the sortie,â said Wu Yi. âGeneral Liu Gui can stay to help
our lordâs son Liu Xun guard the city.â
This also was agreed to. Next morning Zhang Ren went out to offer the
challenge, his troops waving flags and shouting lustily. At once Zhang Fei took
up the challenge and rode out. He stayed not to parley, but galloped up to
Zhang Ren and engaged him. After about ten bouts Zhang Ren seemed to be getting
worsted, so he turned and fled, taking the way around the north of the city.
Zhang Fei pursued him with all speed. Then as he passed the gate, Wu Yi made a
sortie so that Zhang Fei was between two forces and unable to get clear. Zhang
Ren turned back to attack.
Zhang Fei seemed in a parlous state. But at this very moment a body of soldiers
came up from the riverside and a fierce warrior rode straight for Wu Yi, and in
the first bout made him prisoner; his troops were then forced back, and Zhang
Fei was free. It was Zhao Zilong who had so opportunely appeared.
âWhere is the Directing Instructor?â asked Zhang Fei.
âHe has arrived. I think he has already seen our lord,â replied Zhao
Zilong.
The prisoner was carried to the camp where Zhuge Liang was. Zhang Fei
dismounted and went in to greet him.
Zhuge Liang was surprised, and said, âHow comes it that you arrived before
me?â
Liu Bei told the story of Zhang Feiâs prudence and sagacity in dealing with
Yan Yan.
Zhuge Liang congratulated Zhang Fei and said, âWhen Zhang Fei behaves with
such skill, my lordâs good fortune is indeed ample.â
When the prisoner was taken in, Liu Bei asked him if he would surrender.
Wu Yi replied, âWhy not, seeing I am a prisoner?â
Thereupon Liu Bei himself loosed his bonds. Zhuge Liang began to question him
upon the defense.
Wu Yi told him the names of the officers, saying, âThe son of the Imperial
Protector, Liu Xun, and his generals Liu Gui and Zhang Ren are the defenders.
Liu Gui does not count for much, but Zhang Ren is a man to be avoided.â
âThen before we can get the city, we must capture Zhang Ren,â said Zhuge
Liang. âThere is a bridge on the east. What is it called?â
âIt is known as âGolden Goose Bridgeâ.â
Zhuge Liang rode over to the bridge and scrutinized the neighborhood.
After his return to camp, he summoned Huang Zhong and Wei Yan for orders.
To them he said, âOn the east of the city is a bridge called Golden Goose
Bridge, and about two miles south of this I saw a dense growth of reed and
sedge which would afford excellent shelter. Wei Yan is to lead a thousand
spearmen to the left and attack, but only attack horsemen. Huang Zhong will
lead a thousand swordsmen who are to cut the horses. When Zhang Ren has lost
most of his troops and horses, he will flee by the hill road, where he will
fall into an ambush of Zhang Fei.â
Next Zhao Zilong was called and given order, ï¿½You are to lie in ambush close
to the bridge, which you shall destroy as soon as Zhang Ren has crossed. After
that, you shall take up a position beyond the bridge to prevent him from
getting away to the north. Forced to the south, Zhang Ren will fall into our
hand.ï¿½
These arrangements made, Zhuge Liang himself went to challenge the enemy and
try to bring them to battle.
Imperial Protector Liu Zhang had sent two generals, Zhang Yi and Zhuo Ying, to
reinforce Zhang Ren. Zhang Ren sent Zhang Yi to the help of Liu Gui in the
city, while Zhuo Ying was to march second with Zhang Ren himself to encounter
the enemy.
Zhuge Liang led across the bridge a mob of disorderly looking soldiers, all in
disarray, whom he drew up as if they were a fighting force. He himself, dressed
in a simple robe and toying with a fan, took his seat in a small four-wheeled
carriage. A few horsemen caracoling gaily to and fro formed his escort.
Having crossed the bridge, Zhuge Liang halted and pointed to Zhang Ren, saying,
âDare you withstand me and not surrender when Cao Caoâs million troops fled
at my name?â
But the enemy leader was rather occupied with inspecting the disorderly lot of
soldiers he saw in front, all standing anyhow and not drawn up into formation
at all.
With a cynical smile, Zhang Ren said, âPeople talk of Zhuge Liangâs
superhuman military genius. I say his reputation is false!â
With that Zhang Ren whirled his spear about his head, and he dashed forward
with all his troops. As he came, Zhuge Liang left his carriage, mounted a
horse, and retired to the far side of the bridge. Zhang Ren impetuously pursued
and rushed over the Golden Goose Bridge. It was only when he had reached the
other side that he saw a body of soldiers on either hand. Then he knew that he
had been led into a trap.
As soon as he had got across the bridge, the two bodies of soldiers under Liu
Bei and Yan Yan came to the attack. Zhang Ren turned to get back to the bridge,
but Zhao Zilong had done his work and the bridge was in ruins. Zhang Ren made
to turn sway north, but Zhao Zilongâs troops stopped the way so he had to
turn southward and followed the course of the river. He presently reached the
place where grew the reeds and sedges. Out came Wei Yan and his company of
spearmen, who stabbed at the horsemen fiercely while Huang Zhong, with his
swordsmen, cut down the horses. Soldiers and horses were soon lying on the
ground. The few survivors were quickly made prisoners and bound with cords.
No footman escaped. But a few lucky horsemen followed Zhang Ren and got away to
the hills. There they met Zhang Fei, who fell upon them with a mighty roar,
scattered the few followers, and captured the leader. Seeing Zhang Ren a
prisoner, his second in command Zhuo Ying turned toward Zhao Zilong and
surrendered. Victorious, they returned to camp. Liu Bei rewarded Zhuo Ying.
When the leader Zhang Ren was led in by Zhang Fei, Zhuge Liang was seated
beside his lord.
âWhy have you held out so long after all the other generals of Yizhou have
yielded?â said Liu Bei.
âCan a loyal servant take a second master?â cried Zhang Ren fiercely, his
eyes glaring with hate.
âYou do not know the times. Submission means life.â
âI might submit today, but it would not endure. I should repent it. You had
better slay me.â
Liu Bei was inclined to mercy, but the prisoner was irreconcilable and kept up
a stream of furious abuse. So at last the order was given for his execution,
thus giving him a right to fame.
A poem says:
No second lord the heroic servant knows,
The way of death Zhang Ren contented goes.
Clear shines his fame as doth the heavenly moon
That nightly lights the ramparts of Luocheng Town.
Liu Bei grieved for Zhang Ren, although Zhang Ren had been an enemy, for he was
a brave man. Zhang Ren was given honorable burial, sepulture beside the Golden
Goose Bridge, where all the passers-by would be reminded of his loyalty.
Next day the army moved on to Luocheng, Yan Yan and the other generals who had
submitted leading the way.
At the gate they hailed the defenders, ï¿½Open the gates and surrender, whereby
the city should be saved from utter destruction!ï¿½
From the wall, Liu Gui abused the treacherous Yan Yan and took his bow to
shoot. But just as Liu Gui was fitting the arrow to the string, another man cut
him down. Soon the gates were thrown open and the city had yielded.
As Liu Bei entered the city by one gate, Liu Xun, who had shared the command of
the city, escaped by another gate and set off for Chengdu.
Liu Bei put forth proclamations to allay the fears of the inhabitants of the
city. He inquired who had been on his side in cutting down Liu Gui and was told
it was Zhang Yi of Wuyang. Zhang Yi and all who had helped in the capture were
amply rewarded.
âOur next city is Chengdu,â said Zhuge Liang. âHowever, in the meantime
there may be some trouble in pacifying the outlying counties, and hence it will
be well for you to send Zhang Fei and Zhao Zilong with Wu Yi, Zhang Yi, Yan
Yan, and Zhuo Ying leading the way, into the country along the river and
Changyang, Deyang, and Baxi to reassure the people and to repress any rising
that may take place. There will be no need for any especial precautions in the
neighborhood of Chengdu.â
The warriors went their ways, and then Zhuge Liang began to make careful
inquiries concerning the road to Chengdu.
Those who had given in their allegiance to the invaders said, âThe only place
where you can expect any serious defense is Mianzhu. Once you have passed this,
the capital lies at your mercy.â
Then Fa Zheng was consulted.
Said he, âWith the fall of Luocheng, the West River Land passed to you. Let
our lord only deal with the people kindly and justly, and there will be no need
of weapons. I can write such a letter to Imperial Protector Liu Zhang as shall
make him surrender at call.â
âThat would be most excellent,â said Zhuge Liang.
The letter was written and sent by the hand of a messenger.
Liu Xun, son of the Imperial Protector, presently reached Chengdu and told his
father of the loss of Luocheng. The Imperial Protector at once called his
counselors together.
Adviser Zheng Du said, âAlthough Liu Bei has been successful and captured
cities and towns, yet his army is but small, his hosts are not near him, and he
depends upon chance for his grain and has no proper supplies. Therefore our
best plan is to remove the people of Baxi and Zitong to the farther side of
River Fu, burn all the granaries, fortify the city, and let starvation defeat
him. Let us reject all challenges to battle, and in a hundred days his troops
will go off of their own accord. Then we can do with him as we will.â
âI like not the plan,â said Liu Zhang. âOppose invaders in order that
tranquillity may prevail is a well-worn maxim, but till now I have never heard
of disturbing the people in order to oppose the march of an enemy. Your words
are not such as safety.â
Just at the moment the letter from Fa Zheng arrived. It was opened and the
Imperial Protector read:
âI was sent to Jingzhou to negotiate an alliance, but the opposition of those
about you to their lord has resulted in the present situation. However, the
ruler of Jingzhou still remembers old friendship and is mindful of the ties of
relationship. If you, my master, could reverse your policy and lend your
support to your relative, I think you would be generously treated. I hope you
will consider this carefully.â
Liu Zhang flew into a passion. He tore the letter to fragments and began to
abuse its writer, crying, âThat traitor, ingrate, and renegade! How dares he
talk thus to me?â
And Liu Zhang drove the bearer of the letter from his presence. He then sent an
army under the leadership of Fei Guan, his wifeâs brother, to reinforce
Mianzhu.
Fei Guan at once recommended as his assistant one Li Yan of Nanyang, and the
two mustered their troops, thirty thousand, and set out for the city.
At this juncture Dong He, the Governor of Yizhou City, wrote advising to borrow
aid from Hanzhong.
But Liu Zhang rejected this plan, saying, âIt will be useless to try to
obtain help from a region under the influence of our relentless enemy Zhang
Lu.â
Dong He replied, âHe may be an enemy, but Liu Bei is in possession of
Luocheng, and the situation is extremely dangerous. When the lips are gone, the
teeth are cold. If you clearly indicate the dangers to him, he must come to our
help.â
So a letter was written and sent to Hanzhong.
Two years had elapsed since Ma Chao had been defeated and gone over to the
Qiang tribes in the northwest. He had made friends with them and with their aid
had conquered portions of the West Valley Land. His expeditions had been very
successful, the people opening their gates at the first summons. Only Jicheng
had stood out, but ever this was on the point of yielding. The Governor of
Jicheng, Wei Kang, had sent many urgent appeals for help to Xiahou Yuan in
Changan, who, however, would do nothing without his masterâs order. Wei Kang
was in despair, and at a council his officers advised him to yield.
However, one of them, Yang Fu, earnestly opposed yielding, saying, âWe cannot
surrender to a lot of rebels such as Ma Chao and his colleagues.â
âWhat is there to hope for?â asked Wei Kang despairingly.
Although Yang Fu besought Wei Kang with bitterness to hold out, it was useless.
Wei Kang rejected his advice, opened the city gates, and bowed his head in
submission.
âYou only yield now as the last resource,â cried Ma Chao, angry at the
delay he had suffered. âThis is no real submission.â
Whereupon he put to death Wei Kang and all his family to the number of two
score.
But when they told Ma Chao that Yang Fu had been really responsible for the
long delay, in that Yang Fu had urged his master to hold out, Ma Chao did not
put him to death but praised him and said, âYang Fu had but done his duty.â
Ma Chao further showed his approval by employing Yang Fu and two of his friends
in his own army. These two friends were named Liang Kuan and Zhao Qu.
One day Yang Fu went to his new chief and said, âMy wife has died in Lintao.
I wish to take leave for two months to bury her.â
Wherefore Yang Fu was granted leave and went away from the army. On the way, he
went to his maternal cousin, General Jiang Xu, Commander of Licheng. The
generalâs mother, then an old lady of eighty-two was Yang Fuâs aunt.
When Yang Fu saw her, he wept before her, saying, âBehold an unfortunate man!
The city I had to defend is lost; my master is dead; and I have survived him. I
am ashamed to look you in the face. Now this Ma Chao ravages the countryside,
and everyone hates him. Yet my cousin sits still and does nothing against Ma
Chao. Is this fitting conduct for a state servant?â
Yang Fu wept bitterly.
The old lady was moved by his grief, called in her son and said to him
reproachfully, âYou are the cause of the evil that has come upon the noble
Wei Kang.â
Then turning once more toward Yang Fu, she said, âBut what can now be done?
You have surrendered and, more than that, you have accepted service under your
late enemy.â
âIt is true,â replied Yang Fu. âI have surrendered and I have accepted
service, but it is with the desire to preserve my miserable life till I can
avenge my master.â
âMa Chao is bold and difficult to destroy,â said Jiang Xu.
âNot very difficult,â replied Yang Fu, âfor though he is bold, yet he is
unskillful. Already I have two friends Liang Kuan and Zhao Qu by his side, and
they would help against him if you, my brother, would only supply a force.â
âWhat is to be gained by delay?â then said the old lady. âIs there anyone
who will not have to die? To perish in the way of loyalty and righteousness is
to die in the right path. Do not think of me, for if you do, and heed not the
call of your cousin, then will I die at once so that you may be free to make up
your mind.â
There was now no excuse for delay, and Jiang Xu had to act. He summoned two of
his officers, Yin Feng and Zhao Ang, and took counsel with them.
Now Zhao Ang had a son, Zhao Yue, who was an officer in the army of Ma Chao.
When Zhao Ang had to consent to take part against his sonâs chief, he became
very unhappy and went home to talk over it with his wife, Lady Wang.
He said, âI have today been led into a scheme to destroy Ma Chao and avenge
Wei Kang. But there is our son there in Ma Chaoâs service, and Ma Chao will
certainly put our son to death as soon as he hears that we are arming against
him. What is to be done?â
But his wife replied angrily, âShould anyone grudge even his life to avenge
his liege lord or his father? How much less a son? My lord, if you let the
thought of your son stay your hand, then will I die forthwith.â
This decided the matter, and without further parley Zhao Ang decided to share
the expedition and set about preparations. The army was soon on the way. Jiang
Xu and Yang Fu camped at the city of Licheng; Zhao Ang and Yin Feng camped at
Qishan. The wife of Zhao Ang sold her ornaments and went in person to her
husbandâs camp to feast his soldiers.
The fears of Zhao Ang concerning the fate of his son were only too soon
justified. At the first news of the march of an army against him, Ma Chao
beheaded the young Zhao Yue. Then Ma Chao marched his force, together with Pang
De and Ma Dai, to Licheng, and the troops under Jiang Xu and Yang Fu went out
to oppose it. The two leaders on the avenging side went to battle dressed in
mourning white.
They railed at Ma Chao, crying, âWicked traitor! Rebel!â
Ma Chao angrily dashed across toward them, and the fight began. From the very
first it was seen that the defenders of the city could not hope to beat off the
attack, and they turned to flee. Ma Chao pursued them. But soon he heard the
shouting of soldiers behind him and found the other army led by Zhao Ang and
Yin Feng was attacking his rear. Wherefore he was between two armies and had a
double battle to fight. As he turned toward that in his rear, Jiang Xu and Yang
Fu returned again to the attack. And while engaged with these two, there
suddenly appeared a third force under Xiahou Yuan, who had just received orders
from Cao Cao to come against Ma Chao.
Three attacks at once were too much for Ma Chao, and he fled, his force in
utter confusion. He retreated all that night and at dawn reached his own city
of Jicheng. He hailed the gate, but a flight of arrows was the response. Soon
after, Liang Kuan and Zhao Qu appeared and reviled him from the ramparts above.
More than this, they dragged his wife, Lady Yang, up upon the wall, hacked her
before his face, and threw the bloody body at his feet. They followed up this
by the murder in like manner of his three sons and other members of his family
to the number of ten and more. And all their dead bodies were flung from the
wall.
Rage and despair filled Ma Chaoâs bosom; he almost fell from his steed. But
little time was allowed to grieve, for Xiahou Yuan was nearly upon him. Knowing
that he could not oppose this force with any chance of victory, he made no
battle line, but set off with two of his generals, Ma Dai and Pang De, to cut
his way through such parties of the enemy as they might meet. Their sole object
was escape, so when they fell upon Yang Fu and Jiang Xu, they only fought to
get through, and in the same way they cut an alley through the army under Yin
Feng and Zhao Ang. However, they lost most of their few followers, and at the
end had only some sixty horsemen left.
About the fourth watch they came to Licheng. In the darkness, the gate guards,
thinking only of the return of their own troops, opened the gates and
unwittingly let in the enemy. Once in the city Ma Chao and his followers began
the slaughter, and everyone, soldier or common person, was slain, till the city
was swept clear from the south gate to the very center.
Presently they came to the residence of Jiang Xu and dragged forth his aged
mother. She showed no sign of fear, but reviled Ma Chao till in his anger he
slew her with his own sword. Thence they went to the house of Yin Feng and Zhao
Ang and slew all they found therein. The only person who escaped the massacre
was Lady Wang, wife of Zhao Ang, who had accompanied her husband.
But the city proved no place of safety. Xiahou Yuan with his army appeared the
following day, and Ma Chao fled before him to the west. But ere he had gone
seven miles, he came face to face with another army drawn up in battle array.
Yang Fu was the leader.
Grinding his teeth with rage, Ma Chao set his spear and rode at Yang Fu, while
his two generals, Ma Dai and Pang De, attacked the rear. Yang Fu was overcome,
and his seven brothers who had gone with him into the battle were slain. Yang
Fu himself was wounded in five places, but still fought on till he was wounded
down.
However, Xiahou Yuan had not left pursuing Ma Chao. He came up to the city, and
Ma Chao fled. His army was now reduced to the two generals and about five or
six of horsemen, and these few were left to go their way.
Cao Caoâs general, Xiahou Yuan, set himself to restore order and tranquillity
in the region of Xizhou, after which he apportioned its defense among Jiang Xu
and other trustworthy commanders. The wounded leader Yang Fu was sent to the
capital in a carriage. When he arrived Xuchang, he saw Cao Cao who offered him
the title of Lordship.
But Yang Fu declined the honor, saying, âI have neither the credit of a
successful defense nor the merit of death with my master. Death should be my
portion rather than honors. How could I accept the offer?â
Cao Cao praised him and insisted on granting the lordship.
Having escaped from their pursuers, Ma Chao and his few followers decided to
make for Hanzhong and offer their services to Governor Zhang Lu. Zhang Lu
received them gladly, for he thought with such help he could certainly get
possession of Yizhou on the west as well as repel Cao Cao on the east. More
than this, he thought to cement the friendship by giving Ma Chao a daughter to
wife. But this displeased one of Zhang Luâs generals, Yang Bo.
âThe misfortune that befell Ma Chaoâs wife and family was entirely the
fault of his own misconduct. Would you give your daughter to such as he to
wife?â said Yang Bo.
Zhang Lu again considered the matter and abandoned his intention. But a certain
busybody told Ma Chao what had been proposed and that Yang Bo had defeated the
scheme. Whereupon Ma Chao was very annoyed and sought to compass the death of
Yang Bo. Yang Bo and his brother, Yang Song, on the other side conspired to
destroy Ma Chao.
At this time a messenger from Liu Zhang of Yizhou arrived in Hanzhong begging
for assistance against the invader Liu Bei. Zhang Lu refused help. But then
Huang Quan came on the same errand. He first saw Yang Song and talked to him
and brought him to favor the scheme.
Huang Quan said, âThe East and West River Lands, which stand next each other
as the lips are close to the teeth, are interdependent. If Yizhou is lost,
Hanzhong has little chance to survive. On the other hand, once relieved by your
help, Imperial Protector Liu Zhang will reward twenty counties to Hanzhong as
compensation.â
So Huang Quan won over Yang Song, who led him to see his master. To Zhang Lu
again Huang Quan spoke forcibly and laid the matter before him so cogently that
Zhang Lu promised his help.
But Yan Pu, one of Zhang Luâs officers, tried to dissuade him, saying,
ï¿½This plead for help and offering of twenty counties are only their temporary
tactics. Liu Zhang and you are old enemies. His promise is not to be
trusted.ï¿½
And another suddenly interjected, saying, âUseless I may be, but if you will
give me troops, I will capture this Liu Bei and you will retain all your
land.â
The landâs true lord goes west and then
Hanzhong sends forth its bravest men.
Who made this bold offer? The next chapter will tell.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 65 ****
Then Ma Chao rose and said, âI have been the recipient of much kindness from
my lord, which I feel I can never repay adequately. Now let me lead an army to
take Jiameng Pass and capture Liu Bei. Then, my lord, Liu Zhang will surely
lose his twenty counties, and they shall be yours.â
This offer rejoiced Zhang Lu, who sent away Huang Quan with a promise to help.
Then Zhang Lu told off twenty thousand for Ma Chao to lead. Pang De was too ill
to take part in the expedition, so he remained in Hanzhong. Zhang Lu ordered
Yang Bo to be Army Supervisor. Ma Chao and Ma Dai chose a day to march to
Jiameng Pass.
Meanwhile, the messenger sent to Chengdu by Fa Zheng had returned to Luocheng
to report: âZheng Du advised Liu Zhang to set fire to all the plains and
valleys between the capital and the invaders, as well as the granaries, to move
sway the people, and to stand solely on the defensive.â
This news caused Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang great anxiety, for it would be a grave
danger to them. However, Fa Zheng was more sanguine.
âDo not be anxious,â said he, âthe plan would be extremely harmful, but
it will not be carried out. Liu Zhang will not do that.â
Surely enough, very soon they heard that Liu Zhang had not adopted the
suggestion; he would not remove the people. It was a great relief to Liu Bei
Then said Zhuge Liang, âNow let us capture Mianzhu quickly, for, that done,
Chengdu is as good as ours.â
Liu Bei therefore told off Huang Zhong and Wei Yan to advance first. When
Commander of Mianzhu, Fei Guan, heard of their advance, he ordered Li Yan to go
out to stop them, and Li Yan led out three thousand troops. The two sides being
arrayed, Huang Zhong rode out and fought some half hundred bouts with Li Yan.
Neither was able to claim a victory, and so Zhuge Liang from the midst of the
host ordered them to beat the gongs to cease from battle.
When Huang Zhong had got back to his side again, he said, âO Instructor, why
did you sound the retirement just as I was getting the better of my
opponent?â
âBecause I saw that Li Yan was not to be overcome by mere force. Tomorrow you
shall fight again, and then you shall lead him into the hills by the ruse of
pretended defeat. There will be a surprise awaiting him.â
Huang Zhong agreed to try this plan, and so on the morrow accepted Li Yanâs
challenge when it was offered. After about the tenth bout, Huang Zhong and his
troops pretended to be worsted and ran. Li Yan pursued and was quickly lured
into the mountains. Suddenly his danger flashed into his mind, and he turned to
go back.
But he found Wei Yanâs troops drawn up across his path.
From a hill top near by, Zhuge Liang cried, âYou had better yield! If not,
there are bows and crossbows on both sides of you â-all ready to avenge the
death of our Pang Tong.â
Li Yan dropped off his horse, threw aside his armor, and offered submission.
Not a soldier of his had been hurt. The prisoner was conducted to Liu Bei, who
was very affable and so won Li Yanâs heart that Li Yan offered to try to
seduce Fei Guan from his allegiance.
âThough he is related to Liu Zhang, yet Fei Guan and I are very close
friends. Let me go and persuade him.â
Wherefore Li Yan was sent back to the city to induce his chief to come over to
Liu Beiâs side. Li Yan talked to such effect of the kindness and virtues of
Liu Bei that Fei Guan was won over, opened the city gates, and admitted the
invaders.
As soon as Liu Bei had entered Mianzhu, he set out his forces to take the
capital.
While thus engaged, a hasty messenger came to tell of the doings at Jiameng
Pass: âThere suddenly appeared an army from the east under Ma Chao, Ma Dai,
and Yang Bo. They are attacking, and the Pass will certainly be lost if help is
not sent quickly.â
âWe need both Zhang Fei and Zhao Zilong for this,â remarked Zhuge Liang.
âThen we could oppose successfully.â
âBut Zhao Zilong is away,â said Liu Bei. âHowever, Zhang Fei is here. Let
us send him quickly.â
âDo not say anything, my lord,â said Zhuge Liang. âLet me stir him to
fight his noblest.â
But as soon as Zhang Fei heard of the danger, he came rushing in, shouting,
âI must say farewell, brother! I am off to fight Ma Chao.â
However, Zhuge Liang made as if he heard not and said to Liu Bei, âThat Ma
Chao has invaded Jiameng Pass, and we have no one to drive him back. Nobody can
stand up to him, unless we can get Guan Yu from Jingzhou. Guan Yu could do
it.â
âWhy do you despise me, O Instructor?â cried Zhang Fei. âDid I not once
drive back a whole army with my mere voice? Think you that I mind a stupid fool
like Ma Chao?â
Zhuge Liang said, âYes, General; but when you forced back the waters and
broke the bridge in the Long Slope, you succeeded because your enemies were
doubtful. If they had known, you would not have come off so easily. Now, all
the world knows this Ma Chao and has heard about his six battles at River Wei;
and how he made Cao Cao cut off his beard and throw away his robe. Ma Chao very
nearly slew Cao Cao too. This is no lightsome task like that, and even Guan Yu
might fail.â
âAll I care for is to go, and if I do not overcome this fellow, I will take
the consequences.â
âWell, if you will put that in writing, you may lead the attack. And I will
ask our lord to lead another army to back you up this time. He can leave the
defense of this town to me till Zhao Zilong returns.â
âI also want to go,â said Wei Yan.
Wei Yan was allowed to go with five hundred of light horse in advance of Zhang
Fei. Liu Bei marched third. Wei Yan and his scouts soon arrived at Jiameng Pass
and there fell in with Yang Bo. They engaged; but after a few bouts Yang Bo
fled.
At this success Wei Yan was seized with ambition to rival it and try to snatch
the credit that would fall to Zhang Fei. So he pursued. But he presently came
across a line of battle all drawn up, the commander being Ma Dai. Wei Yan,
thinking it was the redoubtable Ma Chao, rode toward him whirling his sword.
Soon Ma Dai turned and ran away, and Wei Yan followed him. However, Ma Dai
presently turned back and shot an arrow, which wounded Wei Yan in the left arm,
so that he left the pursuit and turned his face the other way. Then Ma Dai came
after him and chased Wei Yan nearly up to the Pass.
Here Ma Dai was suddenly confronted by a fierce thunder-roaring leader who
dashed down from the Pass as on a flying steed.
It was Zhang Fei, who had just arrived. Hearing the noise of battle below the
Pass, Zhang Fei had come to learn what it meant and saw the arrow wound of Wei
Yan. Soon Zhang Fei was in the saddle and off to the rescue. But before he
engaged, he would ascertain if the foe was worthy of his steel.
âWho are you? Tell your name,â cried Zhang Fei, âthen I may fight with
you.â
âI am Ma Dai of Xiliang.â
âAs you are not Ma Chao, go away quickly, for you are no match for me. You
may bid Ma Chao himself come, and tell him that Zhang Fei of Yan is here.â
âHow dare you treat me with contempt?â cried Ma Dai in hot anger, and he
came galloping up with his spear set ready to thrust. But after a half score
bouts he fled.
Zhang Fei was about to pursue when a rider came up to him hastily, crying,
âDo not pursue, my brother.â
The rider was Liu Bei, and Zhang Fei stopped. The two returned together to the
Pass.
âI knew your impulsive temper, and so I followed you. Since you have got the
better of him, you may well rest and recuperate for the fight tomorrow with Ma
Chao.â
The rolling of drums at dawn next day declared the arrival of Ma Chao. Liu Bei
looked at the array from a point of vantage and saw Ma Chao emerge from the
shadow of his great standard. Ma Chao wore a lion helmet, and his belt was
clasped with the shaggy head of a wild beast. His breastplate was silver and
his robe of white. As his dress and bearing were so extraordinary, so were his
abilities superior. And Liu Bei looked at him, sighing admiringly.
âHe justifies what people say,â said Liu Bei, âHandsome Ma Chao.â
Zhang Fei was for going down at once, but his brother once more checked him,
saying, âNo, not yet. Avoid the first keenness of his fighting ardor.â
Thus below was Ma Chao challenging Zhang Fei, while, above, Zhang Fei was
fretting at being unable to settle Ma Chao. Time after time Zhang Fei was
setting out, but each time his brother checked him. And so it continued till
past midday, when Liu Bei, noticing signs of fatigue and weariness among Ma
Chaoâs army, decided that it was time to let Zhang Fei try his fortune.
Whereupon Liu Bei chose out five hundred horsemen to accompany his brother and
let the party go.
Ma Chao seeing Zhang Fei coming with so small a force, signaled with his spear
to his array to retire a bowshot, and Zhang Feiâs troops halted. When all his
troops had taken their places, Zhang Fei set serpent halberd and rode out.
âDo you know who I am?â shouted Zhang Fei. âI am Zhang Fei of Yan!â
Ma Chao replied, âMy family having been noble for many generations. I am not
likely to know any rustic dolts!â
This reply upset Zhang Fei, and in a moment the two steeds were rushing toward
each other, both men with poised spears. The fight began and continued for a
hundred bouts. Neither had the advantage.
âA veritable tiger of a leader,â sighed Liu Bei.
But Liu Bei felt that Zhang Fei was running a risk, wherefore he sounded the
gong as a signal to cease the fight. And each drew off to his own side. Zhang
Fei rested his steed for a time, then, leaving his helmet, he wound a turban
about his head, mounted, and rode out to renew the fight. Ma Chao also came
out, and the duel continued.
Presently Liu Bei thought his brother in danger. So he girded on his armor and
went down into the plain. He watched till they had fought another hundred
bouts, and then as both seemed to wax fiercer than ever, he gave the signal
again to cease the battle. Both drew off and returned each to his own side.
It was then getting late, and Liu Bei said to his brother, âYou had better
retire for today. He is a terrible opponent. Try him again tomorrow.â
But Zhang Feiâs spirit was roused, and it was unlikely that such advice would
be palatable.
âNo,â shouted he, âI will die and not come back!â
âBut it is late. You cannot go on fighting,â said Liu Bei.
âLet them bring torches, and we will have a night battle,â said Zhang Fei.
Ma Chao having mounted a fresh steed, now rode out and shouted, âDare you try
a night battle, Zhang Fei?â
Zhang Feiâs excitement rose higher. He hastily changed horses with his
brother and rode forth.
âIf I do not capture you, I will not go back to the Pass,â said Zhang Fei.
âAnd if I do not overcome you, I will not return to the camp,â said Ma
Chao.
Both sides cheered. They lit many thousand torches till it seemed as light as
day, and the two great generals went to the front to fight. At the twentieth
bout Ma Chao turned his steed and tied.
âWhither are you going?â called out Zhang Fei.
The fact was that Ma Chao had begun to see he could not win in direct and
simple combat, so he thought to try a ruse. By a false flight, as though he
knew he had lost, he would inveigle Zhang Fei into pursuit. He picked up a
copper mace secretly and kept a careful watch on his opponent for the most
favorable moment to strike. But Ma Chaoâs flight only put Zhang Fei upon his
guard, and when the moment came for the blow with the mace he dodged, so that
the weapon flew harmlessly past his ear. Then Zhang Fei turned his horse.
Whereupon Ma Chao began to pursue. Then Zhang Fei pulled up, took his bow,
fitted an arrow to the string, and let fly at Ma Chao. But Ma Chao also dodged,
and the arrow flew by. Then each returned to his own side.
Then Liu Bei came out to the front of his battle line and called out, âNote
well, O Ma Chao, that I, who have never treated people other than with kindness
and justice and truth and sincerity, swear that I will not take advantage of
your period of repose to pursue or attack. Wherefore you may rest awhile in
peace.â
Ma Chao, hearing these words, withdrew guarding the rear, and the other
generals one by one returned, while Liu Bei drew off his army toward the Pass.
Early next day Zhang Fei was once more going down out of the Pass to fight,
when they told him that the Directing Instructor had arrived. Liu Bei went to
receive him, and Zhuge Liang at once began to speak of Ma Chao.
âHe is the most terrible leader of the age. If he fights a desperate battle
with Zhang Fei, loss of a general will ensue. So I have come as quickly as I
could. I left Mianzhu in the safe hands of Zhao Zilong and Huang Zhong. I think
I have a little ruse left that will bring Ma Chao over to our side.â
âNow I have seen the man. I greatly admire him,â said Liu Bei. âIf we
could only win him over!â
âThen listen, my lord,â said Zhuge Liang. âZhang Lu greatly desires the
title of âPrince of Hanzhong.â Among his most intimate subordinates, I know
Yang Song open to bribery. So we will send a person secretly to see him and
give him gold and silver and so win his support. This done, we will write to
Zhang Lu and tell him that you are set upon taking Yizhou from its present
ruler, which will give an opportunity to wipe out the enmity he has so long
nourished against Liu Zhang, and that the reward of his remaining firmly on our
side to the end will be that you will memorialize the Throne for the coveted
title for him. This will make him order Ma Chao to return, and, when that is
done, I shall find a means of winning him over.â
Liu Bei wrote a letter and sent it by the hand of Sun Qian together with gold
and pearls. Sun Qian went by secret roads to give these to Yang Song. And when
he found Yang Song and explained his mission in private, he was quickly led
into the presence of Zhang Lu.
âHow can Liu Bei memorialize the Throne to confer on me the rank of a prince
when he is but a simple General himself?â asked Zhang Lu, when he understood
the offer and its conditions.
âHe is an Imperial Uncle,â said Yang Song. âWith such a rank he could
present such a memorial.â
Zhang Lu assented. He sent orders to Ma Chao to cease fighting, and Sun Qian
remained as the guest of Yang Song till he should see whether Ma Chao would
obey the command. Before long the messenger returned with a word from Ma Chao
that he could not cease fighting till he had been successful. A second and
third messenger returned with a similar response.
âThis Ma Chao is untrustworthy,â said Yang Song. âHe will not withdraw
his soldiers because he contemplates rebellion. That is the real reason.â
Yang Song set stories afloat rumoring: âMa Chao desires to make himself the
ruler of the west and has said that he will no longer be content with
subordinate rank. And he means to avenge the death of his father.â
The rumors came to the ear of Zhang Lu, and he asked Yang Song what should be
done.
Yang Song proposed, saying, âGive Ma Chao a limit of a month in order to
accomplish his task, provided he consents to three conditions. And if he does
not agree, he will have to be put to death. The three conditions are the
capture of West River Land, the head of Liu Zhang, and the repulse of the
Jingzhou troops. If he fails in anyone of these, just bring his head.
Meanwhile, Zhang Wei should be sent as guard at one of the strategic points
which will control Ma Chaoâs army in case of rebellion.â
When Ma Chao heard the three demands made on him, he was greatly troubled,
saying, âWhat can such a charge mean?â
After taking counsel with Ma Dai, it seemed best to suspend fighting, and the
army returned.
But Yang Song had not yet attained his end, so he said to Zhang Lu, âMa
Chaoâs return with an army will be a danger, and hence all the points of
vantage on the homeward road must be guarded so that to stop him.â
Thus Ma Chao was helpless and could see no way out of the difficulty.
Then Zhuge Liang said to his lord, âNow is my chance to use my little three
inches of unworn tongue. Ma Chao is in a fix. I am going to his camp to
persuade him to come over to your side.â
âBut I do not like you to run such a risk, Instructor. You are my most
necessary support, and if anything happened to you, what should I do?â
Zhuge Liang was set upon going and persisted in his request. Liu Bei again and
again refused. At this juncture a messenger came with letters from Zhao Zilong.
Liu Bei called him in and questioned him. He was Li Hui of Jianning, the man
who had formerly remonstrated so earnestly with Liu Zhang.
âYou once pleaded with your master to keep me out. Why are you here now?â
âBecause the prudent bird chooses its perch, and the wise person his master.
I did attempt to dissuade Liu Zhang of Yizhou from a course which I felt to be
disastrous, and thereby fulfilled my duty as his servant. He rejected my
counsel, and I knew he would fail. Your liberality, O General, has won over all
the region, and success must be yours. I wish to serve under your banner.â
âYour services will surely be of great advantage to me, Sir,â said Liu Bei.
Then Li Hui began to talk of Ma Chao, âI knew him when we were in West Valley
Land together. He is now in great straits, and I may be able to talk him over.
What say you?â
âJust the man to go instead of me,â interjected Zhuge Liang. âBut what
arguments will you use?â
Li Hui leaned over and whispered in his ear thus and thus. What he said seemed
to please Zhuge Liang mightily, and he was bidden to go forthwith.
Arrived at the camp, Li Hui sent in his name, at which Ma Chao remarked,
âYes, I know him â-a glib and specious persuader. I know what he has come
for, too.â
So Ma Chao placed a score of armed ruffians in hiding about his tent and told
them to cut the visitor to pieces if the signal was given.
Then the guest was led in and came walking proudly. His host remained seated
stiff and upright.
Ma Chao spoke roughly, saying, âWhat are you come for?â
âI am here as persuader.â
âThis sword here in the scabbard is newly ground. You may try me by words,
but if the words do not penetrate, I shall ask you to try the sword.â
Li Hui smiled, saying, âO General, evil is not far off. However, I am
thinking the newly ground sword will not be tried on my head. You will want to
try it on your own!â
âWhat evil were you talking about?â
âThe worst vilification could not hide the beauty of Lady Xi Shi of Yue, nor
could the most fulsome praise gloze over the ugliness of Lady Wuyan of Qi. The
sun rises to the meridian and then declines; the moon waxes to the full and
then wanes. All things obey the one law. Now, General, you are at enmity with
Cao Cao for your fatherâs death, and in West Valley Land you carry a
stubborn, grinding hate for your familyâs death. You can neither rescue Liu
Zhang by repulsing the army from Jingzhou, nor can you settle Yang Song by
getting an interview with Zhang Lu. The whole world now holds no place for a
person without a lord; and if you experience further defeats, like that one on
River Wei, or the loss of Jicheng, will you not be too shamed to look any human
in the face?â
Ma Chao bowed his head, saying, âYou speak well, Sir. But I am helpless.â
âNow that you listen to me, I would ask why those fearsome ruffians are in
hiding by your tent?â continued Li Hui.
Ma Chao, suddenly stricken with shame, ordered them to retire. Li Hui continued
his speech.
âLiu Bei, the Imperial Uncle, is considerate to his subordinates, and I am
certain he will succeed, and so I have forsaken Liu Zhang to cleave to him.
Your honored father joined him in destroying rebels. Why do you not flee from
darkness into the light? Thereby you would avenge your father and become
famous.â
Ma Chao, convinced of the wisdom of the course thus recommended, proved his
conversion by sending for Yang Bo and slaying him forthwith. Taking with him
the head of his victim, Ma Chao accompanied Li Hui to the Pass and tendered his
submission. Liu Bei welcomed him warmly and treated him as a highly honored
guest.
Ma Chao bowed his head, saying, âMeeting you, O Illustrious Lord, is like
seeing the clear sky when the clouds have been swept aside.â
When Sun Qian returned from Yang Songâs place, Liu Bei detached a force to go
to the capture of Chengdu, left two generals, Meng Da and Huo Jun to guard
Jiameng Pass, and made a triumphant entry into Mianzhu with the welcome of Zhao
Zilong and Huang Zhong.
Two generals of West River Land, Ma Han and Liu Jun, came to oppose Liu Bei,
but Zhao Zilong went out against them while Liu Bei was entertaining Ma Chao at
a banquet on the city wall. Ere it had concluded, Zhao Zilong slew both the
generals and brought their heads to the banquet chamber. This exploit put Ma
Chao on his mettle and doubled his respect for the conquerors.
âLet not my lord attack,â said Ma Chao. âI will make Liu Zhang surrender
of his own accord. Should he resist, my brother Ma Dai and I will take the city
and offer it to you with both hands.â
Liu Bei was very pleased with the course of events. The day was indeed one of
rejoicing.
But Liu Zhang was greatly distressed at the news of his fresh misfortunes,
which reached him with the return of his defeated soldiers. He barred the gates
and stopped all exits. Before long came news of the approach of Ma Chao with an
army of rescue. The Imperial Protector then ventured to mount the walls, and
soon Ma Chao and Ma Dai rode up and stood below the ramparts.
And Ma Chao called out, âI wish to speak with Liu Zhang.â
Then Liu Zhang showed himself, and Ma Chao plunged into the matter without more
ado.
âI took the leadership of Zhang Luâs army to rescue Yizhou, little thinking
that, under the calumnious advice of Yang Song, Zhang Lu would try to slay me.
However, now I have gone over to the side of Liu Bei, the Imperial Uncle, and
advise you, Sir, to do the same, you and all your officers. Thereby you will
all escape harm. If anyone holds on a misguided course, I shall take the
city.â
Such words came as a shock, and Liu Zhang paled. His feelings overcame him and
he swooned.
When he came to his senses, he muttered, âI am stupid and I am sorry. Better
open the gates and end it. The city will be saved.â
âNo, no,â cried Dong He. âThere are thirty thousand of good soldiers in
the city and ample money and stores for a year to come. Hold out!â
But Liu Zhang was broken, saying, âMy father and I have ruled Shu for twenty
years and have done no particular good for the people. We have fought for three
years: The grass has been be stained with the blood of my people. The fault is
mine. I could not bear it, and so I see no better way than to surrender,
whereby I may bring peace to the people.â
Those about him wept. One man spoke, saying, âYou speak as Heaven guides
you.â
Turning toward him they recognized a man of Baxi named Qiao Zhou, who had the
reputation of being an astrologer.
âI have studied the aspect of the heavens and a multitude of stars gathered
over the west, one of which shone as the full moon: A right royal star. And I
recall a popular couplet of last year:
âWhen comes the ruler from the east,
Then may you on new rice feast.
âNone can withstand the decree of the Most High.â
Liu Ba and Huang Quan, who heard these words, were very angry at such a speech
and rose up, swords in hand, to smite the speaker. But Liu Zhang stayed them.
Next came news that Xu Jing, the Governor of the Shu District, had climbed the
wall and gone over to the invaders. This was the last blow. Liu Zhang went home
weeping.
Next day they reported that Liu Bei, the Imperial Uncle, had sent Jian Yong as
legate to visit Liu Zhang and he was even then at the city gate. Jian Yong was
admitted, and he entered, riding in a carriage and looking about him most
haughtily.
Suddenly he was hailed from the street by a man with a sword in his hand, who
cried, âYou have got your wish, wretched creature, and you seem to think
there is no one to compare with you. But do not look so contemptuously at us of
Shu!â
Jian Yong quickly got out of his carriage to speak to the speaker, who was a
man of Mianzhu named Qin Mi.
âWorthy brother,â said Jian Yong, âI did not recognize you. I pray you
not to be angry.â
Both then went to visit Liu Zhang, and they spoke of the liberality and broad-
mindedness of Liu Bei, said he had no intention to harm anyone, and praised him
to such effect that Liu Zhang then and there made up his mind finally that he
would give up the struggle. So he treated Jian Yong very honorably that day.
And the next day, taking his seal and insignia of office and his archives, he
accompanied Jian Yong out of the city and went to Liu Beiâs camp. Liu Bei
came out in person to receive him.
Taking Liu Zhang by the hand, Liu Bei wept, saying, âIt is not that I wish to
act cruelly or wrongly. I am the victim of circumstances and cannot help it.â
They entered the camp together, where the seal of office and the documents
changed hands. Afterwards they rode into the city side by side. The people gave
Liu Bei a cordial welcome, burning incense and illuminating the city. The
victor went to the residence of the chief of the region, where he took his seat
and was saluted by all the subordinate officials.
However, Huang Quan and Liu Ba stayed away from the ceremony. This annoyed the
more violent of Liu Beiâs supporters, and they wished to kill the
delinquents. But Liu Bei would not allow violence and threatened condign
punishment to anyone who might interfere with these two. When the reception was
over, Liu Bei went to visit the two recalcitrants, whereupon both came out and
made their obeisance.
Said Zhuge Liang to Liu Bei, âWe have vanquished, and all opposition in
Yizhou is at an end. But there cannot be two rulers, so you must remove Liu
Zhang to Jingzhou.â
âBut I do not wish to exile him,â said Liu Bei.
âHe lost his prestige through weakness. If you are weak and undecided, you
also will not last long.â
Liu Bei saw his advice was good, and so he gave a great banquet whereat he
begged Liu Zhang to pack up his treasures and prepare to move. He gave the
dispossessed Imperial Protector the title General Who Spreads Prestige. Liu
Zhang went away to Gongan in Jingzhou, taking with him his family and all his
possessions.
Liu Bei thus became Imperial Protector of Yizhou. He conferred gifts on the
civil and military officers who joined him, confirming their ranks and titles.
Yan Yan was made General of the Front Army; Fa Zheng, Governor of the Shu
District; Dong He and Xu Jing, Imperial Commanders; Liu Ba, General of the Left
Army; Huang Quan, General of the Right Army; Wu Yi, Fei Guan, Peng Yang, Zhuo
Ying, Li Yan, Wu Lan, Lei Tong, Li Hui, Zhang Yi, Qin Mi, Qiao Zhou, Lu Yin,
Huo Jun, Deng Zhi, Yang Hong, Zhou Qun, Fei Yi, Fei Shi, Meng Da, and others of
Shu officers whose aid had been conspicuous were given high ranks and finer
titles under the new rule, and the total of more than sixty of them were well
rewarded.
Naturally, honors were distributed freely to Liu Beiâs immediate helpers, to
whose efforts he owed his position. Zhuge Liang was held Directing Instructor;
Guan Yu, General Who Destroys Rebels and Lord of Hanshou; Zhang Fei, General
Who Subdues Rebels and Lord of Xin; Zhao Zilong, General Who Guards the West;
Huang Zhong, General Who Conquers the West; Wei Yan, General Who Wages
Successful War; Ma Chao, General Who Pacifies the West. Sun Qian, Jian Yong, Mi
Zhu, Mi Fang, Ma Liang, Ma Su, Jiang Wan, Yi Ji, Liu Feng, Guan Ping, Liao Hua,
Zhou Cang, and others, many of whom had come to Liu Bei from Jingzhou, received
promotions and rewards.
In addition, a special gift of five hundred ounces of gold, a thousand ounces
of silver, much copper money, and a thousand rolls of Xichuan silk, was sent to
Guan Yu. And all the military and civil officers were given appointments and
rewards. Huge numbers of oxen and horses were slaughtered for banquets to the
army, and the contents of the granaries were given to the common people. So
that there were great rejoicings.
Yizhou being settled, Liu Bei next desired to confiscate the lands of the more
famous of the inhabitants about Capital Chengdu and divide them among his
officers.
But here Zhao Zilong and others dissuaded him, saying, âThe sufferings of the
people have been severe and losses great. It would be wise policy to let them
settle down to their occupations as soon as possible. It would be wrong to
reward our own people at the expense of these people.â
Liu Bei listened and gave in with good grace.
To Zhuge Liang, Liu Bei assigned the revision of the laws, in which the
punishments to be made, on the whole, heavy.
Then Fa Zheng spoke up, âThe founder of Han, Liu Bang, drew up three chapters
of law, and the people were all profoundly affected by his virtue. I would
rather that the laws be few and liberal that people may be comforted.â
Zhuge Liang replied, âYou only look at one side. The laws of Qin were
fiercely cruel and provoked resentment among the people. It was fitting that
the Supreme Ancestor should temper them with kindness. Under the weak
administration of Liu Zhang, there has never been an efficient government, and
there is a lack of respect for the law. The proper relationship between ruler
and minister has been gradually obscured. Favor has been the means of rising,
and the highest in rank have been the basest. Kindness has been extended into
license, and the most benefited have been the most contemptuous. And thereby
have crept in many evils. Now I mean to inculcate respect for the dignity of
the law, and kindness shall follow its attainment: There shall be moderation in
conferring rank, but honor shall really follow on such promotion. In the mutual
cooperation of kindness and honor and in proper distinction between superiors
and inferiors lies the efficiency of a government.â
Fa Zheng had no argument to oppose. In due time all became perfectly tranquil,
and all the forty-one counties, with their respective garrisons, were peaceful
and contented.
As Governor of the Shu District, Fa Zheng earned much hatred, busying himself
in returning favors and avenging past deeds however small they were. One person
told of the complaints to Zhuge Liang, urging his reproof.
But Zhuge Liang referred to his meritorious services, saying, âWhen our lord
was in Jingzhou, fearful of Cao Cao on the north and trembling lest he be
attacked from the east by Sun Quan, it was Fa Zheng who supported him, gave him
directions, and added wings to him so that he could soar this high. In these
prosperous days one can hardly begin to discipline Fa Zheng. Could we
reasonably forbid him following somewhat his own way?â
So no investigation was made, but Fa Zheng heard of the complaints and
corrected his faults.
One day, when Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang were resting and at leisure, Guan Ping
arrived with a letter from his father, thanking his elder brother for the
handsome gifts.
Making obeisance and handing in his letter, Guan Ping said, âMy father was
anxious to come into Yizhou to try conclusions with Ma Chao.â
Said Liu Bei, âIf he were to come and fight, I fear they would not both
survive.â
âThere is nothing to be anxious about,â said Zhuge Liang. âI will write
to Guan Yu.â
Liu Bei feared that his brotherâs impulsive temperament might lead to
trouble, so he told Zhuge Liang to compose a letter and send back by Guan Ping.
When Guan Ping came again to his father, the first question was: âDid you
mention the contest with Ma Chao?â
Then the letter was produced, and this is what it said:
âI hear you are anxious to decide whether of the twain, Ma Chao or yourself,
is the better man. Now I can measure Ma Chao. He may be unusually brave and
bold, but he is only of the class of Ying Bu and Peng Yue of old. He might be a
worthy rival of your younger brother, but he is far from the standard set by
you, O Lord of the Beautiful Beard. You have a most important charge. If you
come into the West River Land, and Jingzhou should be lost, would you not be
guilty of a terrible failure? I think you will see this.â
Guan Yu stroked his long beard and smiled as he read the letter.
âThe Instructor knows me thoroughly,â said he to himself.
He showed the letter to his clients and friends and thought no more of going
westward.
The successes of Liu Bei in the west had been duly noted by Sun Quan, who
thought he was surely now going to obtain the much-coveted Jingzhou. So he
called in Zhang Zhao and Gu Yong to ask advice.
Sun Quan said, âWhen Liu Bei occupied Jingzhou temporarily, he pledged he
would return the region to the South Land when he would possess Yizhou. Now he
has taken the forty-one counties of West River Land. If Jingzhou is not
returned, I will take it by force.â
Zhang Zhao said, âI have already a scheme that will need no fighting. Liu Bei
will offer the place to you with both hands.â
In Shu there shine new sun and moon,
Wu dreams Jingzhou will be his soon.
We shall see in the next chapter the scheme to recover the much-desired region.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 66 ****
The scheme, which Zhang Zhao had in mind, he laid before his master thus:
âThe one man upon whom Liu Bei relies most is Zhuge Liang. Now his brother is
in your service and in your power. All you have to do is to seize Zhuge Jinâs
family and send him west to see Zhuge Liang and make Zhuge Liang persuade Liu
Bei to return Jingzhou. If Liu Bei refuses, the family of Zhuge Jin will
suffer, and Zhuge Liang will not be able to resist the claims of
brotherhood.â
âBut Zhuge Jin is a loyal and true gentleman. I could not lay hands upon his
family!â said Sun Quan.
âExplain the ruse to him. That will set his mind at rest,â said Zhang Zhao.
Sun Quan consented and issued the command to confine the family of his retainer
in the palace but not really imprison them. Then he wrote a letter for Zhuge
Jin to take with him on his mission. Before many days Zhuge Jin reached Chengdu
and sent to inform Liu Bei of his arrival.
Liu Bei at once sought the advice of Zhuge Liang.
âWhy think you your brother has come?â
âHe has come to force the return of Jingzhou.â
âHow shall I answer him?â
âYou must do so and so,â said Zhuge Liang.
The plan of action being prepared, Zhuge Liang went out of the city to welcome
his brother. But instead of taking him to his own residence, Zhuge Liang took
him to the guest-house. When the greetings were over, the visitor suddenly
lifted up his voice and wept.
âIf you have any trouble, my brother, pray tell. Why do you weep thus?â
asked Zhuge Liang.
âAlas! My family are lost!â cried he.
âI suppose it is in the matter of the return of Jingzhou? If your family have
been seized on my account, how can I bear it calmly? But do not be anxious, my
brother. I shall certainly find some way out of the difficulty.â
This reply pleased Zhuge Jin, and the two brothers went to visit Liu Bei.
The letter of Sun Quan was presented, but when Liu Bei had read it he said,
angrily, âHe is related to me by marriage, and he has profited by my absence
from Jingzhou to steal away his sister. That is a sort of kindliness I find it
hard to bear. When I am just going to lead my army to the South Land to take
vengeance, is it likely he will get Jingzhou out of me?â
At this point Zhuge Liang prostrated himself weeping at his lordâs feet and
said, âThe Marquis of Wu has seized my brotherâs family, and he will put
them all to death if the land be not given up. Can I remain alive if such a
fate befall them? I pray my lord for my sake to give back the region and
prevent any breach between my brother and me.â
But Liu Bei refused. He seemed obdurate, but Zhuge Liang persisted in his
entreaty. Finally Liu Bei reluctantly consented.
âSince things are so, and the Instructor pleads for it, I will return
half,â said he. âI will give up three territories â-Changsha, Lingling,
and Guiyang.â
âThen, as you have consented, prepare letters ordering Guan Yu to yield these
three territories,â said Zhuge Jin.
Liu Bei said, âWhen you see my brother, you must use most gracious words to
him, for his nature is as a fierce fire, and even I fear what he may do. So be
very careful.â
Zhuge Jin, having got the letter, took his leave and went straightway to
Jingzhou. He asked for an interview, and was received in the grand reception
hall.
When both were seated in their respective places, the emissary produced the
letter of Liu Bei, saying, âThe Imperial Uncle has promised to return three
territories to my master, and I hope, General, you will hand them over at once
and let me return.â
Guan Yuâs countenance changed, and he said, âThe oath sworn in the Peach
Garden bound me and my brother to support the dynasty of Han. Jingzhou is a
portion of their domain, and how can any part be given to another? When a
leader is in the field, he receives no orders, not even those of his prince.
Although you have brought letters from my brother, yet will I not yield the
territories.â
âBut the Marquis of Wu has laid hands upon my family, and they will be slain
if the land be not given up. I crave your pity, O General!â
âThis is but a ruse on his part, but it does not deceive me!â
âWhy are you so pitiless?â
Guan Yu drew his sword, saying, âLet us have no more. This sword is
pitiless!â
âIt will put the Instructor to shame,â said Guan Ping. âI pray you not to
be angry, my father.â
âWere it not for my respect for the Instructor, you would never go back to
the South Land,â said Guan Yu to Zhuge Jin.
Zhuge Jin, overwhelmed with shame, took his leave, sought his ship, and hastily
returned to Chengdu to see his brother. But Zhuge Liang had gone away upon a
journey. However, he saw Liu Bei and related what had happened, and said that
Guan Yu was going to slay him.
âMy brother is hasty,â said Liu Bei. âIt is difficult to argue with him.
But return home for the present, and when I have finished my conquest of
Hanzhong, I will transfer Guan Yu to another post, and then I may be able to
return Jingzhou.â
Zhuge Jin had no choice but to accept this reply and carry the unsatisfactory
news to his master.
Sun Quan was greatly annoyed and said, âThis running to and fro was nothing
more than one of your brotherâs tricks.â
The unhappy messenger denied, saying, âNo, no! Zhuge Liang had interceded
with many tears and obtained the promise to return three territories from Liu
Bei. It was the obstinacy of Guan Yu that spoiled all.â
âSince Liu Bei said he would return three territories, we may send officials
to take over their administration. Think you that might be done?â said Sun
Quan.
âWhat you say, my lord, seems most proper.â
The family of Zhuge Jin were restored to liberty, and officers were sent to
take charge of the three territories of Changsha, Lingling, and Guiyang.
But they quickly returned, saying, âGuan Yu would have none of us, but had
chased us away at once with threats to kill us if we did not hasten!â
Sun Quan then summoned Lu Su and laid the blame on him.
âYou are Liu Beiâs guarantor in this matter. How can you sit quietly
looking on while Liu Bei fails to perform his contract?â said Sun Quan.
âI have thought out a plan and was just going to impart it to you,â said Lu
Su.
âAnd what is your plan?â
Lu Su said, âThere is a camp at Lukou. Invite Guan Yu to a banquet there and
try to persuade him. If he still remains obstinate, have some assassins ready
to slay him. Should he refuses the banquet, then we must try conclusions with
an army.â
âThis suits me,â said Sun Quan, âand it shall be done.â
âIt should not be done!â interrupted Kan Ze. âThe man is as bold as a
tiger and not at all like common humans. The plan will fail and result in more
harm.â
âThen when may I expect to get my Jingzhou?â asked Sun Quan, angrily.
Sun Quan ordered Lu Su to carry out his plan, and Lu Su went to Lukou forthwith
and settled the preliminaries of the banquet with Lu Meng and Gan Ning. The
place selected was by the river. Then Lu Su wrote a letter and found a
persuasive person to deliver it. The messenger set out and sailed across the
river to the post, where he was received by Guan Ping, who conducted him to his
father.
âAs Lu Su invites me, I will come tomorrow. You may return,â was Guan
Yuâs reply.
After the messenger had gone, Guan Ping said to his father, âWhy did you
promise to go? I think Lu Su means you no good.â
âDo you think I do not know? This has all come out of my refusal to yield
those three territories. They are going to try coercion at this banquet. If I
refuse, they will think I fear them. I will go tomorrow in a small ship with
just my ten personal guards, and we shall see whether Lu Su will dare to come
near me.â
âBut, Father, why risk your priceless self in the very den of a tiger? I
think you are not giving due importance to my uncleâs charge.â
âI have been in the midst of million blades and arrows, yet I have been
riding through it like traveling through a meadow of no one. Think you that I
shall begin to show fear of a few such rats as those?â
Nor was the son alone in remonstrance. Ma Liang also warned his chief.
âAlthough Lu Su has a great repute, yet now he is pushed hard. He certainly
is badly disposed toward you, and you must be careful, General.â
Guan Yu replied, âI have given my word, and shall I withdraw from it? In the
days of the Warring States, Lin Xiangru of the state of Zhao had not the force
even to bind a chicken, yet in the assembly at Shengchi Lake he regarded not
the prince and the ministers of the powerful state of Qin, but did his duty
without fear of consequences. Have I not learned to face any number of foes? I
cannot break my promise.â
âIf you must go,â said Ma Liang, âat least go prepared.â
âTell my son to choose out ten fast ships and five hundred of good marines
and be in readiness to help me at need. And when he sees a red flag waved, he
can come over to my aid.â
The order was given, and the little squadron was got ready.
The messenger returned to his master and told him that Guan Yu had boldly
accepted the invitation, and Lu Su and Lu Meng took counsel together.
âWhat do you think of this?â asked Lu Su.
âIf Guan Yu comes with a force, Gan Ning and I will be in readiness for him
by the riverside. And you will hear our bomb as a signal that we are attacking.
If he has no force with him, the assassins can set on during the banquet.â
Next day a look-out was kept on the bank, and early in the day a single ship
came along. It was manned by very few men, and a simple red flag flew out on
the breeze showing but one word, Guan. Presently they could see him, a handsome
figure in a green robe and navy-blue turban. Beside him stood Zhou Cang, his
sword-bearer, and near him were eight or nine fine-looking men, each with a
sword at his side.
Guan Yu landed and was received by the trembling Lu Su, who conducted him to
the hall, bowed his greetings, and led him to the banquet chamber. When Guan Yu
drank to his host, Lu Su dared not raise his eyes, but Guan Yu was perfectly
composed.
When they had become mellow with wine, Lu Su said, âI have a word to say to
you, Sir, if haply I may have your attention. You know that your illustrious
brother, the Imperial Uncle, made me surety with my master that Jingzhou would
be returned after Yizhou had been taken. Well, now that country is in his
possession, but Jingzhou is still unreturned. Is not this a breach of good
faith?â
âThis is a government affair,â said Guan Yu. âSuch matters should not be
introduced at a banquet.â
âMy master only has petty possessions in the east, and he allowed the
temporary loan of Jingzhou out of consideration for the need in which you then
were. But now you have Yizhou, and Jingzhou should be given up. The Imperial
Uncle has even yielded three territories, but you, Sir, seem unwilling to let
them go. This seems hard to explain on reasonable grounds.â
Guan Yu replied, âAfter the Red Cliffs, my brother braved the arrows and the
stones in the battle at Wuling and with all his strength drove back the enemy.
Did he get a single foot of land for all his efforts? Now you come to force
this place out of him.â
âNo, I do not,â said Lu Su. âBut at the time that you and your brother
suffered defeat at Dangyang, when you were helpless and in the greatest
straits, fugitives you knew not whither, then my master was moved with pity and
did not grudge the land. So he gave your brother a foothold whence he might be
able to accomplish other ends. But your brother has presumed upon long-
suffering. He has attained his end â-the country of his desire â-and still
he occupies Jingzhou. Such greed and such treachery will make the whole world
laugh him to shame, as you know quite well.â
âAll that is no affair of mine; it is my brotherâs . I cannot yield the
land.â
âI know that by the oath in the Peach Garden you three were to live or die
together. But your brother has consented to yield: How are you going to get out
of that?â
Before Guan Yu could reply, however, Zhou Cang burst into the conversation,
roaring out, âOnly the virtuous get hold of territory: Does that mean only
you people of East Wu?â
Guan Yuâs anger now showed itself. His face changed; he rose in his place,
took his sword from his sword-bearer, and said fiercely, âHow dare you talk
like this at a discussion of state matters? Go! And go quickly!â
Zhou Cang understood. He left the hall, made his way to the river and waved the
red call-flag. The ships of Guan Ping darted across like arrows and were ready
for action.
The mighty sword in his right hand, Guan Yu laid hold of Lu Su with his left
and, simulating intoxication, said, âYou have kindly invited me today, Sir,
but do not say anything about Jingzhou, for I am so drunk that I may forget our
old friendship. Some other day I hope to invite you to Jingzhou, and then we
will talk about that matter.â
Poor Lu Suâs soul almost left his body with fright as he was led down to the
river bank in the grip of his guest. Lu Meng and Gan Ning, who Lu Su had placed
in ambush, dared not act and so made no move lest they should bring about the
doom of Lu Su. When they got to the bank, Guan Yu released his host, got on
board, and then said farewell. Lu Su stood dumbfounded, staring at the ship,
while a fair breeze bore it quickly out of sight.
This episode has been commemorated in verse:
He showed his contempt for the soldiers of Wu
By going alone to their traitor feast;
As Lin Xiangru of old he was much bolder;
As the Shengchi Lake game was played again.
Guan Yu took his homeward way, while Lu Su and his two confederates talked over
what had occurred.
âWhat can be done now?â said Lu Su.
âThe only thing is to tell our master and let him send an army,â replied Lu
Meng.
Lu Su sent a messenger to Sun Quan, who, in his wrath, was for sending every
available soldier at once against Jingzhou.
But at this crisis there came news that Cao Cao was raising a huge army with
the intention of attacking the South Land. So hasty orders were sent to Lu Su
to make no move, but to send all the troops he could toward Hefei and Ruxu in
the north to repel Cao Cao.
However, Cao Cao did not march south. One of his military advisers, Fu Gan,
sent in a memorial against the scheme:
âI, Fu Gan, understand that inspiring fear is the chief consideration in war,
as inculcating virtue is in government. These two combined in one person fit
him to be a prince. Formerly, in the days of disturbance, you, Illustrious Sir,
attacked the rebels and restored tranquillity almost everywhere, the only
regions unsubdued and not under your control being Wu and Shu. The former of
these is protected by the Great River, the latter secured by its mountains, and
both difficult to conquer by force of arms.
ï¿½My humble opinion is that it is more fitting to increase the authority of
civil government, to lay aside arms and rest weapons, to cease from war and
train your soldiers until the times shall be favorable. If your mighty legions
be now sent to camp on the river bank and the rebels should take refuge behind
their natural defenses, your soldiers will be unable to prove their prowess;
and should extraordinary strategies be planned, the rebels will not be
available. In such a case your high prestige would be impaired. I trust,
Illustrious Sir, you will deign to examine this.â
After reading this, Cao Cao ceased to think of an expedition against the south.
Instead, he established schools and set himself to attract people of ability.
About the same time four of his officers â-Wang Can, Du Xi, Wei Kai, and He
He â-conceived the idea of getting for Cao Cao the honor of âPrince of
Weiâ.
But Xun You opposed this course, saying, âThe Prime Ministerâs rank is
already that of âDukeâ, and he has received the additional honor of the
Nine Dignities, so that his position is extremely high. If he advances to the
rank of kingship, it will be inconsistent with reasonableness.â
But Cao Cao was annoyed at this opposition and said, âDoes the man wish to
emulate Xun Yu?â
When Xun You heard of Cao Caoâs anger, he was grieved and fell ill, so that
in a few days he died. He was fifty-eight years of age. Cao Cao had his remains
interred honorably, and he stayed his ambition for princely rank.
But there came a day when Cao Cao entered the Palace wearing his sword and made
his way to the apartment where the Emperor and the Empress were seated. The
Empress rose in a fright, and the Emperor gazed at his minister in terror.
âSun Quan and Liu Bei have each seized a portion of the empire and no longer
respect the court. What is to be done?â
To this abrupt speech the Emperor replied, âThe matter lies within your
province.â
Cao Cao answered, angrily, âIf such a remark be known outside, they will say
I treat my prince without respect!â
âIf you will help me, I shall be most happy,â said His Majesty. âIf not,
then I trust to your kindness to let me alone.â
At this Cao Cao glared at the Emperor and went out full of resentment.
The courtiers said, âIt is said that the Duke of Wei desires to become Prince
of Wei, and soon he will aspire to the throne.â
Both the Emperor and his consort wept.
Presently Her Majesty said, âMy father, Fu Wan, has long nourished a desire
to slay this man. Now I will indite a secret letter to my father to accomplish
his end.â
âRemember the former attempt with Dong Cheng. The plot was discovered and
great misery ensued. I fear that this will leak out also, and both of us will
be undone.â
Said the Empress, âWe pass our days in constant discomfort, like sitting on a
rug full of needles. If life is to be like this, one were better dead. But I
know one loyal man among the attendants to whom I may entrust the letter. That
one is Mu Shun, and he will deliver it.â
Thereupon Empress Fu summoned Mu Shun within, and having sent away all others,
they told their distress to the faithful one.
Emperor Xian said, âThat fellow Cao Cao desires the dignity of a prince, and
soon he will aspire to the throne itself. I, the Emperor, wish to order the
father of my consort to make away with the man, but the difficulty is that all
the courtiers are his creatures and there is none whom I can trust save
yourself. I desire you to convey this secret letter to Fu Wan. I know your
loyalty and am sure you will prove no betrayer.â
âI am the recipient of much graciousness for which not even death would prove
my gratitude. Thy servant prays that he may be allowed to undertake this.â
The letter was given to Mu Shun, who hid it in his hair, made his way out of
the precincts and handed it to its owner. Fu Wan recognized the handwriting of
his daughter and read it.
Turning to the messenger, Fu Wan said, âYou know the fellowâs creatures are
many, and one must act with extreme caution against him. Unless we have the aid
of Sun Quanâs and Liu Beiâs armies, Cao Cao will certainly attain his ends.
In this matter we must gain the support of every loyal and faithful one in the
court so that within and without there may be a simultaneous attack.â
âThen, O Father of the Empress, write a letter in reply asking for a secret
edict, so that we may send to the south and the west to join in the attack.â
So Fu Wan composed a reply, which he gave to Mu Shun to take into the Palace.
This time also the letter was concealed in his hair.
But there was a traitor, and Cao Cao heard of the letters. So he waited at a
Palace gate for Mu Shun to come out.
âWhere are you going?â asked Cao Cao, when Mu Shun appeared.
âThe Empress is indisposed and has bidden me call a physician.â
âWhere is the summon for the physician?â
âThere is no summon.â
Cao Cao bade his guards search Mu Shun, but they did not find the letter.
So he was allowed to go. But just then a gust of wind blew off his hat, and it
struck Cao Cao that that had not been examined. So Mu Shun was called back.
Nothing was found in the hat, but when it was given back Mu Shun put it on with
both hands. There was something suspicious about the movement, and Cao Cao bade
the searchers examine his hair.
Therein the letter of Fu Wan was found. Cao Cao read it, which said that Sun
Quan and Liu Bei were to be induced to help. The unhappy Mu Shun was taken away
into a secret place and interrogated, but he would confess nothing.
That night three thousand soldiers surrounded the dwelling of Fu Wan, who was
arrested with all his family. Searching the house, they found the first letter
in the handwriting of the Empress. Fu Wan and his family were then consigned to
a gaol.
At dawn, a party of Imperial Guards, under Chi Lu, bearing ensigns of
authority, entered the Forbidden City with orders to take away the seal of the
Empress. On the way they met the Emperor, who asked the reason for a company of
armed guards being in the Palace.
âI have orders from the Duke of Wei to get the Empressâs seal,â said Chi
Lu.
The Emperor grew alarmed. When Chi Lu reached the apartments of the Empress,
she had just risen. Chi Lu ordered to take the seal of the Empress and went
away.
As soon as the Empress knew of this, she recognized her danger and hid herself
in the hollow walls of her private apartments behind one of the ceremonial
halls. She had not been long in hiding when Hua Xin with a company of five
hundred armed soldiers appeared and asked where she was. The Palace people said
they did not know. The red doors of the hall were burst open, and Hua Xin
looked in, but he saw no lady there. It occurred to him where she might be
hidden, and he ordered his men to break open the wall. With his own hands, he
laid hold of the ladyâs hair and dragged her forth.
âSpare my life!â pleaded she.
âYou may say what you have to say to the Duke!â cried he.
She pulled down her hair and kicked off her shoes, but a couple of soldiers
pushed her along in front of them outside.
It may be said here that this Hua Xin had a reputation for learning. He and two
others, Bing Yuan and Guan Ning, all good friends, made a little coterie which
was known as âThe Dragonâ. Hua Xin was the âheadâ; Bing Yuan, the
âbellyâ; and Guan Ning, the âtailâ. One day Guan Ning and Hua Xin were
hoeing in their garden to grow some vegetables, when they turned up an ingot of
gold. Guan Ning went on with his labors without giving a second glance at the
find, but Hua Xin picked it up. After regarding it a moment, he threw it away
again.
Another day Guan Ning and Hua Xin were reading together when there arose a
great shouting outside the window of the study. A minister from the Palace was
passing. Guan Ning took no notice, but kept his eyes on his book; Hua Xin rose
and went to the window. For this, Guan Ning despised his companion and the two
parted for good.
Sometime after, in the disturbance of the empire, Guan Ning fled into Liaodong,
where he led the life of hermit. He wore a white cap and lived in the upper
part of a house, never touching the ground with his feet. He would have nothing
to do with Cao Cao and would not enter his service.
But Hua Xin led a totally different life. For a time he was with Sun Quan; then
he went over to Cao Cao and served him. And here he is found actually laying
hands upon the Empress.
His conduct in this particular is the subject of a poem:
That was a dastardly thing that Hua Xin did,
When he broke don the wall where the Empress hid
And dragged her forth by the hair.
He lent his aid to a foul, foul crime
And execrations throughout all time,
Have been, and shall be, his share.
A poet also wrote concerning Guan Ning:
East of Liaodong, so stories tell
Is Guan Ningâs tower, where long he dwelt.
Ignoble wealth was Hua Xinâs quest,
The hermitâs simple life was best.
As Hua Xin hurried the unhappy woman out of the hall, the Emperor saw her. He
went over and clasped her to his bosom, weeping.
Hua Xin tried to force her onward, saying, âThe Duke of Wei ordered no
delay!â
âMy doom is sealed,â wept the Empress.
âAnd I know not when my turn will come,â sighed the Emperor.
The soldiers hustled the Empress onward, leaving His Majesty beating his breast
in despair.
âCan it be that such things happen in the world?â cried the Emperor to Chi
Lu, who stood by.
And the Emperor swooned. Chi Lu made the courtiers pick him up, and they bore
him into the Palace.
Meanwhile, the unhappy Empress had been taken before Cao Cao.
âI have dealt well with you,â said he angrily, âand you requited me by
plotting my murder. It is the death of one of us, I see.â
He ordered the executioners to beat her till she died. After this, he went into
the Palace, seized her two sons and had them poisoned. In the evening of the
same day the whole households of Mu Shun and Fu Wan were put to death publicly.
Such terrible deeds spread terror everywhere. They happened in the eleventh
month of the nineteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 214).
As Cao Cao stands first in cruelty,
So stands Fu Wan in loyalty.
A married pair of low estate,
Had not been torn apart by fate.
The Emperor grieved bitterly over the loss of his consort, and in his despair
refused all food. Cao Cao did not wish him to die of starvation and loneliness,
so he proposed his own daughter as consort.
âBe not sad,â said Cao Cao. âThy servant is no rebel. My daughter is
already in your palace as a secondary lady. She is wise and dutiful, fit to be
your consort and occupy the first rank.â
Emperor Xian dared not refuse, and therefore at the new year (AD 215), in the
time of the festivities, Lady Caoâs name was inscribed on the dynastic rolls
as Empress. And no one of the courtiers dared protest.
Wherefore Cao Cao became even more powerful. But it pleased him not to have
rivals in the land, so he again thought of subduing Liu Bei and Sun Quan.
Jia Xu proposed, saying, âXiahou Dun and Cao Ren, who are serving on the
frontiers, should be called to give their advice.â
They were sent for, and Cao Ren was the first to arrive. As a relative, he felt
he had the right to see the great minister without delay and went directly to
the palace.
But it happened that Cao Cao had been drinking heavily, and his faithful
henchman, Xu Chu, would not admit the new arrival.
âI am of the family,â said Cao Ren, angry at the hindrance. âDare you
stop me?â
âGeneral, you may be a relative, but here you are but an officer from the
frontier. I am of little account, but a duty lies on me here in the palace. Our
lord is overcome with wine and asleep, and I dare not allow you to enter.â
The refusal came to Cao Caoâs knowledge, and he commended the loyalty of Xu
Chu.
Soon after, Xiahou Dun came and was called to the council.
Xiahou Dun gave his opinion, saying, âThe two rivals should be left until
Zhang Lu of Hanzhong has been subdued. The great army that can overcome Zhang
Lu will be in condition to attack the West River Land, and it will be conquered
without difficulty.â
The advice coincided with Cao Caoâs own idea, and so he prepared an
expedition for the west.
By a crime he showed his power over a feeble king;
This done, at once he hastened to destroy his neighbor.
What happened will be told in later chapters.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 67 ****
Yuan and Zhang He were Leaders of the Van; Cao Cao with his commanders marched
in the center; and Cao Ren brought up the rear. Xiahou Dun was in charge of the
commissariat.
The spies soon carried the news into Hanzhong, and Zhang Lu called in his
brother Zhang Wei to consult how to meet the attack.
Said Zhang Wei, âThe strategic point to hold is Yangping Pass, and there
should be ten stockades there with the forest and hills to support them. You,
my brother, should make your depot of supplies at Hanning.â
Thereupon two generals, Yang Ang and Yan Ren, were sent with Zhang Wei to the
Pass, and they built ten stockades.
Soon Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He arrived and learned the Pass had prepared a
defense. They camped at a point five miles away. The soldiers were fatigued
after the long march, and all lay down to rest without placing proper guards.
Suddenly the camp was attacked in the rear by Yang Ang and Yan Ren from
different points. Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He mounted quickly and tried to beat
off the attackers, but the enemy poured in all round, and their army suffered
great loss. They returned to the main body to tell of their defeat, and their
chief abused them for their want of care.
âOld soldiers like you should have known better and taken precautions against
a raid of the camp when the enemy knew your troops were exhausted by a long
march.â
Cao Cao even desired to put them to death as a warning, but their fellow
officers interceded, and he spared them. Soon Cao Cao himself marched in the
van. Then he saw the dangerous and evil nature of the place, with its thick
growth of trees. As he knew nothing of the roads and was fearful of an ambush,
he returned to his camp.
Calling up his two leaders, Xu Chu and Xu Huang, he said, âHad I known the
dangerous nature of the place, I would never have come.â
Xu Chu replied, âThe soldiers are here now, my lord, and you cannot recoil
before the hardships.â
Next day Cao Cao with only Xu Chu and Xu Huang rode out to reconnoiter the
enemyâs camp.
As they rode over the hills, Cao Cao pointed out the position with his whip and
said, âIt will be very difficult to reduce a place as strong as this.â
Just then there arose a shout in their rear, and a shower of arrows fell about
them. Yang Ang and Yan Ren were attacking, and the danger became great.
âFriend Xu Huang, you look after our lord!â cried Xu Chu. âI can hold the
enemy.â
Xu Chu galloped out, and the two leaders could not stand Xu Chu and took to
flight, while their troops scattered. In the meantime Xu Huang led his master
over the hills. Soon he met an army of soldiers led by Xiahou Yuan and Zhang
He, who had heard the sound of fighting and had come to the rescue, and Cao Cao
got back safely to camp. The four generals were rewarded.
For fifty days the two armies held each other at bay without coming to a fight.
At the end of this time, orders were given to retire in the camp of Cao Cao.
âWe have not tried the strength of the enemy,â said Jia Xu. âYou should
not retire, my lord.â
âI see that they are always on the alert,â said Cao Cao. âI am only
retiring to put them off their guard. By and by I will send some light horse to
attack their rear. I shall defeat them then.â
âAh! Your skill is unfathomable!â cried Jia Xu.
Three thousand horsemen led by Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He got round behind the
Yangping Pass by unfrequented roads, while Cao Cao broke up his camp and led
his main body backward.
When Yang Ang heard of the retreat, he thought it would be a good chance to
attack.
But Yan Ren opposed it, saying, âCao Cao is full of ruses. The occasion is
unclear. We should not lead an attack.â
Yang Ang was willful and said, âI shall go. You may come or not, as you
wish.â
In spite of the protestations of his colleague, Yang Ang marched, taking with
him the soldiers of five camps and leaving only a few defenders. The day he set
out was very foggy, so that one could hardly see his neighborâs face, and
soon the force got into difficulties and could not advance. They bivouacked on
the road.
Now, Xiahou Yuan was out with a reconnoitering force behind the hills when they
heard the voices of troops and the neighing of horses. In the dense fog they
could see nothing; but fearing an ambush, they hastened to retire. Somehow they
lost their way and presently stumbled on the deserted camp of Yang Ang. The few
defenders thought their comrades had returned, so they threw open the gates to
let the troops of Cao Cao in. They found an empty camp, and they raised a great
blaze, which frightened those few defenders in the other camps so that they
fled.
As soon as the fog cleared, Yan Ren came to the rescue. But as Yan Ren and
Xiahou Yuan were fighting, Zhang He suddenly appeared and attacked from the
rear. Between two armies, Yan Ren forced his way through and quickly fled
toward Nanzheng.
By and by, when Yang Ang returned, he found his camp in the possession of Cao
Caoâs troops. Soon Cao Caoâs main army came up, and Yang Ang was between
two forces. There seemed no other way but to make a dash for it. Falling in
with Zhang He, the two engaged, and Yang Ang fell. Those who escaped carried
the news of the disaster to Zhang Wei, who abandoned Yangping Pass and fled.
So the invaders took possession of the Pass, and its late defenders, Zhang Wei
and Yan Ren, had to go back and report failure.
Zhang Wei laid the blame on his generals, saying, ï¿½The Pass could not be held
after its supporting positions had been lost.ï¿½
Zhang Lu threatened to behead Yan Ren for his failure.
But Yan Ren said, âYang Ang did not listen to my advice, and the defeat
followed. Now I volunteer to make another attack. If I fail to take Cao Caoâs
head, I will abide by the consequences without protest.â
Zhang Lu took his formal pledge to succeed, gave him twenty thousand troops,
and sent him away. Yan Ren marched to Nanzheng and made a stockade.
Before Cao Cao made any further advance, he sent Xiahou Yuan, with five
thousand troops, to reconnoiter the road, and they fell in with the force led
by Yan Ren. Both sides drew up their battle array. From Yan Renâs side went
out one general named Chang Qi to engage Xiahou Yuan. Before the fourth bout
was fought, Xiahou Yuan disposed of Chang Qi. Then Yan Ren set his spear and
rode to the front. They two fought near forty bouts and neither could claim
victory. Then Xiahou Yuan pretended defeat and fled. The other rushed in
pursuit. The fugitive suddenly employed the âswinging-horse stabâ and
killed his pursuer. Yan Renâs troops ran away.
As soon as Cao Cao knew of the death of Yan Ren, he brought up his army,
marched straightway to Nanzheng and camped.
Zhang Lu became alarmed and called a council.
âI can propose a man able to stand against the best leader of the enemy,â
said Yan Pu.
âWho is he?â asked Zhang Lu.
âPang De of Nanan. Pang De surrendered at the same time as Ma Chao, but could
not go with Ma Chao into Yizhou as he was ill. You have treated him generously.
He will save you.â
Pang De was summoned. He came, and Zhang Lu loaded him with gifts and gave him
a force of ten thousand troops, with which he marched and camped three miles
from the city, near the besieging force. His camp made, Pang De rode out and
challenged.
Now Cao Cao, remembering Pang Deâs boldness at the battle of River Wei
Bridge, was desirous of winning the warrior for himself.
So Cao Cao told his generals, saying, âPang De is a bold general of Xiliang
formerly serving under Ma Chao. Though he is now under Zhang Lu, that is not
his real wish. I want to win him over. So you should try to weary him by
prolonging the fights, and so make him captive.â
Wherefore first rode out Zhang He to answer the challenger. He fought a few
bouts and returned. Then Xiahou Yuan did the same thing. So did Xu Huang.
Lastly went Xu Chu, who kept up the fight to half a hundred bouts before he
retired. Still Pang De showed no signs of fatigue nor of fear, and all those
who had fought with him praised his prowess and skill.
âIf only I could win him over to my side!â said Cao Cao longingly.
Said Jia Xu, âI know one of Zhang Luâs subordinates, Yang Song. He is
avaricious and open to bribes. You might send him secret presents and get him
to slander Pang De to his master so as to weaken Pang Deâs position.â
âBut how can one get at this man? He is in Nanzheng.â
âIn the next battle, pretend defeat, flee, and let Pang De take possession of
this camp. Return in the night in force and drive him out, and he must retreat
into the city. Let one of our own people with a persuasive tongue mingle with
his troops, disguised as one of his soldiers, and so gain entrance into the
city.â
A subtle agent was found, and goodly gifts were his in advance, and he was
entrusted with a golden breastplate as a bribe. He put it on and over it put on
the dress of an ordinary soldier of Hanzhong. And he made his way quietly to a
point on the road along which the soldiers of Hanzhong would retreat into the
city. There he waited.
Next day, two parties under Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He were sent to lie in
ambush, and Xu Huang was sent to challenge, but with orders to be defeated. The
scheme went well, and as Pang De came on to smite, Cao Caoâs army retired
before Pang De till he found himself at their very camp. And therein he entered
and was exceedingly pleased to find fodder and forage in great quantities.
Having sent off a messenger to his chief, Pang De spread a feast in celebration
of the victory; and when night came on they slept. But about the second watch
there was an alarm from three directions, and the camp was threatened by three
forces: Xu Chu and Xu Huang attacking in the center, Zhang He from the left,
and Xiahou Yuan from the right. It was the night attack arranged by Cao Cao,
and Pang De could not make any defense. He got to horse, cut his way through,
and made for the city. With the attackers in close pursuit, Pang De reached the
gate, got it opened, and rushed in.
And the false soldier got in amid the confusion. He made his way quickly to
Yang Songâs residence and saw him.
He told Yang Song, saying, âThe Great Prime Minister, Duke of Wei, knows you
by reputation and holds you in great esteem. And as a token thereof he has sent
you his golden breastplate and a confidential letter as well.â
Yang Song took it all in, read the letter, and said, âI will reply by and by,
and the Duke of Wei needs feel no anxiety for I shall find a means of proving
my gratitude. You may return.â
Soon after, Yang Song went to see Zhang Lu and told him, saying, âPang De has
been defeated because he has been bribed by Cao Cao.â
Forthwith Zhang Lu summoned his general, abused him, and threatened to put him
to death. Yan Pu, however, protested and proposed to test Pang De in another
encounter.
Zhang Lu then said, âTomorrow, if you lose, I will take your head!â
Pang De retired full of resentment.
The next day Cao Cao attacked, and Pang De went out to repel him. Cao Cao sent
out Xu Chu, but bade him pretend defeat. When Pang De pursued, Cao Cao rode
toward the hills, where he halted and presently got speech with Pang De.
Cao Cao called out, âPang De! Why not surrender?â
But Pang De thought within himself that to capture Cao Cao would be a fine
exploit, so he boldly faced his escort and rode up the hills. But there arose a
great shouting as if heaven and earth were clashing together, and he and his
followers went headlong into ditches and pits that had been dug. Out flew Cao
Caoâs troops with ropes and hooks, and Pang De was a prisoner.
When he was taken to Cao Cao, he was received with the greatest kindness. Cao
Cao himself dismounted, loosed the captiveâs bonds, and asked him, âDo you
surrender?â
Pang De thought of the ill-treatment he had just received at the hands of his
master and of his injustice, and gave in. At once Pang De was helped to mount a
horse by Cao Cao himself and led to the great camp.
Soldiers placed for the purpose on the city wall saw what happened and reported
to Zhang Lu: âPang De has ridden off on friendly terms with Cao Cao.â
Whereby Zhang Lu was persuaded that Yang Song had spoken truly.
Soon after, scaling ladders were set against the city walls, and catapults
threw in great stones.
The danger being imminent, Zhang Wei counseled, saying, âSet all supplies on
fire and flight to the Southern Mountains, where we might be able to defend
Bazhong.â
On the other hand, Yang Song said, âThe best course is to throw open the
gates and surrender.â
Zhang Lu could not decide which to do. His brother, Zhang Wei, maintained that
burning everything and flight was the only course.
Zhang Lu said, âI have been always loyal at heart and desired to return to
allegiance when circumstances would permit. I have been unable to attain my
desire, but now fight seems the only course open to me. However, the granaries
and treasures, the public offices, and the government property of all kinds
must be kept safe.â
So the public buildings were all carefully barred and sealed. The same night,
in the late evening, Zhang Lu and his family went out through the south gate
and found their way through. Cao Cao let them go unpursued. When Cao Cao
entered the city and saw the proofs of Zhang Luâs care of the government
property, he compassionated the Governorâs misfortunes. He then sent a
messenger into Bazhong to induce Zhang Lu to surrender. Zhang Lu was disposed
to do so, but his brother would not hear of it. Yang Song wrote a secret letter
to Cao Cao urging him to attack and promising treacherous aid.
Cao Cao presently attacked, and Zhang Wei came out to meet him. But his
opponent was the mighty Xu Chu, who made short work of him. The beaten soldiers
fled back into the city, which Zhang Lu then decided to defend.
As this would not give Yang Song the chance to carry out his treacherous
scheme, he persuaded his master, saying, âIf we stay passive, death will
surely come. My lord should go out and fight the enemy to the conclusion,
leaving me to defend the city.â
Zhang Lu took this advice, although it was opposed by Yan Pu, and went out. But
before his van got near the enemy, his rear ranks began to desert, and Zhang Lu
retreated. Cao Cao pursued him to the city walls, where Zhang Lu found the
gates shut against him.
âSurrender, O Zhang Lu!â cried Cao Cao.
There being now no way open, Zhang Lu dismounted, prostrated himself, and gave
in. Because of this and his care of the public property, Cao Cao treated him
with great kindness and consoled him with the title of General Who Guards the
South. Yan Pu and many others also were enrolled among the nobles. To each
county was appointed a Military Commander, in addition to the Governor. All the
soldiers were feasted and rewarded.
Then Yang Song, who had sold his master, came and sued for honors. He was
condemned to public execution and exposure.
Selling oneâs lord may make great service,
But the gains thereof are vanity;
No glory clings to his house but a shameful death,
Wherefore Yang Song is an object of contempt forever.
When the East River Land was quite subdued, First Secretary Sima Yi said,
âThe people of Shu are not loyal to Liu Bei because of his uprooting the late
ruler, Liu Zhang. If on the strength of your present success you press forward,
Liu Bei will become as a shattered tile. The wise person takes the occasion
when it serves, and this should not be missed.â
Cao Cao sighed, âThere is no end â-as human want has no limit: Now that I
have Hanzhong, I am forced into taking Yizhou.â
Liu Ye supported his colleague, saying, âSima Yi spoke well. If you delay,
Zhuge Liang will have become top minister, while Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and the
other bold warriors will be at the head of the army. If the people of Shu once
settle down, and the points of vantage are held, you will not be able to
overcome them.â
Cao Cao replied, âMy soldiers have marched far and suffered much. Beside we
must show pity.â
Wherefore he rested his army for a time.
Meanwhile the populace of Yizhou, having heard of Cao Caoâs success in the
East River Land, concluded that the West River Land would suffer next, and fear
spread among them. Whereupon Liu Bei called in the Directing Instructor and
asked his advice.
Zhuge Liang replied, âI can make Cao Cao retreat of his own accord.â
âWhat is that plan?â
âA part of Cao Caoâs army is camped at Hefei because of the fear of Sun
Quan. If now we restore three territories of Jingzhou â-Changsha, Jiangxia,
and Guiyang â-, and send a specious person to talk, we can make Sun Quan
attack Hefei, which will lead to Cao Cao going southward and not looking to the
west.â
âWho is a fit person for the messenger?â said Liu Bei.
And Yi Ji replied, âI will go.â
Liu Bei, well-satisfied, wrote letters and prepared gifts, with which Yi Ji
went, calling in at Jingzhou City on the way to tell Guan Yu. Then he went on
to the capital city of Jianye and saw Sun Quan.
After the greetings, Sun Quan asked, âOn what business do you come?â
Yi Ji replied, âOn a former occasion Zhuge Jin would have had the three
territories of Changsha, Lingling, and Guiyang, but for the absence of the
Directing Instructor, which prevented the actual transfer. Now I am the bearer
of letters giving Changsha, Guiyang, and Jiangxia back to you. Liu Bei and
Zhuge Liang wanted to restore all the territories of Jingzhou, including those
of Xiangyang, Nanjun, and Lingling. But now that Cao Cao has got possession of
East River Land, there is no place for General Guan Yu. Hefei is weak, and we
hope you will attack it so as to make Cao Cao withdraw to the south and let my
master take the East River Land, when he will restore the whole of the Jingzhou
Region.â
âGo back to the guest-house, and let me take counsel in this matter,â said
Sun Quan.
As soon as Yi Ji had gone, the Marquis of Wu turned to his officers and asked
what should be done.
Zhang Zhao said, âAll this is because Liu Bei fears that Cao Cao will attack
him. However, since Cao Cao is absent in Hanzhong, it would be well to seize
the opportunity and attack Hefei.â
Sun Quan accepted the advice. After he had sent the messenger away, he began to
prepare for the expedition. He left Lu Su in command over the three territories
of Changsha, Jiangxia, and Guiyang. Then Sun Quan encamped at Lukou, withdrew
Generals Lu Meng and Gan Ning, and sent to Yuhang for General Ling Tong.
In a few days, Lu Meng and Gan Ning returned.
Lu Meng suggested a plan, saying, âCao Cao has sent Zhu Guang, Governor of
Lujiang, to camp at the city of Huancheng and plant grain for the supply of
Hefei. Let us first take Huancheng first, and then attack Hefei.â
âThis scheme is just after my own heart,â said Sun Quan.
So Sun Quan appointed Lu Meng and Gan Ning as Van Leaders; Jiang Qin and Pan
Zhang as Rear Guards; he himself with Zhou Tai, Chen Wu, Dong Xi, and Xu Sheng
commanded the center. But the Commanders Cheng Pu, Huang Gai, and Han Dang were
not called to take part in this expedition as they were guarding certain
especial places.
The army crossed the river and captured Hezhou on the way. Governor Zhu Guang
sent an urgent message to Hefei for help and set himself to strengthen his
fortifications for a siege. Sun Quan went very near the city walls of Huancheng
to observe its defense, and a flight of arrows greeted him, some striking his
great official parasol. He went back to camp and asked his officers to offer
plans of attack.
Then Dong Xi said, âPile up great hills of earth and attack from the
summits.â
Said Xu Sheng, âSet up long ladders and construct platforms whence you can
look over the city walls and thus attack.â
But Lu Meng said, âAll such plans need a long time to prepare, and in the
meantime the soldiers of Cao Cao will arrive from Hefei. Do not try such long-
drawn-out schemes, but take advantage of the fine, fresh spirit of our newly
arrived troops and attack impetuously. Their elan will carry the wall. If you
attack tomorrow at dawn, the city will fall before noon.â
So the early meal was taken at the fifth watch, and the army went to the
attack. The defenders sent down showers of arrows and stones. Gan Ning took an
iron chain in his hand and climbed up the wall. They shot at him with bows and
crossbows, but he turned aside the arrows and bolts, and he threw the chain
round Governor Zhu Guang to pull him down. Lu Meng beat the drum for the
attack. The soldiers made a rush forward to climb the wall, and they slew Zhu
Guang. His officers and soldiers gave in, and so Huancheng fell to Sun Quan. It
was still a long time to noon.
In the meantime Zhang Liao was marching to the aid of the city. Half-way he
heard that the city had fallen, and so he returned to Hefei.
Soon after the conquerorâs entry into Huancheng, Ling Tong came there with
his army. The next few days were devoted to feasting the army. Special rewards
were given to the two generals who had done such good work at the capture; and
at the banquet to the officers, Gan Ning was seated in the seat of honor, which
his colleague, Lu Meng, readily yielded to him for his late prowess.
But as the cup of felicitation was passing round, Ling Tongâs thoughts turned
to the enmity he bore Gan Ning for having slain his father, and the praises
which Lu Meng now heaped upon Gan Ning filled Ling Tongâs heart with
bitterness. For some time he glared savagely at Gan Ning, and then he
determined on revenge.
Drawing his sword, Ling Tong suddenly rose to his feet and cried, âThere is
nothing to amuse the assembly. I will give them a display of swordsmanship!â
Gan Ning quickly saw his real intention. He pushed back his table and laid hold
of a halberd in each hand, crying, âAnd you may also watch an adept in the
use of this weapon!â
Lu Meng saw the evil meaning of both, and assuming his sword and shield, he
hastily stepped between the two warriors, saying, âNeither of you gentlemen
is so dexterous as I.â
So he forced the two combatants asunder, while someone ran to tell Sun Quan.
The Marquis hastily jumped into the saddle and rode to the banquet hall. At
sight of their lord, they all three lowered their weapons.
âI have bidden you two to forget this old enmity,â said Sun Quan. âWhy do
you revive it today?â
Ling Tong prostrated himself in tears. Sun Quan exhorted him to forget his
quarrel, and once again there was peace.
The next day the army set out for Hefei.
Because of the loss of Huancheng, Zhang Liao grieved greatly. Cao Cao had sent
by the hands of Xue Ti a small casket sealed with his own seal and bearing
outside the words, âIf rebels come, open this.â
So when he received the news of the coming of a powerful army, Zhang Liao
opened the casket and read the letter therein:
âIf Sun Quan comes to attack Hefei, the two Generals Li Dian and Zhang Liao
are to go out to oppose him, and Yue Jing is to be left to guard the walls.â
Zhang Liao sent the letter to the two men named therein.
âWhat do you think to do?â said Yue Jing.
Zhang Liao replied, âOur lord is away, and Wu is coming to attack for
certain. We must go out to repel them and exert ourselves to the utmost to
inflict defeat upon their advanced guard. Thus we shall appease the fears of
the populace, and then we can hold as best we may.â
But Li Dian was silent, for he was ever unfriendly to Zhang Liao.
Then seeing his colleague inclined to hold off, Yue Jing said, âI am for
remaining on the defensive, since the enemy is so much more numerous than
we.â
âGentlemen, it seems you are selfish and not devoted to the common weal,â
said Zhang Liao. âYou may have your private reasons for what you do, but I
intend to go out and try to repel the enemy. I will fight them to the death.â
Thereupon Zhang Liao bade his servants saddle his steed.
At this, Li Dianâs better feelings were aroused, and he rose, saying, âHow
can I be careless of the common weal and indulge my private feelings? I am
ready to follow you and do as you command.â
Zhang Liao was elated at this moral victory, and said, âSince I can depend
upon your help, my friend, then I would ask you to lie in ambush on the north
of Xiaoyao Ford in order to destroy the Xiaoshi Bridge there as soon as the
army of Wu has crossed. I, with my friend Yue Jing, will smite the enemy.â
Li Dian went away to muster his troops and prepare the ambush.
As has been recorded, the leaders of the advance guard of the southern army
were the veterans Lu Meng and Gan Ning. Sun Quan and Ling Tong were in the
center; the other generals followed them. The leaders of the van met Yue Jing
first, and Gan Ning rode out and challenged him. After a few bouts, Yue Jing
pretended to be defeated and fled. Gan Ning called to his colleague to join in
the pursuit.
When Sun Quan heard that this advance guard had been successful, he hastened
his army to Xiaoyao Ford. But then there came a series of explosions, and up
came Zhang Liao and Li Dian, one on each flank. Sun Quan was unprepared for
this and sent messengers to call off the pursuit and ask for help from Lu Meng
and Gan Ning. Before it could arrived, Zhang Liao had come up. Manifestly, Ling
Tong, who had with him only a small troop of three hundred horse, could not
long withstand the army of Cao Cao, but he faced them and fought bravely.
Presently Ling Tong cried to his lord, âCross the Xiaoshi Bridge and run
back, my lord!â
Sun Quan galloped for the bridge, but the southern end had been already broken
down and there was a wide breach between the end of the bridge and the shore.
Not a single plank was there by which to cross. What could be done? Sun Quan
was in a quandary, and helpless.
âGo back and jump for it!â yelled one of the generals, Gu Li by name.
Sun Quan did so. Backing his horse some thirty spans or so, he then gave it its
head and lashed it with his whip.
The good beast leaped, cleared the chasm and his master was safe on the
southern shore.
Once Dilu leant across the Tan Torrent wide,
And when defeat did Sun Quan of Wu betide,
And death came threateningly at Xiaoyao Ford,
His steed too leapt, and saved him from the sword.
Having reached the farther shore, Sun Quan embarked on one of the boats of Xu
Sheng and Dong Xi and was rowed to a place of safety, while Ling Tong and Gu Li
were still fighting with Zhang Liaoâs army. Gan Ning and Lu Meng, coming to
their aid, were pursued by Yue Jing, and Li Dian also stayed their progress.
But the soldiers of the South Land fought bravely; half of their force fell,
and Ling Tongâs troop of three hundred horse perished all, while Ling Tong
himself was wounded, but found his way to the bridge. Finding it destroyed, he
fled along the stream. Presently he was seen by Sun Quan from the boat and
taken on board by Dong Xi. Gan Ning and Lu Meng also cut their ways back to the
southern shore.
The terrible slaughter at this battle put such fear into the minds of the
people of the South Land that the name of Zhang Liao kept the very children
quiet at night.
When Sun Quan reached his camp, he richly rewarded Ling Tong and Gu Li. Then he
led his army back to Ruxu and began to put his ships in order so that the army
and navy might act in unison. He also sent home for reinforcements.
Zhang Liao reflected that he had insufficient force to meet another attack if
it should be supported by the navy of the South Land, so he sent Xue Ti through
the night to carry an urgent message to his master in Hanzhong. When the
messenger arrived, Cao Cao saw that his western expedition would have to yield
to the urgency of home defense. However, he called in his counselors and put a
direct question to them.
âCan we take West River Land now, or not?â
âShu is too well prepared; we cannot,â replied Liu Ye. âIt is better to
go to the succor of Hefei, and then go down the river to take the South
Land.â
Wherefore, leaving Xiahou Yuan to station at the Dingjun Mountain to guard
Hanzhong, and Zhang He to keep Mount Mengtou Pass, Cao Cao broke up his camp
and went toward Ruxu with all his commanders.
The armored horsemen had conquered Hanzhong,
The ensigns toward the south were turned again.
The subsequent course of the war will be unfolded in later chapters.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 68 ****
Sun Quan was occupied in ordering his army at Ruxu when he heard of the coming
of Cao Cao from Hanzhong with four hundred thousand troops to the relief of
Hefei. He told off a fleet of fifty large ships to lie in the port, while Chen
Wu went up and down the river banks on the look-out.
âIt would be well to inflict a defeat upon Cao Caoâs army before they
recover from the long march. It would dishearten them,â said Zhang Zhao.
Looking around at the officers in his tent, Sun Quan said, âWho is bold
enough to go forth and fight this Cao Cao and so take the keen edge off the
spirit of his army?â
And Ling Tong offered himself, saying, âI will go!â
âHow many soldiers do you require?â
âThree thousand troops will suffice,â replied Ling Tong.
But Gan Ning struck in, saying, âOnly a hundred horse would be needed. Why
send three thousand?â
Ling Tong was angry, and he and Gan Ning began to wrangle even in the presence
of their chief.
âCao Caoâs army is too strong to be attacked recklessly,â said Sun Quan.
Finally he gave the commission to Ling Tong with his three thousand, bidding
him reconnoiter just outside Ruxu, and fight the enemy if he met him.
Marching out, Ling Tong very soon saw a great cloud of dust, which marked the
approach of an army. As soon as they came near enough, Zhang Liao, who led the
van, engaged with Ling Tong, and they fought half a hundred bouts without sign
of victory for either. Then Sun Quan began to fear for his champion, so he sent
Lu Meng to extricate Ling Tong from the battle and escort him home.
When Ling Tong had come back, his rival Gan Ning went to Sun Quan and said,
âNow let me have the hundred horsemen, and I will raid the enemyâs camp
this night. If I lose a soldier or a mount, I will claim no merit.â
Sun Quan commended his courage and chose a hundred of his best veterans, whom
he placed under Gan Ningâs command for the raid. Sun Quan also gave him as a
feast for the soldiers fifty flasks of wine and seventy five pounds of mutton.
Returning to the tents, Gan Ning drew up his little force and made them sit
down in rows. Then he filled two silver goblets with wine and solemnly drank to
them.
Next he said, âComrades, tonight our orders are to raid the camp of the
enemy. Wherefore fill your goblets and call up all your strength for the
task.â
But the men did not welcome his words. Instead they looked one at another
uncertain.
Seeing them in this mood, Gan Ning adopted a fierce tone, drew his sword and
cried, âWhat are you waiting for? If I, a leader of rank, can risk my life,
cannot you?â
Moved by the angry face of the leader, the men rose, bowed their heads and
said, âWe will fight to the last!â
Then the wine and meat were distributed to them and each one ate his fill. The
second watch was chosen as the hour to start, and each man stuck a white goose
plume in his cap whereby they could recognize each other in the darkness.
At the time appointed they buckled on their armor, mounted and, galloping away,
quickly came to Cao Caoâs camp. Hastily throwing aside the thorny barriers,
they burst in with a yell that rose to the very heavens. They made straight for
the center, hoping to slay Cao Cao himself. But the troops of the leaderâs
brigade had made a rampart of their carts within which they were sheltered as
if in an iron tun, so that the raiders failed to find a way in.
However, Gan Ning and his small force dashed hither and thither, cutting and
slashing, till Cao Caoâs men were quite bewildered and frightened. They had
no notion of the number of their assailants. All their efforts only increased
the confusion. Wherefore the hundred men had it all their own way and rushed
from point to point slaying whomever they met. But soon the drums beat in every
camp and torches were lit and shouts arose, and it was time for the raiders to
get away.
Gan Ning led his little body of troops out through the south gate with never a
soldier trying to stop him, and rode for his own camp. He met Zhou Tai, who had
been sent to help him in case of need; but the need had not arisen, and the
hundred heroes with their leader rode back in triumph. There was no pursuit.
A poem was written praising this exploit:
The drums of war make earth to shake
When the South Land comes near even devils quake.
People long will tell of that night raid,
That Gan Ningâs goose-plumed warriors made.
On his return, Gan Ning took the tale of his men at the camp gate, not a man
nor a horse was missing. He entered to the sound of drum and fife and the
shouting of his men.
âLong life!â shouted they, as Sun Quan came to welcome them.
Gan Ning dismounted and prostrated himself.
His lord raised him, and took him by the hand, saying, âThis expedition of
yours must have given those rebels a shaking. I had yielded to your desire only
I wished to give you the opportunity to manifest your valor. I did not wish to
let you be sacrificed.â
Gan Ningâs exploit was rewarded with gifts, a thousand rolls of silk and a
hundred keen swords, all of which he distributed among his soldiers.
Sun Quan was very proud of his subordinateâs doughty deed, and said, âCao
Cao may have his Zhang Liao, but I can match him with my friend Gan Ning.â
Soon Zhang Liao came to proffer another challenge, and Ling Tong, impatient at
being excelled by his rival and enemy, begged that he might go out to fight.
His request was granted, and he marched out a short distance from Ruxu with
five thousand troops. Sun Quan, with Gan Ning in his train, went out to look on
at the encounter.
When both armies had come out on the plain and were arrayed, Zhang Liao, with
Li Dian and Yue Jing, one on either side, advanced to the front. Ling Tong,
sword in hand, galloped out towards him and, at Zhang Liaoâs command, Yue
Jing took the challenge and went to open the combat. They fought half a hundred
bouts, and neither seemed to have the better of the other.
Then Cao Cao, hearing of the great contest going on, rode up to the battlefield
and took position under the great standard, whence he could see the fighting.
Seeing both combatants were waxing desperate, he thought to decide the struggle
by an unfair blow. He bade Cao Xiu let fly a secret arrow, which Cao Xiu did by
creeping up under cover of Zhang Liao. It struck Ling Tongâs steed, which
reared and threw its rider. Yue Jing dashed forward to thrust at the fallen
warrior with his spear, but before the blow could be given, the twang of
another bow was heard and an arrow speeding by hit Yue Jing full in the face.
He fell from his horse. Then both sides rushed forward to rescue their
champions. The gongs clanged, and the combat ceased. Ling Tong returned to his
camp and reported himself to his master.
âThe arrow that saved you was shot by Gan Ning,â said Sun Quan.
Ling Tong turned to his rival and bowed low.
âI could not have supposed you would have rendered me such a service, Sir,â
said he to Gan Ning.
This episode ended the strife and enmity between the two leaders, who
thereafter swore perpetual friendship.
On the other side Cao Cao saw to it that Yue Jingâs wound was dressed. Next
day he launched an attack against Ruxu along five different lines. He himself
led one army in the center; on the left Zhang Liao and Li Dian led two armies;
on the right Xu Huang and Pang De commanded the other two. Each army was ten
thousand strong, and they marched to give battle on the river bank. The crews
and fighting troops of the South Landâs naval squadron were greatly
frightened by the approach of these armies.
âYou have eaten the bread of your prince, and you must give loyal service.
Why fear?â said Xu Sheng.
Thereupon he put some hundreds of his best men into small boats, went along the
bank, and broke into the legion under Li Dian. Meanwhile Dong Xi on the ships
beat drums and cheered them on. But a great storm came on, lashing the river to
fury, and the waves rolled mountains high. The larger ships rolled as if they
would overturn, and the soldiers of Wu were frightened. They started to get
down into the bulkier cargo-boats to save their lives. But Dong Xi threatened
them with his sword, cutting down some half score of the mutineers.
âMy orders are to hold this point against the enemy,â shouted he. âWe
dare not abandon the ships!â
However, the wind increased, and presently the bold Dong Xi was thrown into the
river by the rolling of his ship and was drowned, together with his men.
Xu Sheng dashed hither and thither among Li Dianâs army, slaying right and
left. Chen Wu, hearing the noise of battle, set out for the river bank. On his
way Chen Wu met Pang De and the legion under him. A melee ensued. Then Sun Quan
with Zhou Tai and his troops joined in.
The small force from the ships that had attacked Li Dian was now surrounded. So
Sun Quan gave the signal for an onslaught that should rescue them. This failed,
and Sun Quan was himself surrounded in turn and soon in desperate straits. From
a height, Cao Cao saw his difficulties and sent in Xu Chu to cut Sun Quanâs
column in halves so that neither half could aid the other.
When Zhou Tai had cut an alley out of the press and reached the riverside, he
looked for his master. But Sun Quan was nowhere visible, so Zhou Tai dashed
once again into the battle.
Coming to his own troops, he cried, âWhere is our lord?â
They pointed to where the press was most dense. Zhou Tai stiffened and dashed
in.
Presently he reached his lordâs side and cried out, âMy lord, follow me,
and I will hack a way out!â
Zhou Tai fought his way out to the river bank. Then he turned to look, and Sun
Quan was not behind him. So he turned back, forced his way in, and once again
found his way to his masterâs side.
âI cannot get out. The arrows are too thick!â said Sun Quan.
âThen go first, my lord, and I will follow!â
Sun Quan then urged his steed as fast as he could go, and Zhou Tai kept off all
pursuit. Zhou Tai sustained many wounds and the arrows rattled on his helmet,
but he got clear at last and Sun Quan was safe. As they neared the river bank,
Lu Meng came up with some of the naval force and escorted Sun Quan down to the
ships.
âI owe my safety to Zhou Tai, who thrice came to my aid,â said Sun Quan.
âBut Xu Sheng is still in the thick of the fight, and how can we save him?â
âI will go to his rescue,â cried Zhou Tai.
Whirling his spear, Zhou Tai again plunged into the battle and presently
brought his colleague safely out of the press. Both were severely wounded.
Lu Meng ordered his troops to keep up a rapid flight of arrows so as to command
the bank, and in this way the two leaders were enabled to get on board the
ships.
Now Chen Wu had engaged the legion under Pang De. Being inferior in force and
no aid being forthcoming, Chen Wu was forced into a valley where the trees and
undergrowth were very dense. He tried to turn, but was caught by the branches,
and while so entangled he was killed by Pang De.
When Cao Cao saw that Sun Quan had escaped from the battle to the river bank,
he urged his steed forward in pursuit. He sent flights of arrows toward the
fugitives. By this time Lu Mengâs troops had emptied their quivers, and he
began to be very anxious. But just then a fleet of ships sailed up led by Lu
Xun, the son-in-law of Sun Ce, who came with one hundred thousand marines and
drove back Cao Caoâs army. Then he landed to pursue. He captured many
thousands of horses and slew many men, so that Cao Cao was quite defeated and
retired. Then they sought and found the body of Chen Wu among the slain.
Sun Quan was much grieved when he came to know that Chen Wu had been slain and
Dong Xi drowned, and wept sore. Men were sent to seek for Dong Xiâs body,
which at last was found. Both generals were buried with great honors.
As a recompense for Zhou Taiâs services in Sun Quanâs rescue, Sun Quan
prepared in his honor a great banquet, where Sun Quan himself offered Zhou Tai
a goblet of wine and complimented and embraced him while the tears coursed down
his cheeks.
âTwice you saved my life, careless of your own,â cried Sun Quan, âand you
have received many wounds. It is as if your skin had been engraved and painted.
What sort of a man should I be if I did not treat you as one of my own flesh
and blood? Can I regard you, Noble Sir, merely as a unit in my army? You are my
meritorious minister. I share the glory you have won and mine are your joys and
sorrows.â
Then Sun Quan bade Zhou Tai open his dress and exhibit his wounds for all the
assembly to see. The skin was gashed all over as if his body had been scored
with a knife. Sun Quan pointed to the wounds, one after another, and asked how
each one had been received. And, as Zhou Tai told him, for every wound Sun Quan
made him drink off a goblet of wine till he became thoroughly intoxicated. Sun
Quan then presented him with a green silk parasol and bade him use it on all
occasions as a sign of the glory that was his.
But Sun Quan found his opponents too stable. At the end of a month the two
armies were both at Ruxu and neither had won a victory.
Then said Zhang Zhao and Gu Yong, âCao Cao is too strong, and we cannot
overcome him by mere force. If the struggle continues longer, you will only
lose more soldiers. You had better seek to make peace.â
Sun Quan followed this advice and dispatched Bu Zhi on a peace mission to Cao
Caoâs camp. Sun Quan offered a yearly tribute. Cao Cao also saw that the
South Land was too strong to be overcome, and consented.
Cao Cao insisted, âThe Marquis should first send away his army, and then I
would retire.â
Bu Zhi returned with this message, and Sun Quan sent away the greater part,
leaving only Zhou Tai and Jiang Qin to hold Ruxu. The army returned to Capital
Jianye.
Cao Cao left Cao Ren and Zhang Liao in charge of Hefei, and he marched the army
back to Capital Xuchang.
On arrival, all Cao Caoâs officers, military and civil, persuaded him to
become Prince of Wei. Only the Chair of the Secretariat, Cui Yan, spoke
strongly against the scheme.
âYou are, then, the only man who knows not the fate of Xun Yu,â said his
colleagues.
âSuch times! Such deeds!â cried Cui Yan. âYou are guilty of rebellion,
but you may commit it yourselves. I will bear no part in it.â
Certain enemies told Cao Cao, and Cui Yan was thrown into prison. At his trial
he glared like a tiger, and his very beard curled with contempt. He raged and
cursed at Cao Cao for a betrayer of his prince, and a rebel. The interrogating
magistrate reported his conduct to Cao Cao, who ordered Cui Yan to be beaten to
death in prison.
Cui Yan of Qinghe,
Firm and unyielding was he,
With beard crisp curling and gleaming eyes,
Which showed the man of stone and iron within.
He drove the evil from his presence,
And his glory is fair and high.
For loyalty to his lord of Han,
His fame shall increase as the ages roll.
In the twenty-first year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (216), in the fifth month of
that year, a great memorial signed by many officers went up to Emperor Xian,
praying:
âThe Duke of Wei has rendered so great services that no minister before him,
in Heaven as well as on Earth, not even Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou, could
match his manifest merits to the state. Thus, the title of kingship should be
granted to him.â
The memorial was approved, and a draft edict was prepared by the famous Zhong
Yao to make Cao Cao Prince of Wei. Thrice Cao Cao with seeming modesty
pretended to decline the honor, but thrice was his refusal rejected. Finally he
made his obeisance and was enrolled as Prince of Wei with the usual insignia
and privileges, a coronet with twelve strings of beads and a chariot with gilt
shafts, drawn by six steeds. Using the formalities of the Son of God, he
decorated his imperial chariot with bells and had the roads cleared when he
passed along. He built himself a Palace at Yejun.
Then he began to discuss the appointment of an heir-apparent. His principal
wife, Lady Ding, was without issue; but a concubine, Lady Liu, had borne him a
son, Cao Ang, who had been killed in battle at the siege of Wancheng when Cao
Cao fought against Zhang Xiu. A second concubine, Lady Bian, had borne him four
sons: Cao Pi, Cao Zhang, Cao Zhi, and Cao Xiong. Wherefore he elevated Lady
Bian to the rank of Queen of Wei in place of Lady Ding.
The third son, Cao Zhi, was very clever and a ready master of composition. Cao
Cao wished him to be named the heir.
Then the eldest son, Cao Pi sought from the High Adviser Jia Xu a plan to
secure his rights of primogeniture, and Jia Xu told him to do so and so.
Thereafter, whenever the father went out on any military expedition, Cao Zhi
wrote fulsome panegyrics, but Cao Pi wept so copiously at bidding his father
farewell that the courtiers were deeply affected and remarked that though Cao
Zhi was crafty and clever, he was not so sincerely filial as Cao Pi. Cao Pi
also bought over his fatherâs immediate attendants, who then rang the praises
of his virtues so loud that Cao Cao was strongly disposed to name him as the
heir after all.
After hesitating a long time, the matter was referred to Jia Xu.
âI wish to name my heir. Who shall it be?â said Cao Cao.
Jia Xu would not say, and Cao Cao asked why.
âI was just recalling the past in my mind and could not reply at once,â
said Jia Xu.
âWhat were you recalling?â
âI was thinking of two fathers, Yuan Shao and Liu Biao, and their sons.â
Cao Cao laughed. Soon after this he declared his eldest son his heir.
In the winter of that year, in the tenth month, the building of the Palace of
the new Prince of Wei was completed, and the furnishing begun. From all parts
were collected rare flowers and uncommon trees to beautify the gardens. One
agent went into the South Land and saw Sun Quan, to whom he presented a letter
from Cao Cao asking that he might be allowed to proceed to Wenzhou to get some
oranges. At that period Sun Quan was in a most complaisant mood toward Cao Cao,
so from the orange trees in his own city, he picked forty loads of very fine
fruits and sent them immediately to Yejun.
On the way, the bearers of the oranges fell tired, and they had to stop at the
foot of a certain hill. There came along an elderly man, blind of one eye and
lame of one leg, who wore a white rattan headdress and a black loose robe. He
saluted the bearers and stayed to talk.
Presently he said, âYour burdens are heavy, O Porters. May this old Daoist
lend you a shoulder? What do you say?â
Naturally they were pleased enough, and the amiable wayfarer bore each load for
two miles. When they resumed their burdens, they noticed that the loads seemed
lighter than before, and they felt rather suspicious.
When the Daoist was taking his leave of the officer in charge of the party, he
said, âI am an old friend from the same village as the Prince of Wei. My name
is Zuo Ci. Among Daoists I bear the appellation of âBlack Hornâ. When you
get to the end of your journey, you may say that I was inquiring after your
lord.â
Zuo Ci shook down his sleeves and left. In due course the orange bearers
reached the new Palace, and the oranges were presented. But when Cao Cao cut
one open, it was but an empty shell of a thing: There was no pulp beneath the
rind. Cao Cao was rather puzzled and called in the porters, who told him of
their falling in with the mysterious Daoist on the way. But Cao Cao scouted the
idea of that being the reason.
But just then the warden of the gate sent to say that a certain Daoist named
Zuo Ci was at the gate and wished to see the king.
âSend him in,â said Cao Cao.
âHe is the man we met on the way,â said the porters when he appeared.
Cao Cao said curtly, âWhat sorcery have you been exercising on my beautiful
fruit?â
âHow could such a thing happen?â said the Daoist.
Thereupon he cut open an orange and showed it full of pulp, most delicious to
the taste. But when Cao Cao cut open another, that again was empty, nothing but
rind.
Cao Cao was more than ever perplexed. He bade his visitor be seated, and, as
Zuo Ci asked for refreshment, wine and food were brought in. The Daoist ate
ravenously, consuming a whole sheep, and drank in proportion. Yet he showed no
sign of intoxication or repletion.
âBy what magic are you here?â said Cao Cao.
âI am but a poor Daoist. I went into Jialing in Shu, and on Emei Mountain, I
studied the way for thirty long years. One day I heard my name called from out
the rocky wall of my cell. I looked, but could see nothing. The same thing
happened next day, and so on for many days. Then suddenly, with a roar like
thunder, the rock split asunder, and I saw a sacred book in three volumes
called âThe Book of Concealing Methodââ-the first volume was named
âConcealing Heavenâ, the second âConcealing Earthâ, and the third
âConcealing Humanâ. From the first volume I learned to ascend to the clouds
astride the wind, to sail up into the great void itself; from the second to
pass through mountains and penetrate rocks; from the third, to float light as
vapor, over the seas, to become invisible at will or change my shape, to fling
swords and project daggers so as to decapitate a man from a distance. You, O
Prince, have reached the acme of glory. Why not now withdraw and, like me,
become a disciple of the Daoists? Why not travel to Emei Mountain and there
mend your ways so that I may bequeath my three volumes to you?â
âOft have I reflected upon this course and struggled against my fate, but
what can I do? There is no one to maintain the government,â replied Cao Cao.
âThere is Liu Bei of Yizhou, a scion of the dynastic family. Could you not
make way for him? If you do not, I may have to send one of my flying swords
after your head one day.â
âYou are one of his secret agents,â said Cao Cao, suddenly enraged.
âSeize him!â cried he to his lictors.
They did so, while the Daoist laughed. And Zuo Ci continued to laugh as they
dragged him down to the dungeons, where they beat him cruelly. And when they
had finished, the Daoist lay there gently respiring in a sound sleep, just as
if he felt nothing whatever.
This enraged Cao Cao still more, and he bade them put the priest into the large
wooden collar and nail it securely and then chain him in a cell. And Cao Cao
set guards over him, and the guards saw the collar and chains just fall off
while the victim lay fast asleep not injured in the least.
The Daoist lay in prison seven days without food or water. But when they went
to look at him, he was sitting upright on the ground, quite well and rosy
looking.
The gaolers reported these things to Cao Cao, who had the prisoner brought in.
âI do not mind going without food for years,â said the victim, when Cao Cao
questioned him, âyet I could eat a thousand sheep in a day.â
Cao Cao was at the end of his resources. He could prevail nothing against such
a man.
That day there was to be a great banquet at the new Palace, and guests came in
crowds. When the banquet was in progress and the wine cup passing freely,
suddenly the same Daoist appeared. He had wooden clogs on his feet. All faces
turned in his direction and not a few were afraid; others wondered.
Standing there in front of the great assembly, the Daoist said, âO Powerful
Prince, here today you have every delicacy on the table and a glorious company
of guests. You have rare and beautiful objects from all parts of the world. Is
there anything lacking? If there be anything you would like, name it and I will
get it for you.â
Cao Cao replied, âThen I want a dragonâs liver to make soup: Can you get
that?â
âWhereâs the difficulty?â replied Zuo Ci.
With a pencil the Daoist immediately sketched a dragon on the whitewashed wall
of the banquet hall. Then he flicked his sleeve over it, the dragonâs belly
opened of itself, and therefrom Zuo Ci took the liver all fresh and bloody.
âYou had the liver hidden in your sleeve,â said Cao Cao, incredulous.
âThen there shall be another test,â said the Daoist. âIt is winter and
every plant outside is dead. What flower would you like, O Prince. Name any one
you will.â
âI want a peony,â said Cao Cao.
âEasy,â said the Daoist.
At this request they brought out a flower-pot, which was placed in full view of
the guests. Then he spurted some water over it, and in a very short time up
came a peony with two fully expanded flowers.
The guests were astonished, and they asked the Daoist to be seated and gave him
wine and food. The cook sent in some minced fish.
âThe best mince is made from the perch of River Song,â said the Daoist.
âHow can you get fish five hundred miles away?â said Cao Cao.
âNot at all difficult. Tell someone to get a rod and hook, and fish in the
pond just below this banquet hall.â
They did so, and very soon several beautiful perches lay on the steps.
âI have always kept some of these in my ponds, of course,â said Cao Cao.
âO Prince, do you think to deceive me? All perches have two gills except the
River Song perch, which has two pairs. That is the distinguishing feature.â
The guests crowded round to look, and, surely enough, the fish had four gills.
âTo cook this perch one needs purple sprout ginger though,â said the
Daoist.
âCan you also produce that?â asked Cao Cao.
âEasily.â
Zuo Ci told them to bring in a silver bowl, which the magician filled with
water. Very soon the ginger filled the bowl, and he presented it to the host.
Cao Cao put out his hand to pick some, when suddenly a book appeared in the
bowl and the title was Cao Caoâs New Treatise on the Art of War. He took it
out and read it over. Not a word of his treatise was missing.
Cao Cao became more mystified. Zuo Ci took up a jade cup that stood on the
table, filled it with fine wine, and presented it to Cao Cao.
âDrink this, O Prince, and you will live a thousand years.â
âDrink of it first yourself,â said Cao Cao.
The Daoist took the jade pin from his headdress and drew it across the cup as
if dividing the wine into two portions.
Then he drank one half and handed the cup with the other half to Cao Cao. But
Cao Cao angrily refused it. The Daoist then threw the cup into the air, where
it was transformed into a white dove which circled round the banquet hall and
then flew away.
All faces were turned upward following the flight of the dove, and so no one
had noticed the going of the Daoist. But he was gone; and soon the gate warden
reported that he had left the Palace.
Said Cao Cao, âA magician like this ought to be put to death, or he will do
some mischief.â
The redoubtable Xu Chu and a company of three hundred armed men were sent to
arrest the Daoist. They saw the Daoist, still wearing his wooden clogs, not far
ahead but striding along quickly. Xu Chu rode after Zuo Ci, but in spite of all
his horse could do, he could not come up with Zuo Ci. Xu Chu kept up the chase
right to the hills, when he met a shepherd lad with a flock of sheep. And there
walked the Daoist among the sheep. The Daoist disappeared. The angry warrior
slew the whole flock of sheep, while the shepherd lad looked on weeping.
Suddenly the boy heard a voice from one of the severed heads, telling him to
replace the heads on the bodies of his sheep. Instead of doing so, he fled in
terror, covering his face.
Then he heard a voice calling to him, âDo not run away. You shall have your
sheep again.â
He turned, and lo! the sheep were all alive again, and Zuo Ci was driving them
along. The boy began to question him, but the Daoist made no reply. With a
flick of his sleeves, he was gone.
The shepherd lad went home and told all these marvels to his master, who could
not conceal such a story, and it reached Cao Cao. Then sketches of the Daoist
were sent everywhere with orders to arrest him. Within three days were arrested
in the city and outside three or four hundred persons all blind of one eye,
lame of one leg, and wearing a rattan headdress, a black loose robe and wooden
clogs. They were all alike and all answered to the description of the missing
Daoist.
There was a great hubbub in the street. Cao Cao ordered his officer to sprinkle
the crowd of Daoists with the blood of pigs and goats in order to exorcise the
witchcraft and take them away to the drill ground on the south of the city.
Thither he followed them with his guards, who surrounded the crowd of arrested
persons and slew everyone. But from the neck of each one, after the head was
severed, there floated up into the air a wreath of black vapor, and all these
wreaths drifted toward a center where they joined up into the image of another
Zuo Ci, who presently beckoned to him a white crane out of the sky, mounted it
and sat as on a horse.
Clapping his hands, the Daoist cried merrily, âThe rats of the earth follow
the golden tiger, and one morning the doer of evil shall be no more.â
The soldiers shot arrows at both bird and man. At this a tremendous storm burst
over the city. Stones were driven along, sand was whirled about, and all the
corpses arose from the ground, each holding his own head in his hands. They
rushed toward Cao Cao as if to strike him. The officials covered their eyes,
and none dared to look another in the face.
The power of a bold man will overturn a state,
The art of a necromancer also produces wonders.
Read the next chapter and you will know the fate of Cao Cao.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 69 ****
The sight of the corpses of his victims rising to their feet in the storm and
running toward him was too much for Cao Cao, and he swooned. However, the wind
quickly fell and the corpses disappeared. His followers assisted Cao Cao to his
palace, but he was very ill.
A poet celebrated the episode of the murdered Daoist:
He studied his magical books,
He was learned in mystical lore,
And with magical fleetness of foot
He could travel the wide world over.
The magical arts that he knew,
He employed in an earnest essay
To reform the bad heart of Cao Cao.
But in vain; Cao Cao held on his way.
Cao Caoâs illness seemed beyond the art of the physicians, and drugs seemed
of no avail. It happened that Minister Xu Zhi came from the capital to visit
the prince, who bade the latter take a cast from the âBook of Changesâ.
âHave you ever heard of Guan Lu? He is more than human in his skill at
divination,â said Xu Zhi.
âI have heard a lot about him, but I do not know how clever he is. You tell
me about him,â replied Cao Cao.
âHe is from Pingyuan. His face is ugly and coarse; he drinks to excess and is
rather dissipated. His father was an elder of Langye. Since a lad Guan Lu loved
to study the stars, staying up all night to watch them, in spite of the
prohibition of his father and mother. He used to say that if domestic fowls and
wild geese knew the seasons naturally, how much more should humans. He often
used to play with other children at drawing pictures of the sky on the ground,
putting in the sun, moon, and stars. When he grew older he studied the âBook
of Changesâ very deeply and observed the winds. He was a marvelous calculator
and excellent physiognomist.
âHis fame reached the ears of Shan Zichun, the Governor of Langye, who called
him to his residence for an interview. There were present some hundred or so
other guests, everyone of whom could be called able of speech.
ââI am young and not over-bold,â said Guan Lu to the Governor. âI pray
you give me three flasks of wine to loosen my tongue.â The request was
astonishing, but the wine was brought in, and when he had drunk it, Guan Lu,
looking contemptuously at the other guests, said, âNow I am ready. Are these
the opponents you have got together for me to contend with? Are these gentlemen
sitting around me disputants?â
ââI myself am anxious for a match with you,â said Shan Zichun. Then they
began upon the meaning of the Book of Changes. Guan Luâs words poured forth
like a torrent, and his ideas were most recondite. The Governor replied,
stating difficulties; Guan Lu swept them away in a stream of eloquence. So it
went on the whole day without a pause even for refreshment. Neither Shan Zichun
nor his other guests could help praising Guan Lu and agreeing with him.
âHis fame spread wide after this encounter, and people spoke of him as the
âSupernatural Boy.â After this he became famous in another way. There was a
certain Guo En, a common man, who had two brothers. All three became lame, and
they called in Guan Lu to cast lots and discover the reason. Guan Lu said,
âBy the lots there is a female demon in your family tomb, an aunt, the wife
of one of your fatherâs brothers. Some years ago, in a time of famine, for
the sake of a few carts of grain, she was pushed into a well and a great stone
was thrown in on her, crushing her head so that she suffered intensely. She
complained to the Most High, and your lameness is the retribution for that
crime. No prayers will avert the evil.â The three brothers wept and
acknowledged their guilt.
âGovernor Wang Ji of Anping, heard of the divinerâs fame and invited him to
come on a visit, and he went. It happened that another guest of the Governor
was the magistrate of Xindu, whose wife suffered from headaches and his son
from pains in the heart. Guan Lu was asked to discover the reason. He cast lots
and said that at the west corner of the main hall there were buried two
corpses, one of a man who held a spear, the other of a man who had a bow and
arrows. The wall was built across them. The spearmanâs master had gashed his
head, and so his head pained. The archerâs master had stabbed him in the
heart, and so his heart suffered anguish. They dug where Guan Lu indicated and,
about eight spans down, found two coffins, one with a spear inside and the
other with a strung bow and wooden arrows. All were much decayed. Guan Lu bade
them remove the bones and bury them three miles outside the walls. Thereafter
the woman and her son suffered no more.
âA certain Zhuge Yuan, Magistrate of Guantao, newly promoted to Governor, was
leaving for his new post, and Guan Lu went to see him off. One of the guests
mentioned that Guan Lu could divine what was hidden from sight. The Governor
doubted such powers and said he would put a test. He got a swallowâs egg, a
waspâs nest, and a spider, and concealed them in three separate boxes. He
asked Guan Lu to guess the contents. The divination made, Guan Lu wrote three
quatrains:
âThe latent life will declare itself;
It will cling to your lordly hall,
Or male or female, flung into space,
Wide wings will prevent its fall.
This seems to indicate a swallowâs egg.
âA many-chambered dwelling
Is hanging to your eaves.
Each room has a poisonous tenant;
Whoâll be flying when he leaves.
This answers to a waspâs nest.
âTherein is a long-legged, trembling thing,
Who spins a thread from his inside
And spreads a fine spun net for flies;
He profits most at eventide.
And this it a spider.â
âThe guests were amazed.
âAn old woman in his village having lost a cow, came to consult him. After
the divination, he told her that seven men had taken away the cow and were
cooking and eating it on the bank of a certain mountain stream. She had better
go there quickly and see who they were. If she went with all speed, she would
find the skin and the flesh. The woman went and found the seven men hidden
behind a small shanty, boiling beef. Most of the cowâs flesh was still there.
She told Governor Liu Bin, who arrested the seven men and punished them. Then
the Governor asked the old lady how she got to know exactly who the offenders
were, and she told him.
âGovernor Liu Bin was dubious, too. He sent for Guan Lu and put him to the
following test. He placed his seal and a pheasant feather in a box and asked
what were the contents. The reply was:
âSquare within, without so round,
Beauteous colors here abound;
The jewel within is held secure
And what it witnesses is sure.
Is not this a seal in its bag?
âThereâs a bird on the precipice steep,
Its body with flame seems aglow.
Its wings are barred yellow and black.
At sunrise it never fails to crow.
And I think this hints at a pheasant feather.
âGovernor Liu Bin treated the marvelous diviner with great honor.
âOne day Guan Lu saw a youth plowing a field. After watching him for a long
time, Guan Lu suddenly asked his name and age. The young man said, âMy name
is Zhao Yang, and I am nineteen. Pray, who may you be, Sir?â
ââI am Guan Lu; you may have heard of me. I see an air of early death about
you, and you will be done with life in three days. It is a pity that one so
handsome should die so young.â
âZhao Yang forsook his plow, hurried home and told his father. The father at
once set out to find Guan Lu, and, having found Guan Lu, threw himself on the
ground and besought the diviner to save his son.
ââHow can I avert the doom? It is fate,â said Guan Lu.
ââAlas! I have but this one son, I pray you save him.â
âAnd the son added his tears and prayers to those of his father. Guan Lu was
deeply touched. Then he turned to the lad and said, âYou get ready some good
wine and some venison. Tomorrow go into the forest on the south there, and
underneath a lofty tree you will see two men seated on boulders playing chess.
One of them will be dressed in white, and he will be facing the south. He is
very evil looking. The other will be seated opposite, dressed in red. He is
very handsome. They will be deeply absorbed in their game and will not notice
who offers them food and wine, which you will humbly present on your knees.
When they have eaten and drunk, you will prostrate yourself and with tears pray
them to grant you length of days. You will gain an increased span of life, but,
above all things, do not mention that I told you what to do.â
âThe father kept Guan Lu as a guest, and the next day the son followed out
his instructions. He entered the forest and soon came upon the two men seated
beneath a pine, playing chess. They seemed oblivious to all around them. Zhao
Yang presented the wine and the food, and the two men ate absent-mindedly, for
the game went on. But when Zhao Yang threw himself on the ground and implored
the gift of long life, they seemed startled.
ââThis must be some of Guan Luâs doing,â said Red Robe. âStill, as we
have accepted a gift at his hand, we must have pity on him.â
âHe who was dressed in white then lifted up a book that hung at his side and
looked therein.
ââYou are nineteen this year,â said White Dress to Zhao Yang. âYou
ought to die. But we will insert a number nine over the number one and so make
it read ninety-nine, and that is the age you will attain. But when you go back,
tell Guan Lu he is not to betray the secrets of fate, or Heaven will surely
punish him.â
âThen Red Robe took out a pen and added the figure. A gust of wind passed,
and the two old men were transformed into two cranes that rose into the sky and
flew away. Zhao Yang came back home and told what he had seen. Guan Lu told him
the red-robed man was the Southern Dipper Constellation, and the white-robed,
the Northern Dipper.
ââBut the Northern Dipper consists of nine stars, and there was only one
man,â objected the lad.
ââSeparately they are nine, but they combine to form one. The Northern
Dipper records deaths; the Southern Dipper, births. Now the extra figure has
been added, you need have no anxiety. You will live long.
âFather and son both thanked him most sincerely, but thereafter Guan Lu was
very careful how he divined for people lest he should betray celestial secrets.
âNow, this man is at Pingyuan, and you, O Prince, can seek your fate of him.
Why not call him?â
Cao Cao was greatly glad. Guan Lu was sent for and came. As soon as the
salutations were over, Cao Cao asked him to cast lots for him.
Guan Lu at once found the cause and said, âYour illness is only due to
magical machinations. It should not create anxiety.â
Cao Cao was much relieved in his mind, and his health began to improve. Next
Cao Cao wished to know about the conditions in the empireâs affairs.
After the necessary calculations the prophet said:
ï¿½Three and eight cross;
Where the army halt,
The yellow boar meets the tiger;
It causes the loss of one limb.â
Then Cao Cao asked him to inquire whether his life should be long or not.
Guan Lu replied:
âIn the Lion Palace
The talents of ancestors are preserved.
The Princeâs way is securely renewed,
And his son and grandson shall come to high honor.â
Then Cao Cao asked concerning himself.
âDivination concerning the fate of the universe may not be foreknown. Wait a
time and I will look into it.â
Cao Cao was pleased and would like to keep such a man near him, so he offered
him the post of Historiographer (who was also soothsayer) at his court, but it
was declined.
âMy destiny is mean, my luck despicable. I am not equal to such an office and
dare not undertake it,â said Guan Lu.
âWhy not?â said Cao Cao.
âMy forehead has no lofty fullness; my eyes no steady expression; my nose no
bridge; my feet no round, solid heels; my back lacks the triple armor (of
shoulder blades and intervening muscles); and my breast the three marks (like
the character indicating wealth). I can only control evil spirits securely; I
cannot rule living humans.â
âWhat think you of my physiognomy?â
âWhat can a minister of extremely exalted rank like yourself desire
further?â said Guan Lu.
Cao Cao pressed him to say. The soothsayer only laughed. Then Cao Cao asked him
to look at the many officers of all kinds standing around.
âEveryone of them is a servant equal to the administration of the empire,â
said Guan Lu.
But when Cao Cao asked whether good or bad fortune was to be his, the
soothsayer would not give a clear and full reply.
A poem says:
Guan Lu was a seer of old.
Stars to him their secrets told.
Mysteries, occult and dim,
Were as daylight unto him.
His so subtle intellect
Could the shade of death detect,
But the secrets of his skill
Died with him â -are secrets still.
Again Cao Cao asked him to divine concerning his rivals Wu and Shu.
Guan Lu said, âThe south just lost a famous leader, and the west is
encroaching on your territory.â
Cao Caoâs doubts as to the accuracy of one of these events were soon set at
rest, for a messenger came from Hefei to report: âLu Su, the Commander-in-
Chief of the South Land, has died in Lukou.â
Then Cao Cao sent hurriedly into Hanzhong, and the scout returned to report:
âZhang Fei and Ma Chao have taken the Xiabian Pass and are threatening
Hanzhong.â
Cao Cao was angry and inclined to march at once against the invaders. But he
consulted the great soothsayer, who advised him not to move.
âDo not act in haste. In the coming spring there will be a conflagration in
Xuchang,â said Guan Lu.
Having been witness of the verification of Guan Luâs words, Cao Cao was in no
mood to neglect the warning. He stayed on in his palace, but he sent Cao Hong
with fifty thousand troops to assist in the defense of East River Land, while
Xiahou Dun, with thirty thousand troops, went to Xuchang to keep careful watch
and be ready against any surprises. He placed High Minister Wang Bi in command
of the Imperial Guard.
Sima Yi warned Cao Cao against this Wang Bi, saying, âThe man is given to
wine, and slack. He is not a fit person for such a post.â
Cao Cao replied, âHe is very fit. He has followed me through all difficulties
and dangers. He is loyal and diligent, solid as stone or iron.â
Wang Bi was appointed and led the guard into camp at the capital, outside the
East Gate of the Imperial Palace.
Now there was a certain Geng Ji, a Luoyang man, who had long been employed in
the Prime Ministerâs palace in a subordinate capacity and afterward had been
promoted to a post of Minister. He and Minister Wei Huang were close friends.
These two were greatly distressed at Cao Caoâs advance to princely rank, and
more especially at his use of the imperial chariots. In the early months of the
twenty-third year (AD 218), Geng Ji and Wei Huang came to a secret exchange of
views on Cao Caoâs conduct.
Geng Ji said, âThe man is rebellious and wicked, every day behaving worse. He
intends to go farther, and how can we, as servants of the dynasty, help him in
his wickedness?â
Wei Huang said, âI have a friend named Jin Yi, who also is a servant of Han
and an enemy of Cao Caoâs . He is a descendant of the old Great Minister Jin
Midi. Beside, he is friendly with Wang Bi. If we all tried our best, we ought
to succeed.â
âBut if he is friendly with Wang Bi, he will not assist us!â said Geng Ji.
âLet us go and sound him,â said Wei Huang.
So the two went to see Jin Yi, who received them in his private rooms. There
they talked.
Said Wei Huang, âO virtuous Jin Yi, we know you are on most friendly terms
with Commander Wang Bi, and so have come to beg a favor.â
âWhat is it you ask?â
âThe Prince of Wei will soon receive the abdication of the Emperor and
himself ascend to the seat of the mighty. Then you and your friend Wang Bi will
advance to places of great honor. When that day comes, we pray you not forget
us, but recommend us for employment. We should feel no shallow gratitude for
your kindness.â
Jin Yi flicked down his sleeves and arose looking very angry. At that instant
arrived the tea for the visitors. He snatched it away from the serving man and
emptied it on the floor.
Wei Huang started up in feigned alarm.
âHow have I offended you, my good friend?â cried he.
âI have been friends with you because you are descendants of people who have
served the Hans faithfully. Now, instead of trying to repay the debt of
gratitude you ought to feel, you turn aside to assist one who is their enemy,
think you that I can regard you as friends? How could I look the world in the
face?â
âBut if it be destiny, one cannot help it,â said Geng Ji. âOne must
accept it.â
Jin Yi grew still more angry, so that the two visitors were convinced that at
heart he was loyal to the dynasty. Then they began to tell him the true state
of the case.
Said they, âOur real desire is to destroy this rebel, and we have come to ask
your help in that. What we said at first was only a test to find out what you
thought.â
âThink you, with my ancestry, generation after generation in the confidence
and service of the Hans, that I would willingly follow a rebel? If you, Sirs,
really think of restoring the dynasty, pray tell me your plans.â
âThough we have the desire to prove our gratitude, yet we lack the means to
destroy the enemy,â said Wei Huang.
Said Jin Yi, âWe desire helpers within and supporters without. If we could
slay Wang Bi, we could use his name and troops to help the Emperor. With the
help of Liu Bei, the Imperial Uncle, we should be able to destroy the rebel Cao
Cao.â
Hearing Jin Yiâs plan, the others clapped their hands in approval.
âAnd I have two friends outside of the city who will go with us,â said Jin
Yi. âBoth of them have the murder of a father to avenge. We can get their
helps.â
âWho are they?â
âThey are sons of the great physician Ji Ping and are called Ji Mao and Ji
Mu. Cao Cao put their father to death for his connection with the plot
organized by Dong Cheng, when Dong Cheng received the secret edict conveyed in
the robe and girdle, which was conferred upon him by the Emperor. The two sons
escaped that time by flight, but they have since secretly returned to the
capital. With their help all will go well.â
Geng Ji and Wei Huang rejoiced at the prospect of further help, and a messenger
was sent to call in the two Ji brothers. Soon they arrived, and the plot was
laid before them. They were deeply affected and shed copious tears. Their wrath
rose to the sky, and they swore to aid in the destruction of the rebel.
âOn the fifteenth day of the first month there will be grand illuminations in
the city,â said Jin Yi, âand felicitations will continue on every side.
Geng Ji and Wei Huang will each lead out their retainers and make their way
quickly to Wang Biâs camp to wait till they see the fire begin. Then they
will dash in, slay Wang Bi, and follow me inside the Palace. We will then
request the Emperor to ascend the Tower of the Five Phoenixes, assemble his
officers, and issue orders to destroy the rebels. The two Ji brothers will make
their way into the city and set fires going. Then all will raise their voices
and summon the populace to their aid. They are to hold up any rescue force in
the city till the Emperor has issued the edict and disturbance is allayed, when
they will rush toward Yejun and seize Cao Cao. Then a messenger will be
dispatched with a summons for Liu Bei, the Imperial Uncle. We will begin our
work that night at the second watch, and we will escape the ill success that
attended Dong Chengâs attempt.â
All five swore before Heaven to be true, and they smeared their lips with blood
in earnest of their oath. After this, each returned to his own home to prepare
arms and call up their people.
Geng Ji and Wei Huang each had four or five hundred retainers, whom they armed.
Ji Mao and Ji Mu also got together three hundred men. They gave out a story of
a hunting party to explain the gathering.
When the preparations were complete, and before the time fixed for the rising,
Jin Yi went to see Wang Bi.
Said Jin Yi, âEverything in the world seems now tranquil, and the power of
the Prince of Wei extends over all the land. It is a season of joy and
felicitation, and you can organize a lantern festivity, and people shall hang
out lanterns and put up decorations for the occasion.â
So Wang Bi issued guidelines for a Feast of Lanterns in the city. The night of
full moon was very clear, moon and stars most brilliant. The people of the
capital took advantage of the night and thronged the streets and the market
places. The lanterns were hung out in profusion, and all went merrily.
No official interfered with the crowd;
No one thought of the flight of time;
All was simple gaiety.
That night the Commander of the Imperial Guards, Wang Bi, and his officers had
a feast in their camp. Just after the second watch had begun, they heard a
great shouting in the camp, and someone came in to say that a fire had started
in the rear. Wang Bi hurriedly left the table and went outside. He saw flames
leaping up and rolling by and heard shouts of âKill!â rising on every side
and echoing to the very sky. He thought the camp had certainly mutinied, and,
jumping on his horse, went out at the south gate. Just outside he ran against
Geng Ji, who loosed an arrow which struck him in the shoulder. He nearly fell
with the shock, but he got away toward the west gate. He found he was pursued
by armed men, so he got flurried, dismounted, and went on foot. Presently he
came to the house of Jin Yi and hammered at the door.
Now the fire that had created such a scare had been raised by Jin Yiâs own
people sent for that purpose, and Jin Yi had followed them to fight when the
time came. Hence there was no one but the woman folks left in his house. When
the women heard the clamor at the door, they thought Jin Yi had come back.
Jin Yiâs wife, from the door of the womenâs quarter, called out, âHave
you killed Wang Bi?â
This was a shock, but it told Wang Bi that his quondam friend was now an enemy.
Wherefore Wang Bi fled further to the house of Cao Xiu and told him, âGeng Ji
and Jin Yi have raised a disturbance.â
Cao Xiu immediately armed himself, got to horse, and led out a thousand troops.
He found fires on all sides, and the Tower of the Five Phoenixes was in flames.
The Emperor had fled into the recesses of the Palace, but Cao Caoâs friends
and partisans were defending the Palace gates like grim death.
In the city the crowd was shouting one to another: âSlay Cao Cao and restore
the Hans!â
When Xiahou Dun had received thirty thousand troops and the command to keep
watch and ward over the capital, he had gone into camp three miles from the
city. When he saw the conflagration start, he set the army in motion and
surrounded the city. He also sent reinforcements to Cao Xiu within.
Inside the city the fighting went on all night. No one joined the conspirators;
the small band were left to their own efforts. Soon it was reported that Jin
Yi, Ji Mao, and Ji Mu were slain. Geng Ji and Wei Huang found their way to one
of the gates, but there they met Xiahou Dunâs main force and were made
prisoners. The handful of men with them were cut to pieces.
When the fighting subsided, Xiahou Dun went into the city and set his troops to
put out the fires. He also laid hands on the whole households of the five
conspirators. Then he sent a report to Cao Cao, who sent back orders to execute
the two conspirators and put to death in public all the members of the five
families. He was also to arrest every official and send the whole batch to
Yejun for interrogations.
Xiahou Dun sent his two chief prisoners to the place of execution. They shouted
against Cao Cao.
âLiving we have failed to slay you, Cao Cao. Dead we will be malicious
spirits smiting rebels in all places!â
The executioner smote Geng Ji on the mouth with his sword, so that the blood
gushed out, but he continued to shout as long as he could.
Wei Huang, his fellow-conspirator, dashed his temples on the ground, crying,
âHow I hate him!â and ground his teeth till he broke them to fragments. And
they both died of hatred and exhaustion.
Who can with outstretched hands uphold the sky
Or thrones maintain by simple loyalty?
Hanâs day was done; two would avert the doom,
But failed, and carried anger to the tomb.
Xiahou Dun carried out his chiefâs orders and sent the officials he had
arrested to Yejun. There Cao Cao set up two flags, one red and one white, in
the drill ground and sent all the officials thither. Then he addressed them.
âIn this late rebellion some of you went out to extinguish the fire, some of
you stayed within doors. Let those who went forth to put out the fire take
their stand by the red flag, and those who remained in their houses go to the
white flag.â
The officials thought within themselves, âCertainly there can be nothing
wrong in trying to put out a fire,â so they nearly all placed themselves
under the red flag. Only about a third went to the white.
Then the order was given to seize all those by the red flag.
They protested. âWe are guiltless!â cried they.
Cao Cao said, âAt that time you intended not to put out the flames but to aid
the rebels.â
He sent them all down to River Zhang and had them put to death on the bank.
There were more than three hundred victims. He rewarded those who were under
the white flag and sent them to their homes in the capital.
Wang Bi died from his wound and was buried with great honor.
Cao Xiu was placed over the guards; Zhong Yao was created Prime Minister of the
princedom of Wei; Hua Xin became High Minister. The occasion was taken to
create six grades of the title of Lordship with three divisions each, eighteen
in all. There were seventeen grades of Marquis West of the Pass. And all these
had golden seals of office with purple ribbons. There were also sixteen ranks
of Interior Marquis and Exterior Marquis. They had silver seals with tortoise
ornaments on the back and black ribbons. There were five classes of Minister
with three grades in each class. These had brass seals, with chain ornaments
and ribbons. And with all these various gradations of ranks and nobility
reorganized, the court was entirely reformed. There were new ranks and new
people in office.
Cao Cao then remembered the warning about a conflagration in the capital and
wished to reward Guan Lu for his prescience, but he would receive nothing.
Meanwhile, in East River Land, Cao Hong with an army of fifty thousand went
into Hanzhong. He placed Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He in command at points of
importance, while he went on to the attack. At that time Zhang Fei and Lei Tong
were holding Baxi. Ma Chao marched to Xiabian and sent Wu Lan out as Van Leader
to reconnoiter. He fell in with Cao Hong, and Wu Lan was going to retire. But
General Ren Kui advised against this.
Said Ren Kui, âThe enemy are newly arrived. Why not fight and take the keen
edge off their pride? If we do not fight, how can we look our chief in the face
when we return?â
So it was decided to offer battle, and Ren Kui rode out and challenged Cao
Hong. The challenge was accepted, and the warriors advanced. Cao Hong cut Ren
Kui down in the third encounter and pressed the advantage, and Wu Lan was
beaten off. When Wu Lan returned and told Ma Chao, he was blamed.
âWhy did you attack without orders and bring about this defeat?â
âIt was the fault of Ren Kui, who disobeyed orders.â
âDefend the Pass most carefully. Do not engage,â said Ma Chao.
Ma Chao sent a report to Capital Chengdu and awaited orders for a further
action. Cao Hong suspected some ruse when Ma Chao remained so long inactive,
and retired to Nanzheng.
Here he was visited by Zhang He, who asked, âGeneral, why did you retire
after the successful attack and slaughter of one of the enemy leaders?â
âSeeing that Ma Chao declined to come out to fight, I suspected some ruse,â
replied Cao Hong. âBeside, when I was at Yejun that wonderful soothsayer,
Guan Lu, foretold the loss of a leader here. I heeded what he said and so was
careful.â
Zhang He laughed, âYou have been a leader of soldiers for half your life, and
yet you heed the sayings of a soothsayer! I may be of small wit, but I would
take Baxi with my own troops, and the possession of Baxi would be the key to
the whole of Shu.â
âThe defender of Baxi is Zhang Fei,â said Cao Hong. âHe is no ordinary
man to meet. One must be careful.â
âAll of you fear this Zhang Fei, but I do not. I look upon him as a mere
nobody. I shall have to capture him this time.â
âBut if you fail, what then?â
âThen I shall be content to pay the penalty according to military rules.â
Cao Hong made him put his undertaking in writing, and then Zhang He marched to
the attack.
The proud are often defeat;
Lightsome attacks oft fail.
The following chapter will tell how Zhang He fared.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 70 ****
Zhang Heâs army, with which he felt so sure of victory, consisted of thirty
thousand troops, and they were in three camps â-Camp Dangqu, Camp Mengtou,
and Camp Dangshi â-which were protected by the hills. When Zhang He marched,
he left half the soldiers in each camp as defenders.
The news soon reached Baxi, and Zhang Fei called in his colleague Lei Tong to
give his opinion.
Lei Tong said, âThe country is bad and the hills full of danger in the area
of Langzhong. Let us lay an ambush. You, General, go out to give battle, and I
will help you by a sudden, unexpected attack. We ought to get Zhang He.â
Whereupon Zhang Fei gave five thousand troops to Lei Tong, and himself led out
ten thousand troops to a point ten miles from Langzhong. Having set them in
order, he rode out and challenge Zhang He to single combat. Zhang He galloped
out to meet him.
After the thirtieth or so bout, Zhang Heâs ranks suddenly began to shout and
soon showed signs of confusion. The reason was the appearance of the banners of
Shu from the cover of some hills. Zhang He dared not continue to fight, and he
fled. Zhang Fei pursued him. Lei Tong also appeared in his road and attacked,
and so, with enemies on both sides, Zhang He forced his way out and lost the
day. Both Zhang Fei and Lei Tong continued to smite him, even into the night,
till he got back to his camp at Dangqu.
Zhang He reverted to his old plan of defending the three camps, rolling down
logs and hurling stones. But he remained behind his defenses. Zhang Fei made a
camp three miles off.
Next day Zhang Fei went forth and offered battle, but Zhang He took no notice.
Zhang He ascended to the summit of the hill and drank wine to the accompaniment
of trumpets and drums, but he would not fight. Zhang Fei bade his soldiers
shout insults, but these had no effect. Lei Tong was sent up the hill, but the
rolling logs and hurtling stones forced him to retire. Then the defenders of
the other two camps came out to the attack, and Lei Tong was discomfited.
Next day Zhang Fei again offered battle, but there was no response. Again the
soldiers yelled every form of insult, but Zhang He from the hill top only
replied by similar abuse. Zhang Fei was at his witsâ ends; and this game was
played for more than fifty days.
Then Zhang Fei made a strong stockade just in front of the hill, and therein he
sat day after day drinking till he became half drunk. And when he was so, he
reviled his opponent.
About this time Liu Bei sent gifts to the army, and when the messenger went
back, he told Liu Bei that his brother was giving himself over to wine. This
made Liu Bei anxious, so he lost no time in asking advice from Zhuge Liang.
Zhuge Liang was jocular, saying, âSince that is so, let us send him fifty
vessels of the best brew of Chengdu. He probably has but poor stuff in the
camp.â
âBut he has always had a weakness for wine, and he has failed because of it.
Yet you would encourage him to drink by sending him more wine?â
âMy lord, is it that you do not understand your brother even after all these
years? He is brave and steady, yet when we first invaded West River Land, he
released Yan Yan, which was not what a mere brave would have done. He is face
to face with Zhang He, and has been for nearly two months, and day after day he
drinks and rages and insults his enemy openly. He treats Zhang He with most
perfect contempt. But this is not only the wine cup; it is a deep plan to get
the better of Zhang He.â
âThis may be so,â replied Liu Bei, âbut let us not rely upon it too much.
Let Wei Yan go to help him.â
Zhuge Liang sent Wei Yan with the wine, and the carts set out, each flying a
yellow flag with a writing in large characters: Fine Wine for the Frontier
Army.
When Wei Yan reached the army, he handed over the wine, which he said was a
gift from the Lord of Shu. And Zhang Fei received it with due respect.
Zhang Fei told Wei Yan and Lei Tong each to take a thousand troops and move out
on the two wings, ready to act when they saw a red flag displayed. And then he
had the wine laid out and called up some soldiers to drink with a great display
of flags and a rolling of drums.
The spies reported all these doings on the hill-top, and Zhang He came out to
look for himself. There he saw his opponent drinking, and two of the soldiers
were boxing before Zhang Fei for his amusement.
âHe despises me too much,â said Zhang He.
And Zhang He gave orders to prepare for a night attack on the enemy camp. His
own troops in Camp Dangqu should do the raiding, and those from Camp Mengtou
and Camp Dangshi were to support them.
There was little moon that night, and Zhang He took advantage of the obscurity
to steal down the side of the hill. He got quite close to the enemy camp and
stood for a time looking at Zhang Fei sitting amid a blaze of lamps and
drinking. Suddenly Zhang He dashed forward with a yell, and at the same moment
his drums on the hill-top rolled out their defiance. Zhang Fei never stirred.
Zhang He rushed at him and delivered a mighty thrust with his spear. Zhang Fei
toppled over â-it was a Zhang Fei of straw. Zhang He checked and turned his
steed. At that moment he heard a string of detonations, and a warrior appeared
before him barring his way. It was the real Zhang Fei, as the round head and
thundering voice speedily made manifest.
With the serpent halberd set, Zhang Fei rode toward Zhang He. The two warriors
fought many bouts under the gleaming lights. No help came to Zhang He. In vain
he yearned for the assistance, which the two camps were to bring him. He did
not know that his reinforcements had been driven back by Wei Yan and Lei Tong,
and that the two camps, Mengtou and Dangshi, were now in possession of his
enemies. As the help did not come, Zhang He was powerless; and, to add to his
discomfiture, the glare of fire out in the moutains of Dangqu told him of the
seizure of his third camp by Zhang Feiâs rear force. Nothing could be done,
and Zhang He cut an alley, forced out of the press, and fled to Wakou Pass. The
victory was all to Zhang Fei.
The news of the success delighted Liu Bei, and he knew then that Zhang Feiâs
drinking had been part of a stratagem to entice his enemy into the open and
defeat them.
Zhang He reached Wakou Pass, but with the loss of two-thirds of his army of
thirty thousand troops. He stood on defense and sent urgent messages to Cao
Hong to come to his rescue.
Cao Hong angrily replied, âHe disobeyed my orders and marched. He has lost an
important point and now he sends to me for help!â
While refusing aid, Cao Hong sent to urge his colleague to go out and fight.
But Zhang He too greatly feared.
At length Zhang He decided upon a plan of action. He sent out two parties into
ambush and said to them, âI will pretend defeat and fly. They will follow,
and you can cut off their retreat.â
When he did march out, he met Lei Tong. The two engaged in battle, and Zhang He
presently ran away. Lei Tong pursued and fell into the ambush. Then Zhang He
returned and slew Lei Tong. His troops went back and told Zhang Fei, who came
up to provoke another fight. Zhang He again tried his stratagem, but Zhang Fei
did not pursue. Again and again the ruse was tried, but Zhang Fei knew it was
only a ruse and simply retired to his own camp.
He said to Wei Yan, âZhang He has compassed the death of Lei Tong by leading
him into an ambush, and he wants to inveigle me into another. What say you to
meeting trick with trick?â
âBut how?â said Wei Yan.
âTomorrow I will lead the army forward, you following me with some reliable
soldiers. When his army come out from their ambush, you can smite them, sending
half your men against each party. We will secretly fill the by-roads with loads
of combustibles, entice the enemy among them and start a fire. In the
confusion, I shall try to capture Zhang He. So will we avenge our comradeâs
death.â
So Zhang Fei went out, and Zhang Heâs troops came and began to fight. After a
half score bouts, Zhang He ran away, and this time Zhang Fei pursued. Zhang He,
now fleeing, now stopping to exchange a blow or two, led Zhang Fei through the
hills to a valley. Here, suddenly changing front to rear and rear to front,
Zhang He halted, made a camp, and offered battle.
It was now the time when Zhang He expected his hidden troops to appear and
surround Zhang Fei. But none appeared. He knew not that his ambush had been
broken up by Wei Yanâs army and driven into the valley where the road was
filled with cartloads of combustibles, and that the valley even then was all
aflame.
Then Zhang Fei came to the attack, and the rout was complete. Zhang He,
fighting desperately, got through to the Wakou Pass and there mustered the
remnant of his force. He strengthened the position and remained behind his
ramparts.
Zhang Fei and Wei Yan then tried to take the Pass, but day after day they
failed. Zhang Fei, seeing no hope of success, retired seven miles and
bivouacked. From this point he sent out scouts under Wei Yan to explore the
country. While going along, they observed some burden-bearers, men and women,
going up a very retired path, pulling down the creepers, and pushing aside the
grasses.
âThat is the way to take Wakou Pass,â cried Zhang Fei, pointing with his
whip to the wayfarers.
He ordered his soldiers not to scare the people, but to call a few gently and
bring them to him. They soon had several standing before their leader, who
spoke to them kindly and put them at ease.
âWhence come you?â asked Zhang Fei.
âWe belong to Hanzhong and are going home. We heard that you were out
fighting and the high road to Langzhong was blockaded, and so we have come
across the Mist Torrent and Zitong Mountains and down River Guijin. We are
going to our homes in Hanzhong.â
âCan one reach Wakou Pass by this road? And how far is it?â
The country people replied, âA small road leads past to the rear of the Pass
from Zitong Mountains.â
For this piece of information Zhang Fei rewarded them by taking them into his
camp and giving them a good meal. Then he sent off Wei Yan to make a frontal
attack on the Pass, while he himself with five hundred light horse attacked it
from the rear by way of Mount Zitong.
Zhang He was grieved and disappointed that Cao Hong sent no help, and the news
of Wei Yanâs attack only added to his sorrow. But he girded on his armor and
was about to ride out when they told him that fires had started at half a dozen
places behind the Pass. They most likely indicated soldiers. However, he went
out to meet them, and, to his horror, when the flags opened out, his eyes fell
on the figure of Zhang Fei. Away he ran along a by-road.
But his steed was not fast, and as Zhang Fei pressed him close, Zhang He
dismounted and ran up the mountain side. So Zhang He escaped. He had, however,
some ten followers, and it was a small and dejected party that presently found
its way into Nanzheng. He saw Cao Hong, and Cao Hong was very angry at his
plight.
âI told you not to go, but you were willful. And you gave in your written
pledge. You have lost all your soldiers, yet you do not commit suicide. What
will you do next?â
Cao Hong ordered the lictors to put Zhang He to death. But Marching General Guo
Huai, interceded.
âAn army is easily raised; a leader is hard to find. Though Zhang He is
guilty, he is a great favorite with our prince. I think you should spare him.
Rather give him command of another army and send him to take Jiameng Pass and
so hold up the soldiers at all the stations. Hanzhong will be tranquil of its
own accord. If he fails a second time, you can punish him for both faults.â
Cao Hong was satisfied to do this, and instead of dealing with his fault, he
gave Zhang He five thousand troops and told him to take Jiameng Pass.
The Commanders of the Pass were Meng Da and Huo Jun. They were at variance â-
Meng Da desiring to go out to meet Zhang He, but Huo Jun being in favor of
defense. Meng Da being set on having his way went out, gave battle, and was
defeated. Huo Jun reported this to the capital, where Liu Bei at once called in
the Directing Instructor to ask advice. Zhuge Liang assembled all the chief
generals into the hall.
âJiameng Pass is in danger. We must get Zhang Fei from Langzhong to drive off
Zhang He,â said Zhuge Liang.
Fa Zheng replied, âZhang Fei is encamped at Wakou Pass, and Langzhong is no
less important than Jiameng Pass. I do not think he should be recalled. Choose
one among the generals to go and defeat Zhang He.â
Zhuge Liang laughed, âZhang He is renowned in Wei. No ordinary leader will
avail. Zhang Fei is the only man to send, the only one equal to the task.â
Then among the generals one started up crying angrily, âInstructor, why do
you thus despise us? I will use what little skill I have in slaying our enemy
and will lay his head at the foot of our standard.â
The speaker was Veteran General Huang Zhong, and all eyes centered on him.
âFriend Huang Zhong, you are bold enough, but what about your age? I fear you
are no match for Zhang He.â
Huang Zhongâs white beard bristled, and he said, âI know I am old. But
these two arms can still pull the four-hundred-fifty-pound bow, and the vigor
of my body is not yet departed. Am I not strong enough to meet such a poor
thing as Zhang He?â
âGeneral, you are nearly seventy. Can you still hold you are not aged?â
Huang Zhong tore down the hall. Seizing one of the great swords off the rack,
he whirled it as if it flew. And the stiffest bow that hung on the wall, he
pulled till it snapped.
âWell, if you will go, who will second you?â said Zhuge Liang.
âI would prefer Veteran General Yan Yan. And if there is the least anxiety,
well, here is this hoary head.â
Liu Bei was pleased to let these two go to fight Zhang He. However, Zhao Zilong
put in a protest.
âZhang He has already got through Jiameng Pass, so that the fighting will be
no childâs play, and the loss of that Pass endangers the whole of Yizhou. It
is no task to set to a couple of old men.â
Replied Zhuge Liang, âYou regard the two as too old to succeed, but I think
the attainment of Hanzhong depends upon these two.â
Zhao Zilong and many others sniggered as they went from the hall. They did not
agree with Zhuge Liang.
In due course the two Veteran Generals arrived at the Pass.
At sight of them, Meng Da and Huo Jun, the defenders of the Pass, laughed in
their hearts, thinking: âZhuge Liang has slipped up in his calculations in
sending such a pair of dotards on such an important mission.â
Huang Zhong said to Yan Yan, âYou see the behavior of these people? They are
laughing at us because we are old. Now we will do something that will win
admiration from all the world.â
âI should be glad to hear your orders,â replied Yan Yan.
The two generals came to a decision how to act. Huang Zhong led his army down
below to meet Zhang He in the open plain. Both drew up their array. When Zhang
He rode out and saw his venerable opponent, he laughed in his face.
âYou must be very old, and yet you are unashamed to go into the battle,
eh?â said Zhang He.
âYou menial!â replied the veteran. âDo you despise me for my age? You
will find my good sword, however, keen enough.â
So he urged forward his steed and rode at Zhang He. The two chargers met and a
score of bouts were fought. Then suddenly a great shouting came from the rear.
Yan Yan had come up and fallen upon the rear portion of Zhang Heâs army. Thus
attacked on two sides, Zhang He was defeated. The pursuit did not cease with
nightfall, and Zhang He was driven back near thirty miles. Contented with this
success, Huang Zhong and Yan Yan went into their camp, where they rested their
soldiers for a time.
When Cao Hong heard of Zhang Heâs new defeat, he was going to exact the
penalty. But Guo Huai persuaded him to forbear.
âIf he is pressed too hard, he may take refuge in Shu,â said Guo Huai.
âRather send him help. You will thus keep a hold over him and prevent his
desertion.â
Wherefore Xiahou Shang and Han Hao were sent with reinforcements. Xiahou Shang
was a nephew of Xiahou Dun, and Han Hao was the brother of Han Xuan, the late
Governor of Changsha. They had five thousand troops.
The two generals soon reached Zhang He, and asked how now the situation was
going.
âThat old man Huang Zhong is really a hero,â said Zhang He, âand with Yan
Yanâs help he is very formidable.â
âWhen I was at Changsha, I heard the old man was very fierce. He and Wei Yan
yielded the city to Liu Bei and killed my own brother. Now that I shall meet
him, I can have my revenge,â said Han Hao.
So he and Xiahou Shang led out the new army.
Now, by means of spies Huang Zhong had got a thorough knowledge of the country.
Yan Yan said, âHereabout there is a mountain named Tiandang Mountain wherein
Cao Hong has stored his supplies. If we can gain its possession, we shall
reduce the enemy to want and we shall get Hanzhong.â
Huang Zhong replied, âI think so, too, and so let us do so and so.â
Yan Yan agreed with him and marched off with a body of troops to carry out his
part in the stratagem.
At news of the coming of new armies, Huang Zhong marched out to meet them. He
found Han Hao in front of his array, and Han Hao began to abuse the veteran,
shouting out, âDisgraceful old ruffian!â
Then Han Hao whipped up his steed and set his spear at Huang Zhong. Xiahou
Shang also rode out and took part in the combat. The veteran held them both at
bay for some half score bouts and then fled. They pursued him for seven miles,
when they reached and seized his camp. Huang Zhong, however, quickly made
another defense of brushwood. Next day Xiahou Shang and Han Hao renewed the
pursuit, which ended with the capture of the temporary camp of the day before.
And they had advanced seven miles further. Then they called upon Zhang He to
protect the rear camp. When Zhang He came up, he dissuaded them from
continuing.
âHuang Zhong has retreated before you for two days. There is some deep
stratagem behind this,â said Zhang He.
Xiahou Shang scoffed at him, saying, âYou are such a coward that you have
been defeated many times. Now say no more, but let us accomplish something.â
Zhang He retired much mortified and shamed. Next day the two generals again
went out to battle, and again Huang Zhong fled from them for seven miles. The
two generals pursued as quickly as they could. The day after, Huang Zhong fled
without any pretense of showing fight, except at short intervals. He got to
Jiameng Pass and went on the defensive. The pursuers knocked at the very gate
of the Pass and made a camp close by.
Then Meng Da secretly wrote to Liu Bei that Huang Zhong had been repeatedly
defeated and now was in the Pass and unable to go out.
Liu Bei became alarmed and consulted Zhuge Liang, who said, âThe old general
is making the enemy over-confident â-to their ultimate destruction.â
But Zhao Zilong did not share this opinion, nor did many others, and Liu Bei
decided to send Liu Feng to reinforce his aged general.
The young man came to the Pass and saw Huang Zhong, who asked him, âGeneral,
what makes you come here?â
âMy father heard that you have sustained several defeats, and he has sent
me,â said Liu Feng.
âBut I am only employing the ruse of leading on the enemy,â said Huang
Zhong, smiling. âYou will see tonight that in one battle I shall regain all
the camps and capture their supplies and many horses. I have only lent the
camps to them to store their supplies. Tonight I shall leave Huo Jun to guard
the Pass, while General Meng Da will gather up the spoils for us. Now, young
Sir, you shall see the destruction of the enemy.â
That same night, at the second watch, Huang Zhong left the Pass with five
thousand troops. But now Xiahou Shang and Han Hao, seeing no move from the Pass
for many days, had become careless and so their camps were unable to resist.
Their troops had no time to don their armors or to saddle their horses. All the
leaders did was to flee for their lives, while their troops trampled each other
down and were killed in great numbers. All three camps were recovered by dawn,
and in them were found all sorts of military equipment. Horses and their
caparisons also fell to the victors, and all the booty was carried off by Meng
Da and stored in the Pass.
Huang Zhong pressed on his victory. Liu Feng ventured to say, âOur soldiers
need repose.â
âCan you seize the tigerâs whelps without going into the tigerâs den?â
cried Huang Zhong. And he urged on his steed. The soldiers also were eager.
Zhang Heâs own army was thrown into confusion by the flying men from the
defeated armies, and he could not maintain his station, but was forced to
retreat. They abandoned all their stockades and rushed to the bank of River
Han.
Then Zhang He sought the two generals who had brought about the misfortune and
said to them, âThis is Tiandang Mountain, where our stores are. Close by is
Micang Mountain. The two mountains are the very source of life of the Hanzhong
army. Lose them, and Hanzhong is gone too. We must see to their security.â
Xiahou Shang said, âMy uncle, Xiahou Yuan, will look out for the defense of
Micang Mountain, which is next to his station at Dingjun Mountain; there need
be no anxiety about that. And my brother, Xiahou De, guards Tiandang Mountain.
Let us go to him and help to protect that.â
Zhang He and the two generals set out at once. They reached the mountain and
told Xiahou De all that had happened.
âI have one hundred thousand troops in camp here,â replied he. âYou may
take some of them and recover your lost camps.â
âNo,â replied Zhang He. âThe only proper course is to defend.â
Almost as they spoke the rolling of drums and the clang of gongs were heard,
and the look-outs came to say that Huang Zhong was near.
âThe old ruffian does not know much of the art of war,â said Xiahou De with
a laugh. âAfter all, he is only a brave.â
âBe not mistaken: He is crafty and not only bold,â said Zhang He.
âThis move is against the rules and not at all crafty. He is worn from a long
march and his soldiers are fatigued, and they are deep in an enemyâs
country.â
âNevertheless, be careful how you attack,â said Zhang He. âYou would
still do well to depend upon defense only.â
âGive me three thousand good soldiers, and I will cut him to pieces,â cried
Han Hao.
They told off the three companies for him, and down he went into the plain. As
he approached, Huang Zhong arrayed his army.
Liu Feng put in a note of warning, saying, âThe sun is setting, and our men
are weary. Let us retire for the fight tomorrow.â
But Huang Zhong paid little attention, saying, âI do not hold with your
objections. This is the one God-given opportunity to make good, and it would be
a sin not to take it.â
So saying, the drums rolled for a great attack. Han Hao came forward with his
troops, and the aged general went toward him whirling his sword. In the first
encounter Han Hao fell. At this the soldiers of Shu gave a yell and went away
up the hill, whereupon Zhang He and Xiahou Shang hastily moved out to withstand
them. But a great red glare sprang into the sky from behind the hill, and a
shouting arose. Hastily Xiahou De led off his troops to meet the danger there
and went straight into the arms of Yan Yan. The Veteran Generalâs arm rose,
the sword fell, and Xiahou De dropped from his steed to rise no more.
This ambush, into which the dead general had rushed, had been carefully
prepared by Huang Zhong, who had sent Yan Yan away before he marched himself
and given Yan Yan orders what to do. It was the brushwood that Yan Yanâs men
had spent the time in collecting that now sent forth the flames reaching up to
the heavens and filling the valleys.
Yan Yan, after slaying Xiahou De, came round the hill to aid in the attack so
that the defenders were taken both in front and rear. They could do nothing and
presently left the battlefield and rushed toward Dingjun Mountain to seek
refuge with Xiahou Yuan.
Meanwhile the victors took steps to hold the position they had won and sent the
good news of victory to Capital Chengdu. And when the news arrived, Liu Bei
called together all his officers to rejoice.
Then said Fa Zheng, âNot long ago Zhang Lu submitted to Cao Cao, and thereby
Cao Cao got possession of Hanzhong quite easily. Instead of following up this
by an advance westward, he left two generals to guard it and went south. That
was a mistake. Now, my lord, do not make a mistake yourself, but take advantage
of the present favorable position, with Zhang He newly defeated and Tiandang
Mountain captured, to attack Hanzhong and you will have it at once. Once that
is yours, you can train your army and amass supplies ready for a stroke against
the arch-rebel himself. This God-given advantage will be confirmed to you, and
you should not miss it.â
Both Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang saw the wisdom of this scheme and prepared to act.
Zhao Zilong and Zhang Fei were to lead the van, while Liu Bei with Zhuge Liang
commanded the main army of one hundred thousand troops. A day was chosen to set
out, and orders were sent to everyone to keep careful guard for Yizhou.
It was a certain auspicious day in the seventh month of the twenty-third year
that the army marched (AD 218). Reaching Jiameng Pass, Huang Zhong and Yan Yan
were summoned and well rewarded for their services.
Liu Bei said to Huang Zhong, âPeople said you were old, General, but the
Directing Instructor of the army know you better than they, and you have
rendered amazing service. Still, Dingjun Mountain is yet to be captured, and it
is both a great central store and a major defense of Nanzheng. If we could get
Dingjun Mountain, we could be quite easy about the whole region of Hanzhong.
Think you that you are equal to taking Dingjun Mountain?â
To this harangue of Liu Bei, the veteran nobly answered that he was willing to
try and was ready to start when they would.
Said Zhuge Liang hastily, âDo not be hasty. You are brave enough, General,
but Xiahou Yuan is a man of different stamp from Zhang He. Xiahou Yuan is a
real strategist and tactician; so much so that Cao Cao relies upon him as his
defense against Xiliang. It was he who was set to defend Changan when
threatened by Ma Chao. Now he is in Hanzhong, and Cao Cao puts his whole
confidence in him and his skill as a leader. You have overcome Zhang He, but it
is not certain you will conquer this man. I think I must send down to Jingzhou
for Guan Yu for this task.â
Huang Zhong hotly replied, âOld Lian Po was eighty years old and yet he ate a
bushel of rice and ten pounds of flesh, so that his vigor frightened the nobles
and not one dared encroach upon the borders of the state of Zhao. I am not yet
seventy. You call me old, O Instructor; then I will not take any helper, but go
out simply with my own three thousand troops, and we will lay Xiahou Yuanâs
head at your feet.â
Zhuge Liang refused to allow him to go; Huang Zhong insisted. At last Zhuge
Liang consented, but said he would send an overseer.
They put upon his mettle the man who was to go,
Youthâs vigor may be lesser worth than ageâs powers, we know.
The next chapter will tell who the overseer was.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 71 ****
âIf you are really determined to undertake this expedition, I shall send Fa
Zheng with you,â said Zhuge Liang to the veteran leader. âYou will have to
discuss everything with him. I shall also dispatch supports and
reinforcements.â
Huang Zhong agreed, and the expedition set out.
Then Zhuge Liang explained to Liu Bei, âI purposely tried to spur on the old
general that he will really exert himself, else he fears he will not do much.
But he will need reinforcement.â
After this, Zhuge Liang ordered Zhao Zilong to march after the first army and
help, if help was needed. So long as the old man was victorious, Zhao Zilong
was to do nothing; if he was in difficulties, then Zhao Zilong was to rescue.
Also, three thousand troops under Liu Feng and Meng Da were sent out among the
hills to take position at strategic points and set up many banners and make a
brave show in order to spread the impression of huge forces, and so frighten
and perplex the enemy. In addition, Zhuge Liang sent to Xiabian Pass to tell Ma
Chao what part to play in the campaign. Yan Yan was to hold Langzhong and Baxi
in place of Zhang Fei and Wei Yan, who also went in expedition in Hanzhong.
The refugees, Zhang He and Xiahou Shang, reached Xiahou Yuanâs camp and told
their doleful tale, âTiandang Mountain has been captured, and Xiahou De and
Han Hao have died with the loss. Liu Bei is about to invade Hanzhong. Send a
swift messenger to inform the Prince of Wei and ask for help.â
The news was sent to Cao Hong, who bore it quickly to Capital Xuchang.
Cao Cao lost no time in calling a council.
Then High Minister Liu Ye said, âThe loss of Hanzhong would shake the whole
Middle Land. You, O Prince, must not shrink from toil and hardship, but must
yourself go to lead the army.â
âThis state of things comes of my not heeding your words before, gentle
Sir,â said Cao Cao, then repentant.
However, Cao Cao hastily prepared and issued an edict to raise an army of four
hundred thousand troops which he would lead.
The army was ready in the seventh month, the early autumn, in the twenty-third
year (AD 218), and marched in three divisions. The leading division was under
Xiahou Dun, Cao Cao commanded the center, and Cao Xiu was the rear guard.
Cao Cao rode a white horse, beautifully caparisoned. His guards were clad in
embroidered silk. They carried the huge red parasol woven of silk and gold
threads. Beside him in two lines were the symbols of kingly dignity, the golden
melons, silver axes, stirrups, clubs, spears, and lances; banderoles
embroidered with the sun and moon, dragon and phoenix, all were borne aloft.
His imperial escort of twenty-five thousand stout warriors led by bold
officers, marched in five columns of five thousand each, under banners of the
five colors, blue, yellow, red, white, and black. The five companies made a
brave show as they marched, each column under its own flag with soldiers in
armors and horses in caparisons all of one color and all glittering in the sun.
As they debouched through Tong Pass, Cao Cao noticed in the distance a thick
wood, very luxuriant, and asked those near him what it was called.
âThis place is the Indigo Field,â they replied. âAnd in that wood is the
estate of the late Minister Cai Yong. His daughter, Cai Yan, and her present
husband, Dong Si, live there.â
Now Cao Cao and Cai Yong had been excellent friends at one time. Cai Yongâs
daughter had been first married to Wei Zhongdao. Then she was abducted by the
frontier tribes and taken away to the north, where she had borne two sons. She
had composed a ballad called âEighteen Stanzas for the Mongol Flageolet,â
which was widespread to the empire. Cao Cao had been moved by pity for her
sorrows and sent a messenger with a thousand ounces of gold to ransom her. The
Prince of the frontier Xiongnu State, Ce Xian the Khan, overawed by Cao Caoâs
strength, had restored her to Cai Yong. Then Cao Cao gave her in marriage to
Dong Si.
Ordering his escort to march on, Cao Cao went up to the gate with only a few
attendants, dismounted, and inquired after the lady of the house. At this time
Dong Si was absent at his post, and the lady was alone. As soon as she heard
who her visitor was, she hastened to welcome him and led him into the reception
room. When Cao Cao was seated and she had performed the proper salutations, she
stood respectfully at his side. Glancing round the room, Cao Cao saw a rubbing
of a tablet hanging on the wall. So he got up to read it, and asked his hostess
about it.
âIt is a tablet of Cao E, or the fair Lady Cao. In the time of the Emperor He
(AD 100), in the Xiongnu State there was a certain magician named Cao Xu, who
could dance and sing like the very Spirit of Music. On the fifth of the fifth
month he was out in a boat, and being intoxicated, fell overboard and was
drowned. He had a daughter, Cao E, then fourteen years of age. She was greatly
distressed and sought the body of her father for seven days and nights, weeping
all the while. Then she threw herself into the waves, and five days later she
floated to the surface with her fatherâs body in her arms. The villagers
buried them on the bank, and the magistrate reported the occurrence to the
Emperor as a worthy instance of daughterly affection and remarkable piety.
âA later magistrate had the story inscribed by Handan Chun in memory of the
event. At that time Handan Chun was only thirteen, but the composition of the
inscription was so perfect that neither jot nor tittle could be added, and yet
he had written it impromptu without revision. The stone was set up beside the
grave, and both inscription and story were the admiration of all the people of
that day. My father went to see it. It was evening, but in the obscurity he
felt out the inscription with his fingers. He got hold of a pencil and wrote
eight large characters on the reverse of the stone and, later, some person
recutting the stone engraved these eight words as well.â
Cao Cao then read the eight words; they formed an enigma. Literally they read,
âyellow silk, young wife, a daughterâs child, pestle and mortar.â
âCan you explain?â asked Cao Cao of his hostess.
âNo. Although it is a writing of my fatherâs, thy handmaid cannot interpret
it,â she replied.
Turning to the strategists of his staff, Cao Cao said, âCan anyone of you
explain it?â
But no one made any reply. Suddenly, they heard one voice, âI have grasped
the meaning of it.â
The man who said he had fathomed the meaning was First Secretary Yang Xiu.
âDo not tell me yet. Let me think it out,â said Cao Cao.
Soon after they took leave of the lady, went out of the farm, and rode on.
About one mile from the farm, the meaning suddenly dawned upon Cao Cao.
He laughingly turned to Yang Xiu, saying, âNow, you may try.â
âThis is the solution of the enigma,â said Yang Xiu. ââYellow silkâ
is silk threads of natural color, and the character for âsilkâ placed
beside that for âcolorâ forms a word meaning âfinally, decidedlyâ. The
âyoung wifeâ is a âlittle femaleâ, and the character for âfemaleâ
with âlittleâ, or âfewâ, placed beside it forms a word meaning
âadmirable, fineâ. The âdaughterâs childâ is âdaughterâ and
âchildâ, which side by side make the word âgoodâ. And a âpestle and
mortarâ suggest pounding together the five bitter herbs in a receptacle: The
character for âreceptacleâ and âbitterâ form a word meaning âto
tellâ. So the four words are âDecidedly fine and well told.ââ
Cao Cao was astonished at Yang Xiuâs cleverness, and said, âJust what I
made it.â
Those around greatly wondered at Yang Xiuâs ingenuity and knowledge.
In less than a day they reached Nanzheng, where Cao Hong welcomed them. He told
the tale of Zhang Heâs misfortunes.
âTo suffer defeat is no crime,â said Cao Cao. âThat and victory are
things that happen constantly in war.â
âLiu Bei has sent Huang Zhong to take Dingjun Mountain,â said Cao Hong.
âXiahou Yuan, hearing you were coming, O Prince, has been defending the
position and not going out to give battle.â
âBut standing always on the defensive is showing weakness,â said Cao Cao.
Thereupon he bade a man carry an authority ensign to the Mountain Commander and
so order him to attack the enemy.
âXiahou Yuan is very stern and inflexible, and he may be carried too far and
fall victim to some vile ruse,â said Liu Ye.
Wherefore the Prince wrote a letter to him to accompany the authority ensign.
And when the messenger arrived and the letter was opened, it read:
âEvery leader must exercise a combination of inflexibility and yielding.
Boldness is not the only thing that counts; if he makes it so, then is he a
mere creature to fight. Now I am camped at Nanzheng ready to watch the deeds of
your admirable prowess and capacity, and all I have to say is, âDo not
disgrace your previous reputation.ââ
The letter pleased the commander mightily. Having sent away the bearer, Xiahou
Yuan called in Zhang He to consult.
âThe Prince has a great army at Nanzheng ready to destroy Liu Bei. We have
been on the defense here long enough, and it is time we rendered some solid
service. Tomorrow I am going out to battle, and hope to capture Huang Zhong.â
âYour opponent combines ready resource with boldness and prevision,â said
Zhang He. âBeside, he has Fa Zheng to aid him; and you must be cautious, for
the country is very difficult and dangerous. You had better keep on the
defensive.â
âHow shall we be able to look our prince in the face when other leaders
render good services? However, you just keep the hill, and I will go out to
battle.â
Then an order was issued asking who would go out to reconnoiter and provoke a
battle. Xiahou Shang volunteered.
Xiahou Yuan said to him, âYou are not to make a real stand, but merely to
begin the fight. You are to lose and not win, for a grand ruse is ready for the
enemy.â
He explained his plans, and Xiahou Shang went away with a small column.
Now Huang Zhong and his helper Fa Zheng were camped quite close to the Dingjun
Mountain. They had endeavored to entice Xiahou Yuan out into the field to
fight, but failed to attack him as he stood in that difficult, mountainous
country. So thus far no advance had been made. But as soon as Xiahou Shangâs
troops appeared and seemed to offer battle, Huang Zhong was ready to march out
to meet them at once. But General Chen Shi, offered his services.
âDo not trouble yourself to move, O General,â said Chen Shi, âfor I will
go out to fight them.â
Huang Zhong consented, and placed three thousand troops under Chen Shi, who
went out of the valley and set his army in array. And when Xiahou Shang came up
and, as arranged, merely fought a few bouts and ran away. Chen Shi followed to
take advantage of his success. But he was soon brought to a standstill by the
rolling of logs and hurling of stones on the part of his opponents. As he
turned to retire, Xiahou Yuan brought out his troops and attacked. Chen Shi had
no chance against them and was quickly made prisoner. Many of his soldiers
joined the enemy, but a few escaped to their own side and told Huang Zhong of
the misfortune.
Huang Zhong at once asked advice from Fa Zheng, who said, âThis Xiahou Yuan
is easily provoked to anger, and being angry he is bold without discretion.
Your way now is to work up the enthusiasm of your soldiers, then break camp and
advance. Do this in a series of marches, and you will excite him up to the
point of giving battle, when you can capture him. They call this the âRuse of
the Interchange of Host and Guestâ.â
So Huang Zhong collected all the things his soldiers liked, and made them
presents, till the sound of rejoicing filled the whole valley and the men were
hot to fight. Then camp was broken, and the army marched forward a certain
distance. Then they encamped. After some daysâ rest the march was repeated;
and then again.
When tidings of the advance reached Xiahou Yuan, he proposed to go out and
fight.
âNo, no,â said the prudent Zhang He. âThis is a well known ruse, and you
should remain on the defensive. You will lose if you fight.â
Xiahou Yuan was not the man to stomach this moderate advice, so he sent out
Xiahou Shang to give battle. As soon as this force reached the camp of Huang
Zhong, the Veteran General mounted and rode out to fight. In the very first
bout he captured Xiahou Shang. Those who escaped told how their leader had been
captured, and Xiahou Yuan at once sent to offer an exchange of prisoners. This
was agreed to, to be effected the following day in front of both armies.
So next day both sides were arrayed in a spot where the valley widened, the two
leaders on horseback beneath their respective standards. Beside each stood his
prisoner. Neither was encumbered with robe or helmet, but each wore thin,
simple dress. At the first beat of the drum each started to race over to his
own side. Just as Xiahou Shang reached the ranks of his own side, Huang Zhong
shot an arrow and wounded him in the back. The wounded man did not fall, but
went on.
But Xiahou Yuan, mad with rage, could contain himself no longer. He galloped
straight at Huang Zhong, which was exactly what the latter wanted to irritate
him into doing. The fight that then ensued went on for twenty bouts, when
suddenly the gongs clanged out from Xiahou Yuanâs side and he drew off. Huang
Zhong pressed on and shattered the army of Wei.
When Xiahou Yuan reached his own side, he asked why the gong had sounded.
âBecause we saw the banners of Shu through openings in the mountains in
several places, and we feared an ambush,â said Zhang He.
Xiahou Yuan believed him and did not return to the battlefield. He simply
remained defensive.
Before long, Huang Zhong had got quite near to Xiahou Yuanâs camp, and then
he asked further advice from his colleague.
Fa Zheng pointed over to the hills and said, âThere rises a steep hill on the
west of Dingjun Mountain, difficult of access, but from its summit one has a
complete view of the defenses of the enemy. If you can take this hill, the
mountain lies in the hollow of your hand.â
Huang Zhong looked up and saw the top of the hill was a small tableland and
there were very few defenders there. So that evening he left his camp, dashed
up the hill, drove out the small host of one hundred under Xiahou Yuanâs
General Du Xi and took it. It was just opposite to Dingjun Mountain.
Then said Fa Zheng, âNow take up position half way up the hill, while I go to
the top. When the enemy appears, I will show a white flag. But you will remain
quiet till the enemy become tired and remiss, when I will hoist a red flag.
That will be the signal for attack.â
Huang Zhong cheerfully prepared to act on this plan. In the meantime Du Xi, who
had been driven from the hill-top, had run back and reported the loss of the
hill to Xiahou Yuan.
âWith Huang Zhong in occupation of that hill, I simply must give battle,â
said Xiahou Yuan.
Zhang He strongly dissuaded him, saying, âThe whole thing is but a ruse of Fa
Zheng. General, you had better defend our position.â
But Xiahou Yuan was obstinate.
âFrom the top of that hill the whole of our position is visible, our strength
and our weakness. I must fight.â
In vain were the remonstrances repeated. Xiahou Yuan set out his troops to
surround the opposite hill and then began to vent his rage at his enemy so as
to incite Huang Zhong to give battle.
Then the white flag was hoisted. However, Xiahou Yuan was allowed to fume and
rage in vain. He tried every form of insult, but no one appeared. In the
afternoon the soldiers became weary and dispirited. Plainly their eagerness had
gone; and Fa Zheng unfurled the red flag.
Then the drums rolled out, and the men of Shu shouted till the earth seemed to
shake as the hoary old leader rode out and led his force down the slope with a
roar as of an earthquake. Xiahou Yuan was too surprised to defend himself. His
chief enemy rushed straight to his standard. With a thundering shout, Huang
Zhong raised his sword and cleft Xiahou Yuan through between the head and
shoulders so that he fell in two pieces.
Hoary headed is he, but he goes up to battle;
Gray haired, yet recklessly mighty;
With his strong arms he bends the bow,
The arrows fly.
With the swiftness of the wind he rides,
The white sword gleams.
The sound of his voice is as the roar of a tiger,
His steed is fleet as a dragon in flight.
Victory is his and its rich rewards,
For he extends the domain of his lord.
At the death of their general, the soldiers of Wei fled for their lives, and
Huang Zhong attacked Dingjun Mountain. Zhang He came out to oppose the army of
Shu, but, attacked at two points by Huang Zhong and Chen Shi, he could not
stand. He lost the day and fled. However, before he had gone far, another
cohort flashed out from the hills and barred his way.
And the leader cried out, âZhao Zilong of Changshan is here!â
Confused and uncertain what to do, Zhang He led his troops toward Dingjun
Mountain. But a body of soldiers came out to stop him.
The leader was Du Xi, who said, âThe mountain is in the hands of Liu Feng and
Meng Da!â
So Zhang He and Du Xi joined their forces and went to River Han, where they
camped. Thence they sent to tell Cao Cao of their defeat.
At the news of the death of Xiahou Yuan, Cao Cao uttered a great cry and then
he understood the prediction of the soothsayer, Guan Lu, that the cast showed
opposition: It was the twenty-fourth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (three and
eight cross); the yellow boar (the month Xiahou Yuan died) had met the tiger;
the expedition had suffered a loss indeed by the death of a general, and the
death had taken place at the mount known as âArmy Haltâ (Dingjun). The
affection between Cao Cao and his general had been very close, for he
considered Xiahou Yuan as his limb.
Cao Cao sent to inquire the whereabouts of Guan Lu, but no one knew.
Cao Cao nourished feelings of resentment against the slayer of his friend, and
he led his army out against Dingjun Mountain to avenge Xiahou Yuanâs death.
Xu Huang led the van. When the army reached River Han, Zhang He and Du Xi
joined them.
They said to Cao Cao, âDingjun Mountain is lost. Before marching farther, the
stores in Micang Mountain should be moved to the Northern Mountain.â
And Cao Cao agreed.
Huang Zhong cut off the head of Xiahou Yuan and took it to Liu Bei when he
reported his victory. For these services, Liu Bei conferred upon him the title
General Who Conquers the West, and great banquets were given in his honor.
While these were going on, General Zhang Zhu brought the news: âCao Caoâs
army of two hundred thousand troops is on the way to avenge Xiahou Yuanâs
loss; and the supplies on Micang Mountain are being moved to the Northern
Mountain.â
Then said Zhuge Liang, âCao Cao is certainly short of supplies. If we can
burn what he has and destroy his baggage train, he will have but little spirit
left to fight.â
âI am willing to undertake the task,â said Huang Zhong.
âRemember Cao Cao is a different sort of man from Xiahou Yuan.â
Liu Bei said, âZhang He is the Escort Leader of the train. Though Xiahou Yuan
was the Mountain Commander, after all he was but a bold warrior. It would have
been ten times better to have killed Zhang He.â
âI will go and kill him,â said the aged general, firing up.
âThen go with Zhao Zilong,â said Zhuge Liang. âAct in concert and see who
can do best.â
Huang Zhong agreed to this condition, and Zhang Zhu was sent with him as
Marching General.
Soon after the army had marched out, Zhao Zilong asked of his colleague,
âWhat plan have you prepared against Cao Caoâs army of two hundred thousand
in their ten camps, and how are the stores of grain and forage to be
destroyed?â
âI am going to lead,â said Huang Zhong.
âNo wait. I am going first,â said Zhao Zilong.
âBut I am the senior leader. You are only my second,â said Huang Zhong.
âNo. You and I are equal in responsibility and both anxious to render good
service. We are no rivals. Let us cast lots for who is to lead the way.â
They did so, and the Veteran General gained precedence.
âSince you have won the right to make the first attempt, you must let me help
you,â said Zhao Zilong. âNow let us decide upon a fixed time, and if you
have returned by that time, I shall not need to stir. But if at that time you
have not come back, then I shall come to reinforce you.â
âThat suits me admirably,â said Huang Zhong.
So they decided upon noon as the time.
Zhao Zilong went back to his own camp, where he called in his Deputy General,
Zhang Yi, and said, âMy friend Huang Zhong is going to try to burn the stores
tomorrow. If he has not returned at noon, I am to go to aid him. You are to
guard our camp, which is in a dangerous place by the river, but you are not to
move out unless compelled.â
Huang Zhong went back to his camp and said to his general, Zhang Zhu, âI have
slain Xiahou Yuan and cowed Zhang He. I am going to destroy the enemyâs store
of grain tomorrow, taking with me most of the troops. You are to come and
assist me. A meal for the men is to be ready about midnight tonight, and we
shall move at the fourth watch. We shall march to the foot of their hill,
capture Zhang He, and then start the fire.â
All being ready, they set out â-Huang Zhong leading â-and stole across
River Han to the foot of the hills. As the sun got up out of the east, they saw
before them mountains of grain and only a few guards on watch. These fled at
first sight of the army of Shu. The horsemen dismounted and began to collect
brushwood and pile it round the grain heaps. Just as they were starting the
fire, there appeared a cohort led by Zhang He, who at once began a fight with
Huang Zhong. Then Cao Cao heard of the fight and sent Xu Huang to help. Xu
Huang came up in the rear, and Huang Zhong was surrounded. Zhang Zhu with three
thousand troops tried to get away to their camp, but they were intercepted by
Wen Ping; and more troops of Wei coming up by the rear, Zhang Zhu also was
surrounded. Both were in difficulties.
Meanwhile, time passed and noon came with no news of Huang Zhong. Wherefore
Zhao Zilong girded on his armor, took three thousand troops with him and went
to his aid. Just as he was leaving, he again warned Zhang Yi to keep good
watch.
âGuard the camp most carefully. See that you have archers and crossbowmen on
both sides.â
âYes, yes,â said Zhang Yi.
Zhao Zilong rode off, spear in hand, and went out to give battle where he could
find the enemy. Soon he fell in with one of Wen Pingâs companies led by
General Murong Lie. Zhao Zilong plunged in, cut Murong Lie down, and disposed
of the troops of Wei. Then he came to the real press. A cohort barred his way,
led by General Jiao Bing.
âWhere are the soldiers of Shu?â cried Zhao Zilong.
âAll killed!â cried Jiao Bing.
Zhao Zilong angrily dashed forward and thrust Jiao Bing through so that he
died. The cohort scattered, and Zhao Zilong went on to the foot of Northern
Mountain, where he found Huang Zhong surrounded. With a yell Zhao Zilong dashed
at the encircling ring, thrusting this way and shoving that, so that everyone
shrank and recoiled before him. The mighty spear laid low his opponents like
the whirlwind scatters the petals of the wild pear tree till they lie on the
bosom of the earth like snowflakes. Panic seized Zhang He and Xu Huang so that
they dared not stand in his way, and thus Zhao Zilong fought his way through
and rescued his fellow warrior. Then they fought their way out and none could
withstand them.
Cao Cao had been watching the course of the fighting from a high place, and
when he saw a doughty warrior forcing his way into the press and all going down
before him, he asked of his officers if they knew who the leader was.
âThat is Zhao Zilong of Changshan,â replied one who knew.
âSo the hero of Dangyang is still alive,â said Cao Cao, marveled.
Then Cao Cao gave general orders to his soldiers not to attack Zhao Zilong
without being sure of success, no matter where they met him.
Having rescued his colleague and got clear of the battle, Zhao Zilong was told
Zhang Zhu hemmed in on a hill not far off. Wherefore Zhao Zilong went to his
relief before going back to his own camp. He had little need to fight, for Cao
Caoâs soldiers no sooner saw the name emblazoned on the banners than they
fled without more ado.
But it filled Cao Cao with rage to see his troops falling away before Zhao
Zilong, who marched on as though no one would think of standing in his way, and
Cao Cao went in pursuit himself with his officers.
Zhao Zilong reached his own camp, where he was welcomed by Zhang Yi. But a
cloud of dust was seen in the distance, and they knew Cao Cao was in that cloud
and coming upon them.
âLet us bar the gates while we make preparation,â said Zhang Yi.
âDo not bar the gates,â said Zhao Zilong. âHave you never heard of my
exploit at Dangyang, when I laughed at Cao Caoâs many legions? Now that I
have an army at my back and generals to help, what is there to fear?â
Then Zhao Zilong placed the archers and the bowmen in a covered position
outside, while he threw down all the weapons and flags within. And no drums
beat. But he himself, alone, stood outside the gate of the camp.
It was dusk when Zhang He and Xu Huang neared the camp of the army of Shu. They
saw that the ensigns and weapons had been overthrown, and no drums beat at
their approach. They also saw the one figure of the doughty warrior at the
gate, and then they halted and dared advance no farther. While they hesitated,
Cao Cao arrived and urged his army to march quicker. They answered with a shout
and made a dash forward, but they saw the one figure at the gate, and every man
halted. And before long, one by one they turned about and went away.
Then Zhao Zilong gave a signal to his troops to come out of the moat, and the
archers and bowmen began to shoot. The soldiers of Cao Cao knew not in the dusk
how many their enemies were, but terror seized upon them and they ran, each
trying to be first. And as they ran, the drums rolled, and the soldiers of Shu
shouted and pursued, till the flight became a perfect rout and a confused mass
of troops reached the banks of River Han. The press continuing, many soldiers
of Cao Cao were forced into the river and were drowned.
Zhao Zilong, Huang Zhong, and Zhang Zhu followed close on the heels of the
routed army. While Cao Cao was making off with all speed, two other generals of
Shu, Liu Feng and Meng Da, came from Micang Mountain and set fire to all the
army stores of food and forage in Northern Mountain. Then Cao Cao abandoned the
stores in Northern Mountain and set out hastily for Nanzheng. Zhang He and Xu
Huang could make no stand, and they also abandoned their camps, which Zhao
Zilong at once occupied. Beside the stores of food, the victors collected
countless weapons along the banks of the river.
They sent news of the victory to Liu Bei, who came with Zhuge Liang to the
scene of the victory, and there they heard the full story of Zhao Zilongâs
prowess. Liu Bei was very glad, and when he had seen the steepness and
difficulties of the surrounding hills, he understood the fine deeds of valor
that had been done.
Turning to Zhuge Liang, Liu Bei said, âTruly, the man is brave all
through!â
Behold Zhao Zilong of Changshan,
Whose whole body is valor;
Formerly he fought at Dangyang,
And his courage today is no less.
He rushes into the array to manifest heroism;
Surrounded by his enemies,
He is dauntless and daring.
Devils howl and spirits cry,
The sky is afraid and earth trembles.
Such is Zhao Zilong, the brave,
Whose whole body is valor.
For his services Liu Bei gave Zhao Zilong the title of General Who Possesses
Tiger Prowess. And the soldiers of his army were rewarded, and there was
banqueting to a late hour.
Soon it was reported: âCao Cao is coming again down through the Xie Valley to
try to capture River Han.â
But Liu Bei laughed, saying, âHe will not succeed, for I think that we shall
gain command of the river.â
Then Liu Bei led his army west of the river to oppose Cao Cao. When Cao Cao
drew near, he sent out Xu Huang to lead the van and open the battle.
A General named Wang Ping said, âI know the country well, and I wish to help
General Xu Huang to destroy the army of Shu.â
Wang Ping was sent as second in command.
Cao Cao camped on the north of Dingjun Mountain, and his advanced guard marched
away making for River Han. And when they reached the bank, Xu Huang gave orders
to cross to the other side.
âTo cross the river is well,â said Wang Ping, âbut what if you have to
retreat?â
âOf old, when Han Xin made his array with a river in his rear, he said that
out of the place of death one could return to life.â
âYou are mistaken now. The cases are not the same, for then Han Xin knew his
opponents were unskillful. Have you reckoned upon the skill of our opponents,
Zhao Zilong and Huang Zhong?â
âYou may lead the footmen to hold the enemy while I destroy them with the
horsemen,â said Xu Huang.
Then bridges were built and the army crossed.
A man of Wei wildly quoted Han Xin,
A minister of Shu would be another Zhang Liang?
Who won the victory will next be revealed.

**** Chapter 72 ****
Huang Zhong and Zhao Zilong asked to be allowed to go against the host of Cao
Cao, and Liu Bei gave his consent.
Then said Huang Zhong, âXu Huang has been bold enough to come. We will not go
out against him till evening, when his soldiers are fatigued. Then we will fall
upon him one on either side.â
Zhao Zilong consented, and each retired to a stockade. Xu Huang appeared and
for a long time tried to draw them into a fight, but they refused to go forth.
Then Xu Huang ordered his bowmen to begin to shoot straight before them, and
the arrows and bolts fell in the Shu camp.
Huang Zhong said, âHe must be thinking of retreat, or he would not shoot
thus. Now is our time to smite him.â
Then the scouts reported that the rearmost bodies of the enemy had begun to
retreat. The drums of Shu rolled a deafening peal, and Huang Zhongâs army
from the left and Zhao Zilongâs army from the right came to the attack, and
the double fight began. Xu Huang was badly defeated, and the flying soldiers
were forced to River Han, where many were drowned. But Xu Huang escaped after
fighting desperately, and when he got back to camp, he blamed his colleague
Wang Ping for not having come to his aid.
âHad I done so, these camps would have been left unguarded,â said Wang
Ping. âI tried to dissuade you from going, but you would not hear me, and you
brought about this reverse yourself.â
Xu Huang in his wrath tried to slay Wang Ping, but Wang Ping escaped to his own
camp. In the night, Wang Ping set fire on both camps, and great confusion
reigned in the lines. Xu Huang ran away, but Wang Ping crossed the river and
surrendered to Zhao Zilong, who led him to Liu Bei. Wang Ping told Liu Bei all
about River Han and the country near by.
âI shall surely capture Hanzhong now that you are here to help me, friend
Wang Ping,â said Liu Bei.
Liu Bei made Wang Ping General and Army Guide.
Xu Huang reported Wang Pingâs defection, which made Cao Cao very angry. Cao
Cao placed himself at the head of a force and tried to retake the bank of the
river.
Zhao Zilong, thinking his troops too few, retired to the west side, and the two
armies lay on opposite sides of the stream. Liu Bei and his adviser came down
to view the position. Zhuge Liang saw in the upper course of the stream a hill
which might well screen a thousand soldiers.
So Zhuge Liang returned to camp, called in Zhao Zilong and said, âGeneral,
you lead five hundred troops, with drums and horns, and place them in ambush
behind the hill, to await certain orders which will come some time during the
night or at dawn. When you hear a detonation, you are not to appear, only give
a long roll of the drums at every report.â
Zhao Zilong departed to play his part in the drama, while Zhuge Liang went to a
hill whence he could overlook the scene.
When next the army of Cao Cao approached the camp of Shu and offered battle,
not a man came out, nor was an arrow or a bolt shot. They retired without any
result. But in the depths of the night, when all the lights in the camp were
extinguished and all appeared tranquil and restful, Zhuge Liang exploded a
bomb, and at once Zhao Zilong beat his drums and blared his trumpets. Cao
Caoâs soldiers awoke in alarm, thinking it was a night raid. They rushed out,
but there was no enemy, and as the hubbub ceased they went back to sleep. Soon
after there was another bomb, and again the drums and the trumpets seeming to
shake the earth itself, and the fearsome roar echoing along the valleys and
from the hills again scared Cao Caoâs soldiers. Thus the night passed in
constant alarms. The next night was the same, and the next. On the fourth day
Cao Cao broke up his camp, marched his troops ten miles to the rear and pitched
his camp in a clear, wide space among the hills.
Zhuge Liang was pleased at the result of his ruse. Said he, smiling, âCao Cao
is skilled in war, but still he is not proof against all deceitful tricks.â
The troops of Shu then crossed the river and camped with the stream behind
them. When Liu Bei asked the next move, he was told, but also told to keep the
plan a secret.
Seeing Liu Bei thus encamped, Cao Cao became doubtful and anxious, and, to
bring things to a decision, he sent a written declaration of war, to which
Zhuge Liang replied that they would fight a battle on the morrow.
On the morrow the armies faced each other half way between the two camps in
front of the Mountain of Five Borders, and there they arrayed. Cao Cao
presently rode up stood beside his banner, with his officers right and left and
the dragon and phoenix banners fluttering in the wind. His drums rolled thrice,
and then he summoned Liu Bei to a parley. Liu Bei rode out supported by Liu
Feng, Meng Da, and other leaders. Then Cao Cao insolently flourizshed his whip
and vilified his opponent.
âLiu Bei, you have forgotten kindness and lost the sense of right. You are a
rebel against the government.â
Liu Bei answered, âI am related to the imperial family, and I hold an edict
authorizing me to seize all rebels. You have dared to lift up your hand against
Empress Fu, made yourself a king, and arrogantly presume to an imperial
chariot. If you are not a rebel, what are you?â
Then Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang out to give battle, and Liu Feng went to meet
him. As the combat began, Liu Bei retired within the ranks of his array. Liu
Feng was no match for his opponent, and fled.
Cao Cao issued an order to capture Liu Bei, saying, âHe who captures Liu Bei
will be made Prince of Hanzhong!â
At this the army of Wei uttered one great roar of rage, then they came surging
on. The troops of Shu fled toward the river abandoning everything, even
throwing aside their weapons, which littered the road. But as Cao Caoâs army
pressed forward, he suddenly clanged the gongs, called a halt and drew off.
âWhy did you call us off, O Prince, just as we were on the point of
success?â said his commanders.
âBecause I saw the enemy had encamped with the river in their rear, which was
very suspicious. They also abandoned their steeds and weapons, which made me
doubt. Wherefore I could only retire. But retain your armor. Let not a person
take off his harness on pain of death. Now retire as quickly as you can
march.â
As Cao Cao turned about to retire, Zhuge Liang hoisted the signal to attack,
and the retreating soldiers were harassed on every side both night and day till
they were all disordered. Cao Cao ordered his army to retire to Nanzheng.
Presently they saw flames rising all around, and soon it was known that their
city of refuge was in the hands Zhang Fei and Wei Yan, who, after Yan Yan had
taken the command of Langzhong, had launched a double attack and captured
Nanzheng. Disappointed and saddened, Cao Cao bade them march to Yangping Pass.
Liu Bei with the main army followed them to Baozhou and Nanzheng and there
pacified the people and restored confidence.
âCao Cao was exceedingly quickly overcome this time,â said Liu Bei. âHow
was that?â
âHe has always been of a suspicious nature,â said Zhuge Liang, âand that
has led to many failures although he is a good leader of armies. I have
defeated him by playing upon his doubts.â
âHe is rather weakened now,â said Liu Bei. âCan you not devise a plan to
drive him away finally?â
âThat is all thought out.â
Next Zhang Fei and Wei Yan were sent along two different roads to cut off Cao
Caoâs supplies. Two other cohorts led by Huang Zhong and Zhao Zilong were
bidden to go and fire the hills and forests. All these four armies had natives
of the place to act as guides and show the way.
Cao Caoâs scouts sent out from Yangping Pass returned to report: âThe roads
far and near are blocked by the troops of Shu, and every place seems to be
burning. No soldier is seen.â
Cao Cao knew not what to do. Then other scouts told him, âOur stores are
being plundered by Zhang Fei and Wei Yan.â
At this, Cao Cao called for a volunteer to drive off the plunderers; and Xu Chu
offered. He was given a thousand veterans, and went down the Pass to act as
escort of the grain wagons.
The officers in charge of the transport were very glad to receive a general of
such renown.
âExcept for you, O General, the grain could never reach Yangping Pass.â
They entertained Xu Chu with the wine and food on the carts; and he ate and
drank copiously, so that he became very intoxicated. And in that state he
insisted on marching, urging the convoy to start at once.
âThe sun has nearly set,â said the transport officers, âand the road near
Baozhou is bad and dangerous, so that we cannot pass there at night.â
âI can face any danger,â boasted the drunken general. âI am brave as a
myriad men put together. What do you think I fear? Beside, there is a good moon
tonight, just the sort of thing to take grain carts along by.â
Xu Chu took the lead, sword in hand. By the second watch they were passing
Baozhou. About half the train had passed when the rolling drums and the blare
of horns came down to them through a rift in the hills. It was soon followed by
the appearance of a cohort led by Zhang Fei. With spear ready, he came racing
down straight for Xu Chu, who, whirling his sword, dashed to the front to meet
the enemy.
But Xu Chu was too drunk to stand against such a warrior. After a few bouts he
received a spear thrust in the shoulder, turned round in his saddle, and fell
from his horse. His men rushed to his help, and they carried him away as they
retreated, while Zhang Fei took the whole transport train of fodder and forage
away to his own camp.
The defeated escort carried their wounded leader back to Cao Caoâs camp,
where he was placed in the care of physicians. Then Cao Cao himself led out his
army to fight a decisive battle with the army of Shu. Liu Bei went out to meet
him, and, when both sides were arrayed, Liu Feng went out to challenge. Cao Cao
at once let loose a torrent of taunts and reproaches.
âSeller of shoes, you are always sending out this pretended son of yours to
fight for you! If I only call my golden-bearded son Cao Zhang, your so-called
son will be chopped to mincemeat!â
These words enraged Liu Feng, who raised his spear and galloped toward Cao Cao.
Cao Cao bade Xu Huang do battle with the young man, and Liu Feng at once ran
away. Cao Cao led on his legions, but he was harassed by the explosion of
bombs, the beating of drums, and the blare of trumpets that came from every
side. He concluded that he was being led into an ambush, and he hastened to
retire. The retreat was unfortunate, for the soldiers trampled upon each other
and many were killed. Anon they all ran off to Yangping Pass as quickly as they
could.
But the soldiers of Shu came right up to the walls of the Pass, and some burned
the east gate while others shouted at the west. Others, again, burned the north
gate while drums rolled at the south. Leaders and led were alike harassed and
frightened, and presently they left the Pass and ran away. They were pursued
and sore smitten.
The road to safety was not easy. In one direction Zhang Fei barred the way,
while Zhao Zilong attacked the rear. Then Huang Zhong came from Baozhou and
pressed a slaughter on the flank. Cao Caoâs army lost many troops, and he was
severely defeated in this triple attack. His commanders gathered about him and
took him off toward the Xie Valley. Here a great cloud of dust was seen in the
distance.
âIf that is an ambush, it is the last of me,â sighed Cao Cao.
The soldiers came nearer, and then Cao Cao recognized not a enemy but his
second son, Cao Zhang. As a lad Cao Zhang was a good horseman and an expert
archer. He was more powerful than most men and could overcome a wild beast with
his bare hands. Cao Cao did not approve of the young manâs bent, and often
warned him to study instead.
âYou do not study, but only love your bow and your horse; this is the courage
of a mere person. Think you that this makes for an honorable career?â
But Cao Zhang replied, âThe really noble person ought to imitate such grand
men as Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. They won their reputation in the Gobi Desert,
where they led a mighty host of hundred thousand, able to overrun the whole
world and go anywhere. What have I to do with scholarship?â
Cao Cao used to ask his sons what career they found admirable, and Cao Zhang
always replied that he would be a leader of armies.
âBut what should a leader be like?â asked Cao Cao.
âHe should be endued with firmness and courage, never turn aside from a
difficulty, but be in the van of his officers and troops. Rewards should be
certain; and so should punishments.â
Cao Cao smiled with pleasure.
In the twenty-third year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 218), the Wuhuan Peoples
revolted in Daichun, and Cao Cao sent this son with fifty thousand troops to
suppress them. Just as Cao Zhang was leaving, his father read him a homily on
his duty.
âAt home we are father and son, but when a task is given you, you have to
consider your duty as a servant of your ruler. The law knows no kindness, and
you must beware.â
When the expedition reached the north of Daichun, Cao Zhang led the array and
smote as far as Sanggan in the Gobi Desert, and peace was restored. He had
lately heard that his father was at Yangping Pass, and had come to help him to
fight.
His coming greatly pleased his father, who said, âNow that my golden-bearded
son has arrived, we can destroy Liu Bei for certain.â
Then the army was marched back again and pitched camp at the Xie Valley.
Someone told Liu Bei of the arrival of Cao Zhang, and he asked for a volunteer
to go out against the newcomer. Liu Feng offered. Meng Da also desired to go,
and Liu Bei decided to let both go.
âVie with each other,â said he.
Each general had five thousand troops, and Liu Feng led the way. Cao Zhang rode
out and engaged him, and in the third bout Liu Feng was overcome and ran off.
Then Meng Da advanced, and a battle was just beginning when he saw that Cao
Caoâs troops were in confusion. The cause was the sudden coming of Ma Chao
and Wu Lan. Before the enemy had recovered from the panic, Meng Da attacked on
another side. Ma Chaoâs force, who had been nursing their courage for a long
time, fought brilliantly, so that none could withstand their onslaught, and
they won the day. But in his flight, Cao Zhang met Wu Lan, and he thrust and
slew Wu Lan with his spear.
After a great fight, Cao Cao ordered his army to retire into camp at the Xie
Valley. Here he remained many days, prevented from advancing by Ma Chao and
fearing the ridicule of Shu if he should retreat. One day, while he was
anxiously trying to decide what to do, his cook sent in some chicken broth. He
noticed in the broth some chicken tendons, and this simple fact led him into a
train of reflection. He was still deep in thought when Xiahou Dun entered his
tent to ask the watchword for that night.
Cao Cao at once involuntarily replied, âChicken tendon.â
The word was passed on in orders. When First Secretary Yang Xiu saw the order
that the watchword was âchicken tendon,â he told all his people to pack up
their belongings ready for the march. One who saw this went and told Xiahou
Dun, who sent for Yang Xiu and asked why he had packed up.
Yang Xiu replied, âBy tonightâs orders I see that the Prince of Wei is soon
going to retire. âChicken tendonsâ are tasteless things to eat, and yet it
is a pity to waste them. Now if we advance, we cannot conquer; and if we
retire, we fear we shall look ridiculous. There being no advantage here, the
best course is to retire. You will certainly see the Prince of Wei retreat
before long. I have made my preparations so as not to be hurried and confused
at the last moment.â
âYou seem to know the Princeâs inmost heart,â said Xiahou Dun, and he
bade his servants pack. The other generals seeing this, also made preparations
for departure.
Cao Caoâs mind was too perturbed for sleep. In the night he got up, took a
steel battle-ax in his hand, and wandered privily through the camp. When he got
to Xiahou Dunâs tents, he saw everything packed and ready for a move. Much
surprised, he made his way back to his own tent and sent for that officer.
âWhy is everything in your camp packed as if ready for the march?â
âFirst Secretary Yang Xiu seems to have private knowledge of the Princeâs
design to retire,â said Xiahou Dun.
Cao Cao summoned Yang Xiu and questioned him, and Yang Xiu replied with the
chicken tendon incident.
âHow dare you invent such a story and disturb the hearts of my army?â
Cao Cao called in his lictors and told them to take Yang Xiu away and behead
him and hang his head at the camp gate.
Yang Xiu was a man of acute and ingenious mind, but inclined to show off. His
lack of restraint over his tongue had often wounded Cao Caoâs
susceptibilities. Once Cao Cao was having a pleasance laid out, and when it was
completed, he went to inspect the work. He uttered no word of praise or blame;
he just wrote the word âAliveâ on the gate and left. Nobody could guess
what he meant till Yang Xiu heard of it.
ââGateâ with âAliveâ inside it makes the word for âwideâ,â said
he. âThe Prime Minister thinks the gates are too wide.â
Thereupon they rebuilt the outer walls on an altered plan. When complete, Cao
Cao was asked to go and see it. And he was then delighted.
âBut who guessed what I meant?â said he.
âYang Xiu,â replied his people.
Cao Cao thereafter lauded Yang Xiuâs ingenuity, but in his heart he feared.
Another time Cao Cao received a box of cream cheese from Mongolia. Cao Cao just
scribbled three words âOne Cream Boxâ on the top and left it on the table.
The words seemed to have no meaning. But Yang Xiu happened to come in, saw the
box, and at once handed a spoonful of the contents to each guest in the room.
When Cao Cao asked why he did this, he explained that that was the
interpretation of the words on the box, which, resolved into primary symbols,
read, âEach person a mouthful.â
âCould I possibly disobey your orders?â said he.
Cao Cao laughed with the others, but hatred was in his heart.
Cao Cao lived in constant fear of assassination, and said to his attendants,
âLet none of you come near me when I am sleeping, for I am likely to slay
people in my dreams.â
One day he was enjoying a siesta, and his quilt fell off. One of the attendants
saw it and hastened to cover him again. Cao Cao suddenly leaped from the couch,
cut down the intruder with his sword, and lay down again to sleep. Some time
after he awoke, simulated surprise and asked who had killed his attendant. When
they told him, Cao Cao wept aloud for the dead man and had him buried in a fine
grave. Most people thought that Cao Cao had slain the man while asleep, but
Yang Xiu knew better.
At the funeral of the victim Yang Xiu remarked, âThe Prime Minister was in no
dream, but only you were asleep.â
This only increased the hatred.
Cao Caoâs third son, Cao Zhi, took great delight in Yang Xiuâs cleverness
and often invited him, when they would talk the whole night.
When Cao Cao was considering the nomination of his heir and desired to name Cao
Zhi, Cao Pi got to hear of the proposal to set him aside in favor of his
younger brother, so he secretly requested the Master of the Court Singers, Wu
Zhi, to come and discuss this matter. Then fearing that someone might see his
visitor, Cao Pi got a large basket made, in which his friend was smuggled into
the Palace. Cao Pi gave out that the basket contained rolls of silk. Yang Xiu
heard the truth and informed Cao Cao, who sent guards to watch at the gates.
Cao Pi, in alarm, told Wu Zhi, who said, âBe not afraid, but to fill a basket
actually with rolls of silk on the morrow and have it carried in as before.â
The searchers peeped into the basket and found the rolls of silk. They told Cao
Cao the result of their search, and Cao Cao began to think Yang Xiu was
plotting against his son. This also added to his hatred.
Another time Cao Cao, wishing to compare the abilities of his two sons Cao Pi
and Cao Zhi, told them both to go out of the city, at the same time ordering
the gate wardens to forbid their exit. Cao Pi first came to the gate, was
stopped by the wardens, and returned to his palace.
But his brother Cao Zhi consulted Yang Xiu, who said, âYou have received
orders from the Prince to go out. Simply cut down any who may try to prevent
you.â
When Cao Zhi went to the gate and was stopped, he shouted out to the wardens,
âI have the Princeâs order to go out. Dare you stop me?â
He slew the man who would have prevented him. Wherefore Cao Cao considered his
younger son the more able. But when some other person told him that the device
came from Yang Xiu, he was angry and took a dislike to his son Cao Zhi.
Yang Xiu also used to coach Cao Zhi in preparing replies to likely questions,
which were learned by heart and quoted when necessary. Cao Cao was always
asking this son his opinion on military matters, and Cao Zhi always had a
fluent reply ready. His father was not without suspicions, which were turned
into certainties when Cao Pi gave his father the written replies which Cao Pi
had bribed a servant to filch from his brotherâs apartments. Cao Cao was
quite angry.
âHow dare he throw dust in my eyes like this?â said Cao Cao.
Yang Xiu very nearly lost his life for his share in that business. Now sending
him to execution on the charge of destroying the morale of the soldiers was
only a subterfuge. Yang Xiu was but thirty-four when he met his end.
Talented was Yang Xiu,
Born of an illustrious stock,
His pen traced wonderful characters,
In his breast were beautiful words.
When he talked, his hearers were astonished,
His alert responses overpast everyone.
He died because of misdirected genius
And not because he foretold retreat.
Cao Cao thus put to death the prime mover and simulated anger against Xiahou
Dun. He threatened to execute Xiahou Dun, but listened to those who begged him
to show mercy.
âGet out of this!â said he.
Next he issued an order to advance on the morrow. The army moved out of the
valley and came face to face with the troops of Shu led by Wei Yan. He summoned
Wei Yan to surrender, but received abuse and contumely in return.
Pang De went out to fight Wei Yan. But while the combat was in progress, fires
broke out in Cao Caoâs camp, and a soldier came flying to say that the rear
and center camps had been seized by Ma Chao.
Fearing lest this should lead to a rout, he drew his sword and stood before the
army, crying out, âDeath for any officer who flinches!â
Wherefore the men of Wei pressed forward valiantly, and Wei Yan, pretending
defeat, retreated. Having driven back this army, Cao Cao gave the signal to
turn toward camp and fight with Ma Chao. He took up his station on the top of a
hill whence he could survey the field.
Suddenly a cohort appeared just below him, and the leader cried, âWei Yan is
here!â
Wei Yan fitted an arrow to his bow, shot, and wounded Cao Cao right in his lip.
Cao Cao turned and fell. Wei Yan threw aside his bow, seized his sword, and
came charging up the hill to finish his enemy. But with a shouting Pang De
flashed in.
âSpare my lord!â cried Pang De.
He rushed up and drove Wei Yan backward. Then they took Cao Cao away. Ma Chao
also retired, and the wounded prince slowly returned to his own camp.
Cao Cao was wounded full in the face, and the arrow knocked out two of his
front teeth. When in the hands of the physicians, he lay thinking over Yang
Xiuâs words. In a repentant mood he had Yang Xiuâs remains decently
interred.
Then he gave the order to retreat. Pang De was the rear guard. Cao Cao set out
homeward in a padded carriage, escorted by his Tiger Guards.
Before they had gone far, there was an alarm of fire and ambush in the Xie
Valley. The soldiers of Wei were all fear-stricken.
That was something like the danger once at Tong Pass met,
Or like the fight at the Red Cliffs which no one could never forget.
How Cao Cao fared will next be told.

**** Chapter 73 ****
abandonment of his attempt to acquire possession of Hanzhong. So Zhuge Liang
sent out Ma Chao and a dozen parties to harass and hasten Cao Caoâs retreat.
For this reason the retreating army had to keep on the move. Beside, Cao Cao
was suffering from his wound, and he marched as hurriedly as possible. But it
was a dejected army, when the leading legions encountered fire on both flanks,
which had been raised by troops placed in ambush while Ma Chaoâs main force
kept driving the army before it. Everyone in the Cao Cao army was dispirited,
and there was no more courage in them. They pressed forward day and night alike
without halting to rest. It was only after reaching Jingzhao that they had some
repose.
Having conquered Hanzhong, Liu Bei sent Liu Feng, Meng Da, and Wang Ping to
take Shangyong. The Commander of the city, Shen Dan, and his colleagues,
knowing that Cao Cao had retreated, offered their submission. After confidence
had been restored among the people, Liu Bei rewarded his army generously, and
they were all joyful.
It was after this that the general body of the officers decided to urge Liu Bei
to assume the title of âEmperorâ, but they dared not tell him so. However,
they sent up a petition to Zhuge Liang.
He replied, ï¿½I have already decided on this course.ï¿½
So Zhuge Liang and Fa Zheng headed a deputation that went in to see their lord.
They said, âNow that Cao Cao really holds the reins of authority, the people
are without a true sovereign. Our lord, your kindness and sense of justice have
spread throughout the empire. You have restored peace over the two River Lands,
and your becoming an emperor would be according to Godâs will and the desire
of the people. Then by right and title you could destroy rebels. This matter
should not be delayed, and we pray you choose the auspicious day.â
But Liu Bei evinced great surprise, and replied, âYour words, O Instructor,
are wrong. Although I am of the imperial house, yet I am but a minister. And to
do this thing would be rebellion against Han.â
Zhuge Liang replied, âNot so. Today the empire is riven, and many of the
bolder spirits have seized upon and claim the rule of various portions. The
talented of the empire and the virtuous among officers, who have risked death
and lost their lives in serving those above them, all desire to have the
opportunity of serving a true emperor and doing service for a true Throne. Now,
if you insist on modestly maintaining your righteous way, I fear that you will
lose popular support. My lord, I wish that you should reflect upon this.â
âBut you desire me to usurp a place of great honor in the state, and I dare
not. Let there be more delay and discussion.â
But with one voice they said, âOur lord, if you reject this, the hearts of
the people will turn from you!â
âMy lord,â said Zhuge Liang, âyou have made rectitude your motto all your
life. If you really object to the most honored title, then, since you have
Jingzhou, Yizhou, and Hanzhong, take temporarily the title of âPrince of
Hanzhongâ.â
âGentlemen, though you may desire to honor me by the title of Prince, yet,
without an edict from the Emperor, such action would be usurpation.â
Said Zhuge Liang, âThe time demands recognition of the actual state of
authority, and not a rigid adherence to all the rules of propriety.â
And Zhang Fei roared out, âAll sorts of people with all sorts of names are
making themselves rulers: How much more ought you, brother, who are of the
dynastic stock? It ought not to be Prince of Hanzhong but Emperor. What
prevents it?â
âBrother, say no more,â said Liu Bei, roughly.
âMy lord,â said Zhuge Liang, âit is fitting to follow political changes
and suit oneâs conduct to circumstances. Wherefore first take the princedom,
and then memorialize the Throne.â
Liu Bei declined two or three times; but as there seemed no other option, he
listened and complied. In the twenty-fourth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD
219), in the seventh month, an altar was set up at Mianyang, half a square
mile, which was set around with the proper flags and banners and symbols. In
the presence of all his civil and military officers assembled according to
their rank, and at the request of the two Ministers Xu Jing and Fa Zheng, Liu
Bei received the headdress and seat of a prince. Then he took his seat, facing
the south as a ruler should, and received the salutes and felicitations of all
his officers as the Prince of Hanzhong. And his son Liu Shan was nominated his
heir-apparent.
Xu Jing was given the title of Imperial Guardian; Fa Zheng that of Chair of the
Secretariat. Zhuge Liang was reappointed Directing Instructor of the Forces,
with the additional powers of control over the whole state policy. Guan Yu,
Zhang Fei, Zhao Zilong, Huang Zhong, and Ma Chao were the Five Tiger Generals.
Wei Yan was made Governor of Hanzhong, and all the others who had assisted were
given ranks and offices.
As soon as the investiture was completed, Liu Bei composed a memorial and sent
it to Capital Xuchang. This is the document:
âI, Liu Bei, have but ordinary talents, yet was I made a general of high rank
and led a great army. Though I received a commission to purge the empire of
rebels, I was unable to cleanse it and so renew the tranquillity to Your
Majestyâs house and restore the dynasty. Too long have I delayed to spread
Your Majestyâs sacred governance. The world is evil and not in good case, and
as I sorrowfully think it over and over, I am distressed as one in severe pain.
âRebellion began with Dong Zhuo, and all kinds of evils have spread abroad;
cruelty and ferocity have become rife. Strong in faith in Your Majestyâs
sacred virtue and inspiring presence, many banded together to help. The loyal
exerted themselves to destroy the rebels, but others of them were smitten of
heaven. The fierce and the contumacious have been exterminated, and gradually
rebellion has melted away.
âOnly Cao Cao now remains, too long unpunished. He has arrogated to himself
the authority of the state. His wicked heart is very rebellious. Once I, with
General Dong Cheng, the State Uncle, conspired against him, but the plot was
discovered and my fellow conspirator suffered. Thenceforward I was a wanderer
and my loyalty availed nothing. It only allowed Cao Cao further license and
liberty to do evil, till he dared even to accomplish the death of the Empress
and the destruction of her sons. Although we might band together and form
associations, yet, with all our energy, we had to recognize that we were too
weak for war. Wherefore the years passed and nothing was accomplished. In
constant fear of destruction, we even fear more lest our duty to the state be
forgotten. Waking and sleeping we sighed, and our nights were times of anxiety.
âNow my fellows consider that history has repeated itself. They attach the
utmost importance to the family and would manifest it with all their might.
Hereditary succession of rulers is still a principle. The rulers of Zhou,
taking the two preceding dynasties as models, strengthened its clanâs
position through all the states, and it reinforced itself with the support of
the states of Jing and Zheng. When the great Founder of Han came into his own,
he ennobled his whole family with kingships and lordships. Later, the dynasty
had to issue a general command throughout the whole of the nine regions in
order to destroy the widespread Lu Family and to enhance the Liu Family.
âNow Cao Cao is an enemy of all rectitude, and his followers are all evil.
His treachery is manifest. Since the members of the imperial clan are few and
weak, the clan is not honored. Having reflected upon the ancient models and
being desirous of temporary alleviation, my fellows have made me assume the
title of Prince of Hanzhong with the addition of Regent Marshal.
âI have deeply considered these things. If one receives kindness from the
Throne and accepts the responsibility for a portion of the state and fail, then
such a fault would only be made the more serious by holding high rank and
thereby increasing the burden of reproach. But my fellows have urged me, and
they have convinced me that it would be right; and, should I refuse, the wicked
will not be destroyed and the danger to the state will not be removed. The
temple of our ancestors is in danger, and the imperial prerogatives are
failing. A faithful servant, who in the day of tribulation can undertake a
suitable policy whereby to preserve the dynasty, should not refuse his help at
any cost. Wherefore I have yielded and accepted the position for the glory of
the state.
âHumbly I think of such a title and its exalted position and the favor
vouchsafed me, and I would endeavor to show true gratitude. My anxiety is deep,
for the responsibility is heavy. I am as one on the brink of a great gulf. I
must surely exert myself to the utmost and encourage my armies and lead all
disciples of rectitude, in accordance with the will of Heaven and as occasion
serves, to smite rebellion so as to restore the dynasty.â
When this memorial reached Capital Xuchang, Cao Cao was in the Palace at Yejun,
and it annoyed him greatly.
âHow dare this mean weaver of straw shoes behave thus?â said he. âNow I
swear that I will destroy him.â
So he issued orders for the whole force of the state to go out against the two
River Lands to wage fierce war with the new Prince of Hanzhong.
But a remonstrance came from the mouth of one man.
âLet not the great Prince of Wei trouble himself to go on a distant
expedition because of a temporary annoyance. I can propose a plan of which the
execution will need not the bending of a single bow, and yet it will make Liu
Bei bring down disaster upon his own head. When his army shall have become
exhausted, it will only be necessary to send one single general against him and
victory will be ours.â
Cao Cao looked at the officer. It was First Secretary Sima Yi.
âWhat is your exalted view, my friend?â said Cao Cao.
âSun Quanâs sister is wife to Liu Bei, but Sun Quan has found an occasion
to steal away the bride. Liu Bei is in possession of Jingzhou still, and he and
Sun Quan are bitter enemies. Therefore send some able speaker with a letter to
Wu to persuade the Marquis to send an army to recover Jingzhou. That will draw
thither all the armies of Shu, when you can send your army to Hanzhong. Liu Bei
will be helpless, and his strength will be wasted.â
The scheme pleased Cao Cao. He at once drew up a letter and sent it by the hand
of Man Chong, who soon arrived in Wu. As soon as Sun Quan knew of the mission,
he summoned his advisers to consult.
Zhang Zhao said, âWei and Wu are primarily enemies because of the dissension
fomented by the words of Zhuge Liang. We have been fighting for several years,
and many lives have been lost. Now this messenger has surely come to discuss
terms of friendship, and he should be welcomed.â
On the strength of this, Man Chong was well received and conducted into the
city and into the presence of Sun Quan. He presented his letters at the
conclusion of the ceremonies of reception and declared his mission.
âWu and Wei have no fundamental quarrel, and their dissension has been
brought about by Liu Bei. My master sends me to covenant with you for an attack
on Jingzhou, while he goes against Hanzhong. This double attack being
successful, the conquered regions can be divided between us two, and we can
both swear to respect each otherâs territory.â
Having read the letter, Sun Quan prepared a banquet in honor of Man Chong and
then sent him to the guest-house to rest while he discussed the matter with his
council of advisers.
Said Gu Yong, âAlthough the messengerâs speech was all special pleading, it
was correct in form. I propose that the messenger be allowed to return and that
a covenant be made with Cao Cao for joint attack. In addition, let spies be
sent over the Great River to find out Guan Yuâs movements, and then we may
act.â
Zhuge Jin said, âI hear that since Guan Yu has been in Jingzhou, Liu Bei has
found him a wife, who has borne him a son and a daughter. The daughter is too
young to have been betrothed, wherefore let me go to ask her in marriage with
your heir. If Guan Yu agrees, then we can arrange with him to attack Cao Cao.
If Guan Yu refuses, then let us aid Cao Cao in an attack on Jingzhou.â
Sun Quan took this advice. So he sent Man Chong away and sent Zhuge Jin to
Jingzhou to try to arrange the betrothal. Zhuge Jin was received.
When the time came to state the reason for his coming, Guan Yu asked him,
âWhat have you come for, Zhuge Jin?â
âI have come seeking to ally the two houses. My master, the Marquis of Wu,
has a son who is quite clever. Hearing that you have a daughter, General, I ask
her in marriage, hereby the two houses may join in an attack on Cao Cao. This
would be an admirable result, and I pray you consider the proposal.â
But the warrior flared up.
âHow can a tigerâs daughter marry with a dogâs whelp? Were it not for
your brother, I would take your head. Say no more!â
Guan Yu called his servants to hustle forth the hapless messenger, who ran away
with his hands over his head, too astonished to look anyone in the face. And
reaching his own place, he dared not hide the manner of his reception, but told
the whole truth.
âWhat ruffianism!â exclaimed the Marquis.
Thereupon Sun Quan ordered the council again to consider an attack on Jingzhou.
Bu Zhi rose and said, âIt has been long manifest that Cao Cao wishes to usurp
the Throne, but he is afraid of Liu Bei. Now we are to attack Shu with an army,
and so Cao Cao wants to shift the misfortune to us indeed.â
âBut I also want the place,â said Sun Quan.
Said Bu Zhi, âCao Ren is already camped at Fancheng and Xiangyang and in no
danger from the river. If Cao Cao can take Jingzhou by land, why does he not
take it? However, he wants you, my lord, to send your army, and you can judge
his real intention from this. Send to Cao Cao and tell him to make Cao Ren
attack by land. Then Guan Yu must take the army from Jingzhou to Fancheng. When
Guan Yu has left Jingzhou, you can send an army to seize it.â
Sun Quan thought the scheme good and sent letters with these proposals to Cao
Cao. Cao Cao adopted the plan, and having sent the messenger back to the South
Land, he next sent Man Chong to help Cao Ren at Fancheng as Adviser in the
matter of attack. He also sent dispatches to the South Land to ask for the
assistance of Sun Quanâs marine force.
Having laid on Wei Yan the task of holding the East River Land, the Prince of
Hanzhong, with his officers, returned to Chengdu and began to set his new house
in order. A Palace was begun and public guest-houses were built, and between
Chengdu and Baishui, at selected places, they built four hundred rest-houses
and post stations. The Prince of Hanzhong also set himself to accumulate great
stores of grain and forage and to till his arsenals with weapons with the
design of mastering the capital in the north and the whole empire.
Then his spies told him of the treaty between Cao Cao and Sun Quan, with
designs upon Jingzhou, and he hastily called in Zhuge Liang to ask what should
be done.
âI felt that Cao Cao would try to do this,â said Zhuge Liang, âand most
of the advisers in the South Land will persuade Cao Cao to order Cao Ren to
begin the campaign.â
âBut what am I to do?â asked the Prince.
âFirst send a special messenger to Guan Yu with his new title, telling him to
capture Fancheng, which will so damp the ardor of the enemy that they will
break off themselves.â
Therefore Liu Bei sent Fei Shi, a minister from his Board of War, to take the
patent of the new title to Guan Yu, who received the delegate with great
deference and conducted him into the city. After they had arrived at the
official residence, Guan Yu inquired what new title had been conferred upon
him.
âThe first of the Five Tiger Generals,â replied Fei Shi.
âAnd who are the five?â
âTheir names are Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Zilong, Ma Chao, and Huang
Zhong.â
âThe second is my brother,â said Guan Yu, âMa Chao comes of a famous
family, and Zhao Zilong has been with my elder brother so long that he is as a
brother. It is right for them to be put on a level with me. But what sort of a
man is this Huang Zhong that he is ranked with us? The really great man does
not stand shoulder to shoulder with any soldier that comes along.â
And Guan Yu refused both title and seal.
âYou do wrong to refuse,â said Fei Shi. âOf old, Xiao He and Cao Shen
helped Liu Bang, the Founder of the Han Dynasty, in his great enterprise and
were very dear friends, while Han Xin was but a runaway leader from Chu. Yet
Liu Bang made Han Xin a prince, and so placed over the heads of the other two.
I have never heard that these two resented it. The Prince of Hanzhong has his
Five Tiger Generals, but he is still your brother and all that that means. As
his brother, you are he and he is you. Is there any comparison with any other?
The Prince has always treated you with the greatest kindness. You two are one
in sorrow and joy, sharers of disaster and good fortune. No such question as
that of a mere title ought to reckon at all. I pray you, Sir, reflect.â
Guan Yu understood, and thanked Fei Shi, saying, âYou have prevented me from
making a great mistake due to my ignorance.â
Guan Yu then received the seal with all humility.
Next Fei Shi produced the edict ordering the capture of Fancheng. Guan Yu lost
no time in obeying its command. He appointed Fu Shiren and Mi Fang Leaders of
the Van to take the first army out of the city into camp.
This done, a banquet was prepared for Fei Shi, and they sat late at their wine.
While still at table there was an alarm of fire in the new camp, and Guan Yu
hastened out of the city to see. He found that the two generals had also been
feasting, and the fire had started behind their tent, a spark having fallen
into some explosives, whence it spread and destroyed the whole camp and all
that was in it. Guan Yu and his soldiers did what they could to put out the
fire and then reentered the city. There Guan Yu summoned the two generals
before him, abused them for their lack of care, and sentenced them to death.
However, Fei Shi interceded for them, saying, âIt is not well to put two
leaders to death at the beginning of a campaign, before even the army has
marched. You might reprieve them at least.â
Guan Yuâs anger had by no means subsided, but he recalled the two generals
and said, âWere it not that I have the greatest regard for Chairman Fei Shi
here, I had let the sentence take its course. Now I will only flog you.â
So the two officers received forty blows each and were degraded from leading
the van. Their seals were taken away, and Mi Fang was sent to Nanjun, Fu Shiren
to Gongan.
âNow be warned,â said Guan Yu. âIf, when I return from my victories,
there is the least sign of disorder on your part, you will suffer for both
faults.â
The two men flushed crimson and went out.
Then two new officers were appointed, Liao Hua and Guan Ping. Next Guan Yu took
command of the main army, and he had two advisers â-Ma Liang and Yi Ji. Then
it was that Hu Huaâs son, Hu Ban, came to Jingzhou and joined Guan Yu, who
loved him for the sake of his father and the good service Hu Ban had rendered
when he saved Guan Yu. Guan Yu sent Hu Ban to the Prince of Hanzhong in the
train of Fei Shi.
The day that Guan Yu sacrificed to his standard before starting, he was lying
in his tent resting when suddenly there dashed into his tent a huge boar, very
large, as big as a bullock and quite black. It bit his foot. He jumped up to
kill the creature, when it squealed with the sound of tearing cloth â-and he
awoke. It was a dream, but he had a pain in his foot. The dream perplexed him,
and he could not explain it.
He related it to his son, who interpreted it happily, saying, âThe boar is a
royal beast, like the dragon, and coming to your feet means a rise of your
dignity.â
When the dream got noised abroad, for he told his officers, some interpreted it
as auspicious and some the reverse.
âWhen a person nears sixty, he ought not to be greatly disturbed by the
thought of death,â said Guan Yu. âAfter all, I am a warrior.â
Just about that time came an edict from the Prince of Hanzhong making him
Commanding General, with honorable insignia of rank and control over the nine
territories of forty-one counties in Jingzhou. When the officers congratulated
him on his new honors, they did not forget the dream.
âThis shows what a dream of boars means.â
This new distinction pleased Guan Yu greatly, and he had no more perplexing
doubts. Soon he marched away along the great road to the point of danger.
Cao Ren was in Xiangyang when he heard that Guan Yu was coming against him. He
was much put about, and inclined to trust solely to defense. But his next
command, Zhai Yuan, did not support this course and argued against it.
âThe Prince of Wei has ordered you to act in concert with Wu and take
Jingzhou. For the other side to come against such a combination is to walk in
the way of death. Certainly we have no occasion to avoid a conflict.â
On the other hand the newly sent Adviser Man Chong inculcated caution.
Said he, âGuan Yu is brave and cunning and one not to be met lightly. I think
defense is best.â
Then General Xiahou Cun said contemptuously, âThis is all the talk of a lot
of book-folks. When the flood approaches, bank up to keep it out. Let the enemy
come with their tired soldiers, and we shall go out, defeat them, and receive
our reward, for we are sure of victory.â
Cao Ren was won over to the side of those of action. He placed Man Chong in
command of the defenses of Fancheng, while he went outside to beat off Guan Yu.
When the two forces met, Guan Yu called to his side Guan Ping and Liao Hua, to
whom he gave certain orders. These two advanced, settled their array, and Liao
Hua then rode out and offered a challenge. Zhai Yuan accepted it. But soon
after the combat began, Liao Hua made as if he was defeated and turned to leave
the field. Zhai Yuan went after him. The Jingzhou troops retired seven miles or
so.
Soon the Jingzhou soldiers came again and offered battle, when Xiahou Cun and
Zhai Yuan both went out. The maneuver of the preceding day was repeated, and
the Jingzhou army retreated another seven miles. But suddenly there was a
detonation behind the army of Cao Cao, and the rolling of drums as for attack.
Cao Ren hastily called upon his troops to return. They did so; but Guan Ping
and Liao Hua then turned and followed on their heels so that the troops of Cao
Cao were thrown into confusion.
Cao Ren by this time had seen that a trap had been laid and he had fallen
therein, so he hastily marched with one army to Xiangyang. He got to within a
short distance of the city when he saw before him a handsome banner waving in
the wind, and out came Guan Yu with his green-dragon saber ready to slay. Cao
Ren was powerless from fear, and, fighting being impossible, he turned off into
a bye-road for Xiangyang.
Then Xiahou Cun came. He fell into a rage at the sight of the old warrior and
went to fight him. But Xiahou Cun was slain in the first encounter. Zhai Yuan
fled, but Guan Ping pursued and slew him. Then the pursuit was continued, and
the loss of Cao Caoâs side was very heavy. More than half were drowned in
River Xiang. Seeing the situation was desperate, Cao Ren fled to Fancheng. Guan
Yu got possession of Xiangyang.
âYou have obtained this city very easily,â said the Marching General, Wang
Fu, âbut the task is not ended. Cao Caoâs army have been beaten and their
courage broken, but there is danger from the side of Wu. Lu Meng is at Lukou,
and he has long cherished the desire to lay hands on Jingzhou. Suppose he now
attacks: What will happen?â
âI was even thinking of that myself. You may go and attend to this matter.
You will certainly be able to find certain elevated spots on the river bank,
about seven miles apart, suitable for alarm beacons, whence could be signaled
any attempt of the marines of Wu to cross the river. Fifty soldiers could guard
each station. Let there be a flame by night and a smoke by day. If they cross
the river, I must go and smite them.â
Wang Fu replied, âFu Shiren and Mi Fang are defending important places, but
they may not be able to defend the Passes well. There ought to be a commander-
in-chief over Jingzhou City.â
âThere is no need for anxiety. Army Inspector Pan Jun is guarding the
city.â
âThe objection is the character of Pan Jun. He is jealous and selfish and not
a fit person for the task. I think you would do well to replace him by Zhao
Lei, now of the Chief of the Commissariat. Zhao Lei is loyal, trusty, clean-
handed, and straight, a much more desirable man for the post.â
âI know Pan Jun very well, but I have delegated him for that duty and cannot
change now. The work Zhao Lei has to do in the supplies is also most important.
I do not think you need be anxious. Just get along with those beacons for
me.â
Wang Fu, disappointed, took his leave.
Then Guan Ping was bidden to prepare ships ready to cross the river and attack
Fancheng, whither Cao Ren had retired after his defeat.
Now Cao Ren said to Man Chong, âNeglecting your advice, I lost soldiers, two
generals, and the city of Xiangyang. What am I to do now?â
âGuan Yu is very dangerous, too brave and skillful for us to try to defeat.
We had better remain on the defensive,â replied Man Chong.
Just about this time came the tidings that Guan Yu was crossing the river on
the way to attack. Man Chong maintained his policy of defense. But one of Cao
Renâs generals, Lu Chang, was for going out to meet the enemy.
âI ask for a few thousand troops,â said Lu Chang, âand I will meet the
enemy on the way.â
âYou cannot do any good,â said Man Chong.
âAccording to the advice of you and the other bookish officials, there is
only one thing to do. But will defense drive off the enemy? The proper way is
to attack your enemy while he is crossing a river, and as Guan Yu is doing that
now, why not attack? It will be quite another matter if you let him reach the
walls and get possession of the moat.â
As a result of his arguments and protest, Lu Chang got command of two thousand
troops, whom he led to the river. And there he found Guan Yu already arrayed
for battle. Guan Yu at once rode out, and the bold Lu Chang was going to attack
him. But his soldiers were panic-stricken at the sight of Guan Yuâs fierce
countenance and ran away. Lu Chang called them to come back, but they would not
stop, and as Guan Yu came on with a rush, the army of Wei again lost the day.
Many were slain, and the remainder ran into Fancheng. Cao Ren sent off a hasty
messenger for help and a letter to Xuchang to tell what Guan Yu had done and
how Fancheng was in imminent danger of falling.
The letter reached Cao Cao, who chose a certain general among his leaders and
assigned the task, âYou go and defend Fancheng!â
The man at once stepped out and accepted the assignment. He was Yu Jin.
âLet me have another general to lead the van,â said Yu Jin.
âWho volunteers?â asked Cao Cao, looking around.
âI do!â cried a man, âI will give my poor services for what they are
worth. And I will capture this fellow Guan Yu and bring him as an offering
before your standard.â
The soldiers of Wei began the war
Even before Wu had sent out armies.
But who was the man bold enough to say he would capture Guan Yu? For his name
see the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 74 ****
The bold and self-confident leader of Cao Caoâs army who promised to make an
end of Guan Yu was Pang De. Cao Cao was glad to find such a man.
âThat fellow Guan Yu has a great reputation, and in the whole empire he has
no rival. He has not met his match yet, but now you are going, he will find all
his work cut out.â
So spoke Cao Cao. He conferred on Yu Jin the title of General Who Corrects the
South and on Pang De that of General Who Corrects the West, and he made Pang De
Leader of the Van. The two generals marched out with their seven armies to
Fancheng.
These seven armies were composed of sturdy fellows from the north, led by two
of their own Marching Commanders named Dong Heng and Dong Chao. Hearing who was
to command them, these two, supported by their generals, went to see Yu Jin and
represented that the Leader of the Van was unsuitable.
Dong Heng said, âSir General, the expedition you lead is for the relief of
Fancheng, and it can confidently expect victory. But is it wise to place such
as Pang De in command of the van?â
âWhy?â said Yu Jin, surprised.
âBecause Pang De was once under the command of Ma Chao. He had no alternative
but to surrender and fight for Wei. But his former chief is now in high honor
in Shu, one of the Five Tiger Generals, and his own brother Pang Rou is there,
too, as an officer. To send Pang De as Leader of the Van just now seems like
trying to extinguish a fire with oil. Would it not be well to inform the Prince
of Wei and ask him to exchange this man for another?â
Without further argument or delay, Yu Jin went to see the Prince and laid
before him the objections to Pang Deâs appointment. As soon as Cao Cao
understood, he summoned Pang De to the steps and bade him yield his seal as
Leader of the Van.
âO Prince, why do you reject my services? I was just about to do my best for
you.â
âI do not doubt you, but Ma Chao is now in the west, and your brother also
â-both in the service of Liu Bei. I myself have no doubts, but it is what all
the crowd are saying. What can I do?â
Pang De took off his headdress and prostrated himself, bitter tears rolling
down his cheeks.
âSince I surrendered to you, O Prince, I have experienced much kindness, so
that I would undergo any sufferings to show my gratitude. I hope you will trust
me. When my brother and I were at home together, his wife was a wicked woman,
and I slew her while I was drunk. My brother has never forgiven me, but is
permeated with hate for me. He swears never to see me again, and we are
enemies. For my old master, Ma Chao, I have profound contempt. He is bold, but
only that, and was in a pitiable and dejected state when he found his way to
the west. Now, like me, he serves his own master, but our friendship is at an
end. How could I think of another after your kindness to me?â
Cao Cao raised Pang De from the ground and soothed him, saying, âI have
always known what a noble man you are, and what I said just now was to satisfy
the feelings of other people. Now you can strive to win fame. If you do not
turn your back on me, I shall not on you.â
Then Pang De took his leave and returned to his house, where he ordered the
artificers to make him a coffin. Next he invited all his friends to a banquet,
and the coffin was set out in the reception room for all to see.
And they asked one another, âWhat can that inauspicious thing mean putting
out on the eve of a campaign?â
By and by, drinking to them, Pang De said, âThe Prince of Wei has been
generous to me, and I am pledged to show my gratitude to the death. I am about
to go out against this Guan Yu, and I have to kill him or he must kill me. If
he does not kill me, I must commit suicide, and so I have prepared what is
necessary. I will not return leaving my task unachieved.â
The terrible omen saddened the guests, and they fell to sighing. Then Pang De
called in his wife, Lady Li, and bade her bring their son Pang Hui, whom he
commended to her care.
âI have been appointed Leader of the Van of this new expedition against Guan
Yu, and my duty bids me seek death or glory on the battlefield. If I die, our
son is in your special care. Alas, the child has been born ill-starred, and
when he grows up he will have to avenge a father.â
Both mother and son wept as they bade him farewell. When the army marched, the
coffin was carried in its train.
Pang De bade his officers, saying, âI will fight to the end with Guan Yu.
Place my body therein if I fall in combat. And if I slay him, then will I bring
his head in this coffin as an offering to our Prince.â
Then out spoke his five hundred veterans and said, âIf you are like this, O
General, then we also will follow you to the end.â
The vanguard then marched away.
A certain man told the story of these happenings to Cao Cao, who was very
pleased, saying, âI have no anxiety with such a general to lead my armies.â
But Jia Xu said, âI am anxious for Pang Deâs safety. He is over-bold and
imprudent to fight with Guan Yu to the death.â
Cao Cao thought such an act would be unwise, and he hastily sent a messenger
with an edict warning Pang De against his antagonist.
âThis Guan Yu lacks neither cunning nor valor. You are to be most cautious in
engaging him. If you can conquer, then conquer; but if there be any doubt,
remain on the defensive.â
âHow highly does our Prince regard this fellow Guan Yu!â said Pang De to
his officers when he heard this new command. âBut I think I shall be able to
take the keen edge off his thirty-year reputation.â
âThe command of the Prince is to be obeyed,â said Yu Jin.
Pang De hastened to Fancheng in all the pomp and panoply of war, his gongs
clanging, his drums rolling as he marched.
Guan Yu was sitting in his tent when his spies came to report: âSeven armies
of the north under Yu Jin are approaching. They are ten miles away. The Van
Leader is Pang De, who brings with him a coffin. As he marches, he slanders
you, General, and vows to fight a decisive battle with you.â
Rage took possession of Guan Yu. His face changed color, his beard shook, and
he roared out, âThere is never a fighting man in all the world who has heard
my name without trembling. Does this fellow dare disdain me?â
Then he ordered Guan Ping to attack Fancheng while he went out to slay the
impudent boaster who dared him.
âFather,â said Guan Ping, âTaishan Mountain in its majesty does not
quarrel with a pebble. Let me go and fight this Pang De.â
âWell, my son, go and try. I will support you.â
So Guan Ping took his sword, mounted his steed, and went out with his troops.
Both sides being drawn up for battle. On the side of Wei there flew a single
black flag on which was inscribed Pang De, Corrector of the West in white. The
leader himself wore a blue robe with a silver helmet and rode a white charger.
He stood out in front backed by his five hundred veterans, and a few foot
soldiers were there too, bearing the gruesome coffin.
Guan Ping was very angry, crying out, âTurncoat! Traitor!â
âWho is that?â asked Pang De of his followers.
A certain one replied, âThat is Guan Yuâs adopted son, Guan Ping.â
Pang De cried, âI have an edict from the Prince of Wei to take your
fatherâs head. You are but a weakling, and I will spare you. But call your
father!â
Guan Ping dashed forward flourishing his sword. Pang De went to meet him, and
there followed thirty odd bouts with no advantage to either.
Both sides then drew off to rest. Soon the news of this combat reached Guan Yu,
and he was not pleased. He sent Liao Hua to assault the city while he went to
do battle with Pang De. Guan Ping met his father and related the story of the
indecisive fight.
So Guan Yu rode out with his green-dragon saber ready, and he shouted to Pang
De, âCome quickly and be slain!â
The drums reechoed as Pang De rode out and replied, âThe edict from the
Prince of Wei tells me to take your head. In case you disbelieve it, here is
the coffin ready to receive it. If you fear death, down from your horse and
surrender!â
âI hold you for a simple fool!â cried Guan Yu. âWhat can you do? It is a
pity to stain my blade with the blood of such a rat.â
Then he galloped Red Hare out toward Pang De, flourishing the saber. Pang De
whirled his blade and came to meet him, and they two fought a hundred bouts.
And as they fought, the lust of battle seemed to grow and both armies were lost
in amazement.
But the army of Wei began to fear for their champion, and the gongs sounded the
retirement. At the same time Guan Ping began to think of his fatherâs
fatigue, and his gongs clanged too. So that both armies drew off at the same
time.
âPeople rumor Guan Yu is a mighty man of war. Today I really believe that,â
said Pang De, when he had got back among his own line.
Then his chief, Yu Jin, came to see him and said, âO General, you fought the
great combat of a hundred bouts, which ended indecisively. I think it would be
prudent to retire out of his way, and therefore blunting his spirit.â
But Pang De replied haughtily, âWhat makes you so soft? Yet the Prince gave
you the command of the seven armies! But tomorrow I will fight again and that
to the death. I swear I will never give way.â
Yu Jin could not overcome Pang Deâs decision, so he went back to his own
camp.
When Guan Yu had got back to his camp, he extolled Pang De, saying, âHis
swordsmanship is perfect. He is my worthy enemy.â
âThe new-born calf fears not the tiger,â said Guan Ping. âBut if you slay
this fellow, my father, you have only killed a common soldier of the Qiang
tribes beyond the frontier. If any accident occurs, then you will have the
reproach of not having considered your brotherâs charge.â
âHow can my resentment be assuaged save by the death of this man?â returned
Guan Yu. âI have decided to fight, so say no more.â
Next day Guan Yu took the field first, and Pang De quickly came out. Both
arrayed their troops and then went to the front at the same moment. This time
neither spoke, but the combat began forthwith. It went on for fifty bouts, and
then Pang De pulled his horse, sheathed his sword, and fled. Guan Yu went in
pursuit, and Guan Ping followed lest there should be need of him.
Guan Yu roared out reviling to his flying foe, âTraitor! You want to use the
âswinging-horse stabâ, but here I am, never afraid of that.â
But the fact was that Pang De had only pretended to try for a foul stroke in
order to cover a resort to his bow. He pulled in his horse, fitted an arrow to
the string, and was just on the point of shooting when Guan Ping, who was
sharp-eyed, shouted out a warning.
âThe bandit is going to shoot!â
Guan Yu saw it, but the bowstring twanged, and the arrow came flying. He was
not nimble enough to avoid it, and it wounded his left arm. Guan Ping at once
went to his fatherâs assistance and led him away to the camp. Pang De wished
to follow up this advantage and came back whirling his sword, but, ere he could
strike, the gongs of his own side rang out. He thought there was something
amiss in the rear and stopped.
The signal for retreat had been sounded by Yu Jin out of jealousy, for he had
seen that Guan Yu had been wounded, and he grudged his colleague the glory
which would eclipse his own. Pang De obeyed, but when he got back, he wanted to
know why retreat had been sounded on the very verge of a great success.
âWhy did the gongs clang?â asked Pang De.
âBecause of our Princeâs warning. Though Guan Yu was wounded, I feared some
trick on his part. He is very cunning.â
âI should have killed him if you had not done that,â said Pang De.
âHaste makes slow going. You can postpone your fight with him,â said Yu
Jin.
Pang De, though ignorant of the real reason why he was made to miss success at
the critical moment, was still very vexed.
Guan Yu went back to camp, and the arrow-head was puled out of the wound.
Happily it had not penetrated very deeply, and the usual remedies against
injuries by metal were applied.
Guan Yu was very bitter against his enemy and declared, âI swear I will have
my revenge for this arrow.â
âNever mind anything but recovering now,â said his officers. âRest and
get well; then you may fight again.
Before long, Pang De renewed his challenge, and Guan Yu was for going out to
fight; however, he yielded to the entreaties of his officers. And when Pang De
set his soldiers to reviling the warrior, Guan Ping saw to it that his father
never heard it. After ten days of challenges hurled uselessly at an army that
ignored them, Pang De took council with Yu Jin.
âEvidently Guan Yu is helpless from the effects of that arrow-wound. We ought
to advance all our seven armies against him while he is ill and destroy his
camp. Thereby we shall relieve Fancheng.â
Thus spoke Pang De, but jealousy of the glory that might accrue to his next in
command again made Yu Jin urge caution and obedience to the command of the
Prince of Wei. Yu Jin refused to move his army in spite of Pang Deâs repeated
persuasion. Still more, Yu Jin led the armies to a new camping ground behind
the hills some three miles north of Fancheng. There his own army prevented
communication by the main road, while he sent Pang De into a valley in the rear
so that Pang De could do nothing.
To Guan Pingâs great joy, Guan Yuâs wound soon healed. Soon after they
heard of Yu Jinâs new camp, and as Guan Ping could assign no reason for the
change, and suspected some ruse, he told his father, who went up to a high
place to reconnoiter.
Looking round, Guan Yu noted that there seemed much slackness about everything
â-from flags to soldiers â-in Fancheng, that the relief armies were camped
in a valley to the north, and that River Xiang seemed to run very swiftly.
After impressing the topography on his mind, he called the guides and asked the
name of the gully about three miles north of the city.
âZengkou Stream,â was the reply.
He chuckled.
âI shall capture Yu Jin,â said he.
Those with him asked how he knew that.
He replied, âWhy, how can any fish last long in such a trap?â
Those in his train gave but little weight to what he said, and presently he
went back to his own tent. It was just then the time for the autumn rains, and
a heavy downpour came on, lasting several days. Orders were given to get ready
boats and rafts and such things. Guan Ping could not think what such
preparations meant in a dry land campaign. So he asked his father.
âDo you not know even?â replied his father. âOur enemies have camped in
difficult ground instead of the open country and are crowded in the dangerous
valley there. After some days of this rain, River Xiang will swell, and I shall
send people to dam up all the outlets and so let the water rise very high. When
at its highest, I shall open the dams and let the water out over Fancheng. That
valley will be flooded too, and all the soldiers will become aquatic
animals.â
The Wei armies had camped in the gully, and after several days of heavy rain,
Army Inspector Cheng He ventured to speak to his commander.
He said, âThe army is camped near the mouth of a stream in a depression.
There are hills around us, but they are too far off to keep the water away. Our
soldiers are already suffering from these heavy rains, and, moreover, they say
the Jingzhou troops have moved to higher ground. More than that, at River Han
they are preparing boats and rafts so that they can take advantage of the
floods if there are any. Our army will be in great danger, and something should
be done.â
But Yu Jin scoffed at his words, saying, âYou fool! Do you want to injure the
spirit of our soldiers? Talk no more, or your head will be fallen.â
Cheng He went away greatly ashamed.
Then Cheng He went to Pang De, who saw the force of his words and said, âWhat
you said is excellent. If Yu Jin will not move camp tomorrow, I myself will do
so.â
So Cheng He left it at that.
That night there came a great storm. As Pang De sat in his tent, he heard the
sound as of ten thousand horses in stampede and a roar as of the drums of war
seeming to shake the earth. He was alarmed, left his tent, and mounted his
charger to go and see what it meant. Then he saw the rolling waters coming in
from every side and the seven armies flying from the flood, which speedily rose
to the height of ten spans. Yu Jin, Pang De, and several other officers sought
safety by rushing up the hills.
As day dawned, Guan Yu and his marines came along in large boats with flags
flying and drums beating. Yu Jin saw no way of escape, and his following was
reduced to about fifty or sixty soldiers. They all said they surrendered. Guan
Yu made them strip and then took them on board.
After that he went to capture Pang De, who was standing on a hillock with Dong
Heng, Dong Chao, Cheng He, and his five hundred troops, all without armors.
Pang De saw his archenemy approach without a sign of fear, and even went boldly
to meet him. Guan Yu surrounded the party with his boats, and the archers began
to shoot. When more than half the troops had been struck down, the survivors
became desperate.
Dong Heng and Dong Chao pressed their chief to give in, saying, âWe have lost
more than half of our men. Surrender is the only course!â
But Pang De only raged, saying, âI have received great kindness from the
Prince. Think you that I will bow the head to any other?â
Pang De cut down Dong Heng and Dong Chao right in the battlefield and then
shouted, âAnyone who says surrender shall be as these two!â
So the survivors made a desperate effort to beat off their enemies, and they
held their own up to midday. Then Guan Yuâs marines redoubled their efforts,
and the arrows and stones rained down upon the defenders, who fought
desperately hand to hand with their assailants.
âThe valorous leader fears death less than desertion; the brave warrior does
not break faith to save his life!â cried Pang De. âThis is the day of my
death, but I will fight on to the last. And you, General, should fight to your
end, too.â
So Cheng He pressed on till he fell into the water by an arrow of Guan Yu, and
then the soldiers yielded.
Pang De fought on. Then one of the boats happened to close in to the bank. With
a tremendous leap Pang De lighted on it and slashed at the marines, killing ten
of them. The others jumped overboard and swam away. Then Pang De one hand still
holding his sword, tried to maneuver the boat across the river to Fancheng. But
there came drifting down a raft, which collided with and upset his boat so that
he was struggling in the water. Next a general on the raft jumped into the
water, gripped him, put him on the boat again.
The captor was Zhou Cang, a skillful waterman who, having lived in Jingzhou for
many years, was thoroughly expert in boat navigation. Beside, he was very
powerful and so was able to make Pang De a prisoner.
In this flood perished the whole of the seven armies, except the few that saved
themselves by swimming. These latter, having no way of escape, surrendered to
the victors.
In the depth of night rolled the war drums,
Summoning the warriors as to battle;
But the enemy was no man,
For the waters had risen and the flood came.
This was the plan of Guan Yu, the crafty,
To drown his enemies. More than human
was he in cunning. The ages hand on his fame
As his glory was told in his own day.
Guan Yu then returned to the higher ground, where his tent was pitched and
therein took his seat to receive his prisoners. The lictors brought up Yu Jin,
who prostrated himself humbly.
âHow dared you think to oppose me? To execute you would be like killing a
hog. It would be soiling weapons for nothing,â said Guan Yu, stroking his
beard.
Yu Jin was hound and sent to the prison in Jingzhou.
âI will decide your fate when I return,â said Guan Yu.
The general having thus dealt with the chief, Pang De was sent for. He came,
pride and anger flashing from his eyes. He did not kneel but stood boldly
erect.
âYou have a brother in Hanzhong, and your old chief was Ma Chao, also in high
honor in Shu. Would you not better join them?â
âRather than surrender to you, I would perish beneath the sword,â cried
Pang De.
He reviled his captors without ceasing till, losing patience at last, Guan Yu
sent him to his death. Pang De was beheaded. He stretched out his neck for the
headsmanâs sword. Out of pity he was honorably buried.
The floods were still out, and taking advantage of them, the troops of Jingzhou
boarded the boats to move toward Fancheng, which now stood out as a mere island
with waves breaking against the walls.
The force of the waters being great, the city wall was beginning to give way,
and the whole population, male and female, aged and young, were carrying mud
and bricks to strengthen it. Their efforts seemed vain, and the leaders of Cao
Caoâs army were very desperate.
Some of the generals went to see Cao Ren, who said, âNo ordinary personâs
strength can fend off todayâs danger. If we can hold out till nightfall, we
may escape by boat. We shall lose the city, but we shall save our skins.â
But Man Chong interposed before the boats could be got ready.
He said, âNo! No! Though the force of these mountainous waters is great, we
only have to wait ten days or so, and the flood will have passed. Though Guan
Yu has not assaulted this city, yet he has sent another army to Jiaxia, which
indicates he dares not advance lest we should fall upon his rear. Remember,
too, that to retire from this city means the abandonment of everything south of
the Yellow River. Therefore I decide that you defend this place.â
Cao Ren saluted Man Chong as he concluded his harangue, saying, âWhat a
tremendous error I should have committed had it not been for you, Sir!â
Then riding his white charger he went up on the city walls, gathered his
officers around him, and pledged himself not to surrender.
âThe Princeâs command being to defend this city, I shall defend it to the
last. And I shall put to death anyone who even mentions abandonment,â said
he.
âAnd we desire to defend it to out last gasp,â chimed in his officers.
Then they saw to it that the means of offense were good. Many hundreds of
archers and crossbowmen were stationed on the wall and kept watch night and
day. The old and the young of ordinary people were made to carry earth and
stones to strengthen the wall.
After some ten days the flood was at an end. Then the news of Guan Yuâs
success against the Wei campaign got abroad, and the terror of his name spread
wider and wider. About the same time, too, his second son, Guan Xing, came to
visit his father in camp. Guan Yu thought this a good opportunity to send his
report of success to Capital Chengdu and entrusted to Guan Xing a dispatch
mentioning each officerâs services and requesting promotion for them. Guan
Xing accordingly took leave of his father and left.
After Guan Xingâs departure, the army was divided into two halves, one under
Guan Yu to attack Fancheng, and the other to go to Jiaxia.
One day Guan Yu rode over to the north gate. Halting his steed, he pointed with
his whip toward the defenders on the wall, and called out, âYou lot of rats
will not give in then! What are you waiting for?â
Cao Ren, who was among his soldiers on the wall, saw that Guan Yu had no armor
on, so he ordered his men to shoot. The archers and bowmen at once sent a great
flight of arrows and bolts that way. Guan Yu hastily pulled the reins to
retire, but an arrow struck him in the arm. The shock of the blow made him turn
in the saddle, and he fell from his horse.
Just now a mighty army perished
By the riverâs overflow;
A crossbow bolt from the city wall
Lays a valiant warrior low.
What further befell Guan Yu will be told in the next chapter.

**** Chapter 75 ****
the city to follow up with an attack, but Guan Ping drove him off and escorted
his father back to camp. There the arrow was extracted, but the arrow head had
been poisoned. The wound was deep, and the poison had penetrated to the bone.
The right arm was discolored and swollen and useless.
Guan Ping consulted with the other leaders and proposed, saying, âAs fighting
is impossible for the moment, we should withdraw to Jingzhou, where my
fatherâs wound can be treated.â
Having decided upon this, they went to see the wounded warrior.
âWhat have you come for?â asked Guan Yu when they entered.
âConsidering that you, Sir, have been wounded in the right arm, we fear the
result of the excitement of battle. Moreover, you can hardly take part in a
fight just now, and we therefore propose that the army retire till you are
recovered.â
Guan Yu replied angrily, âI am on the point of taking the city, and if I
succeed, I must press forward to Capital Xuchang, and destroy that brigand Cao
Cao, so that the Hans may be restored to their own. Think you that I can
vitiate the whole campaign because of a slight wound? Would you dishearten the
army?â
Guan Ping and his colleagues said no more, but somewhat unwillingly withdrew.
Seeing that their leader would not retire and the wound showed no signs of
healing, the various generals inquired far and near for a good surgeon to
attend their general.
One day a person arrived in a small ship and, having landed and come up to the
gate of the camp, was led in to see Guan Ping. The visitor wore a square-cut
cap and a loose robe. In his hand he carried a small black bag.
He said, âMy name is Hua Tuo, and I belong to Qiao. I have heard of the wound
sustained by the famous general and have come to heal it.â
âSurely you must be the physician who treated Zhou Tai in the South Land,â
said Guan Ping.
âI am.â
Taking with him the other generals, Guan Ping went in to see his father. Guan
Yu was engaging in a game of chess with Ma Liang, although his arm was very
painful. But Guan Yu kept up appearances so as not to discourage the troops.
When they told him that a physician had come, he consented to see him.
Hua Tuo was introduced, asked to take a seat and, after the tea of ceremony,
was shown the injured arm.
âThis was caused by an arrow,â said the doctor. âThere is poison in the
wound, and it has penetrated to the bone. Unless the wound is soon treated, the
arm will become useless.â
âWhat do you propose to do?â asked Guan Yu.
âI know how to cure the wound, but I think you will be afraid of the
remedy.â
âAm I likely to be afraid of that when I am not even afraid of death? Death
is only a return home after all.â
Then Hua Tuo said, âThis is what I shall do. In a private room I shall erect
a post with a steel ring attached. I shall ask you, Sir, to insert your arm in
the ring, and I shall bind it firmly to the post. Then I shall cover your head
with a quilt so that you cannot see, and with a scalpel I shall open up the
flesh right down to the bone. Then I shall scrape away the poison. This done, I
shall dress the wound with a certain preparation, sew it up with a thread, and
there will be no further trouble. But I think you may quail at the severity of
the treatment.â
Guan Yu smiled.
âIt all sounds easy enough,â said he. âBut why the post and the ring?â
Refreshments were then served, and after a few cups of wine, the warrior
extended his arm for the operation. With his other hand he went on with his
game of chess. Meanwhile the surgeon prepared his knife and called a lad to
hold a basin beneath the limb.
âI am just going to cut. Do not start,â said Hua Tuo.
âWhen I consented to undergo the treatment, did you think I was afraid of
pain?â
The surgeon then performed the operation as he had pre-described. He found the
bone much discolored, but he scraped it clean. When the knife went over the
surface of the bone and made horrible sounds, all those near covered their eyes
and turned pale. But Guan Yu went on with his game, only drinking a cup of wine
now and again, and his face betrayed no sign of pain.
When the wound had been cleansed, sewn up and dressed, the patient stood up
smiling and said, âThis arm is now as good as it ever was. There is no pain.
Indeed, Master, you are a marvel.â
âI have spent my life in the art,â said Hua Tuo, âbut I have never seen
such a patient as you, Sir. You are as if not from the earth but heaven.â
Here as surgeons, there physicians, all boast their skill;
Bitter few are those that cure one when oneâs really ill.
As for superhuman valor rivals Guan Yu had none,
So for holy touch in healing Hua Tuo stood alone.
When the cure was well advanced, Guan Yu gave a fine banquet in honor of Hua
Tuo and offered him a fee of a hundred ounces of gold.
But Hua Tuo declined it, saying, âI had come to treat you, O General, from
admiration of your great virtue and not for money. Although your wound is
cured, you must be careful of your health, and especially avoid all excitement
for a hundred days, when you will be as well as ever you were.â
Then Hua Tuo, having prepared dressings for the wound, took his leave, refusing
fees to the very last.
Having captured Yu Jin and accomplished the death of Pang De, Guan Yu became
more famous and more fear-inspiring through the empire than even before. Cao
Cao called together his advisers to help him decide upon what he should do.
Said Cao Cao, âI must acknowledge this Guan Yu as the one man who, in skill
and valor, overtops the whole world. Lately he has obtained possession of
Jingzhou and the territory near it, and has so become very terrible. He is a
tiger with wings added. Pang De is no more; Yu Jin is his prisoner; the armies
of Wei have lost their morale; and if he led his armies to Xuchang, we should
be helpless. I can only think of avoiding the peril by removal of the capital.
What think you?â
âNo, do not take that step,â said Sima Yi, rising to reply. âYu Jin and
all the others you lost were victims of the flood and slain in battle. These
losses do no harm at all to your great plan. The Suns and Lius are no longer
friends since Guan Yu has accomplished his desire. You may send a messenger
into Wu to foment the quarrel and cause Sun Quan to send his armies to attack
the army of Guan Yu from the rear, promising that, when things are tranquil,
you will reward the south to Sun Quan. In this way you will relieve
Fancheng.â
Here Minister Jiang Ji said, âSima Yi speaks well, and the messenger should
lose no time. Do not move the capital and disturb the people.â
Cao Cao therefore did not carry out his first proposal.
But he was sad at the loss of Yu Jin, and spoke of him affectionately, âYu
Jin had followed me faithfully for thirty years, yet in that moment of truth he
was less than Pang De.â
It was necessary to send someone with the letters to Wu and also to find
another leader willing to face Guan Yu. Cao Cao had not long to wait for the
latter, as an officer stepped out from the ranks of those in waiting and
offered himself. It was Xu Huang.
Xu Huangâs offer was accepted, and he was given fifty thousand of veterans.
Lu Qian was sent as his second, and the army marched to Yangling Slope, where
they halted to see if any support was coming from the southeast.
Sun Quan fell in with the scheme of Cao Cao as soon as he had read Cao Caoâs
letter. He at once prepared a reply for the messenger to take back, and then
gathered his officers, civil and military, to consult. Zhang Zhao was the first
speaker.
âWe know Guan Yu has captured one leader and slain another. This has added
greatly to his fame and reputation. Cao Cao was going to move the capital
rather than risk an attack. We also know that Fancheng is in imminent danger.
Cao Cao has asked for our help; but when he has gained his end, I doubt whether
he will hold to his promise.â
Before Sun Quan had replied they announced the arrival of Lu Meng, who had come
in a small ship from Lukou with a special message. He was at once called in and
asked what it was.
Said Lu Meng, âThe armies of Guan Yu being absent at Fancheng, the
opportunity should be taken to attack Jingzhou.â
âBut I wish to attack Xuzhou in the north. What of this plan?â said Sun
Quan.
âIt would be better to attack Jingzhou, and so get control of the Great
River. Cao Cao is far away to the north and too occupied to regard the east.
Xuzhou is weakly held and could be taken easily, but the lie of the land favors
the use of an army rather than a navy force. If you capture it, it will not be
easy to hold. But once you hold Jingzhou, you can evolve other schemes.â
âReally, my desire was to attack Jingzhou, but I wished to hear what you
would say to the other plan. Now, Sir, make me a plan speedily, and I will act
upon it.â
So Lu Meng took his leave and went back to Lukou. But soon they heard that Guan
Yu had had beacon towers erected at short distances all along the Great River,
and that the army of Jingzhou was being put into most efficient condition.
âIf this is so, it is hard to make a plan that will ensure success,â said
Lu Meng. âI have already advised my master to attack Jingzhou, but I am
unable to meet this complication.â
Therefore he made illness an excuse to stay at home, and sent to inform Sun
Quan, who was very distressed at the news.
Then said Lu Xun, âThe illness is feigned. He is quite well.â
âIf you know that so well, go and see,â said Sun Quan.
Away went Lu Xun and speedily arrived at Lukou, where he saw Lu Meng, who
indeed appeared to be in perfect health. Nor did his face bear any signs of
recent illness.
âThe Marquis of Wu has sent me to inquire after your honorable complaint,â
said Lu Xun.
âHow distressed I am that the state of my wretched carcass has caused the
Marquis the inconvenience of inquiringâ replied Lu Meng.
âThe Marquis placed a very heavy responsibility on your shoulders, but you
are not making the best use of the opportunity. However, what is the real
origin of your distress?â
Lu Meng sat gazing at his visitor a long time without replying.
âI have a little remedy,â said Lu Xun. âDo you think you might use it?â
Lu Meng dismissed the servants, and when the two were alone, he said, âThis
remedy, my friend, please tell me what it is.â
âYour ailment is due simply to the efficiency of the Jingzhou soldiers. I
know how to keep the beacons from flaring, and I can make the defenders of
Jingzhou come to you with their hands tied. Would that cure you?â
âMy friend, you speak as if you saw into my inmost heart. Pray unfold your
good scheme.â
âGuan Yu thinks himself too much of a hero for anyone to dare to face him,
and his only anxiety is yourself. Now you must take advantage of this excuse
you have made of illness actually to resign this post, so that the pretense may
be kept up and another person be appointed to your place. Let this person, your
successor, humbly praise Guan Yu till that general becomes so conceited that he
will withdraw all the troops from Jingzhou to send them against Fancheng. When
Jingzhou is left undefended then is our chance, and the city will fall into our
hands.â
âThe plan seems most excellent,â said Lu Meng.
Wherefore Lu Mengâs malady waxed worse, so that he was confined to bed. He
gave Lu Xun his letter of resignation to carry back to Sun Quan. The messenger
hastened back and explained the ruse to his master, who soon after issued a
command for Lu Meng to retire and attend to the recovery of his health.
But Lu Meng came to Sun Quan to discuss the matter of a successor.
Sun Quan said to him, âAs to the appointment at Lukou, you know Zhou Yu
recommended Lu Su, who at his last moment proposed you. Now you ought to be
able to mention some other talented and well-known officer to succeed you.â
âIf you choose a well-known man, Guan Yu will certainly be on his guard
against him. Now Lu Xun is deep and farseeing, but he has no widespread fame.
Hence no particular notice would be taken of his appointment and no
countermeasures taken. So he is the most suitable person to send.â
Sun Quan agreed and thereupon promoted Lu Xun to the rank of General of the
Right Army and Admiral of the Right Fleet, and sent him to defend the port.
âI am very young,â said Lu Xun, âand feel unequal to such a post.â
âLu Meng has proposed you, and you will not make any mistakes. Pray do not
decline,â said Sun Quan.
So the appointment was made, and Lu Xun set out at once. When he had assumed
charge of the cavalry, the infantry, and the marines, he set about drawing up a
letter to Guan Yu, and he selected fine horses and beautiful silks and good
wines and delicacies suitable for gifts to go with the letter. He sent all by
the hand of a trusty messenger to Fancheng.
The news of the change of command reached Guan Yu when he lay ill from the
effects of his wound and unable to conduct any military operations. Close upon
the news came the letter and the gifts from Lu Xun, and the bearer was called
in to see the warrior.
âFriend Sun Quan was not very prudent when he made a Commanding General out
of a mere youth,â said Guan Yu, pointing to the messenger.
The messenger said, âGeneral Lu Xun sends this letter and some presents,
which he hopes you will accept. He also sends his felicitations, and would
rejoice if the two houses could become friends.â
Guan Yu read the letter, which was couched in most modest language, and then
threw back his head and laughed aloud. He bade the attendants receive the
various gifts, and sent the bearer away.
The messenger forthwith returned to Lukou and reported to Lu Xun, ï¿½Guan Yu
seemed very gratified, and he felt no anxiety and danger toward the South
Land.ï¿½
Spies were sent out to report on proceedings, and they returned to say that
half the troops of Jingzhou had been sent to assist in the siege of Fancheng.
That city was to be seriously assaulted as soon as Guan Yu had recovered.
This news was promptly sent on to Sun Quan, who at once called in Lu Meng to
decide upon the next move.
âNow is the favorable moment to get possession of Jingzhou,â said Sun Quan.
âI propose to send you and my brother, Sun Jiao, to lead the army.â
This Sun Jiao was really only a cousin, as he was the second son of Sun
Quanâs uncle, Sun Jing.
But Lu Meng objected. âMy lord, if you think to employ me, then employ me
only; if Sun Jiao, then Sun Jiao only. You cannot have forgotten that Zhou Yu
and Cheng Pu were associate commanders, and although the final decision lay
with Zhou Yu, yet the other presumed upon his seniority and there was some
unfriendliness between the two. All ended well because Cheng Pu recognized the
ability of his colleague and so supported him. I know I am not so clever as
Zhou Yu, but Sun Jiaoâs consanguinity will be a greater obstacle than mere
length of service, and I fear he may not be wholly with me.â
Sun Quan saw the force of the contention, and appointed Lu Meng to sole command
with Sun Jiao to help him in the commissariat. Lu Meng thanked his lord for his
commission, soon got his thirty thousand marines together, and assembled eighty
ships for the expedition.
Lu Meng dressed a number of sailors in the plain white costumes of ordinary
merchants and put them on board to work his vessels. He concealed his veterans
in the compartments. He selected seven generals â-Han Dang, Jiang Qin, Zhu
Ran, Pan Zhang, Zhou Tai, Xu Sheng, and Ding Feng â-to serve under him and
settled the order of their successive movements. The remainder of the forces
was left with Sun Quan as supports and reserves. Letters were also written to
Cao Cao that he might cooperate by sending his army to attack Guan Yu in the
rear, and to Lu Xun that he would act in concert.
Then the sailors in plain white dress navigated the ships to River Xunyang as
quickly as possible, and then crossed to the north bank.
When the beacon-keepers came down to question them, the men of Wu said, âWe
are traders forced into the bank by contrary winds.â
And they offered gifts to the beacon-keepers, who accepted them and let the
ships come to an anchor close to the shore.
At about the second watch the soldiers came out of hiding in the holds of the
transports, suddenly fell upon the beacon-keepers and made them prisoners,
officers and soldiers. Next the signal for a general landing was given, and all
the soldiers from the eighty ships went ashore. The guard stations were
attacked, and all the troops captured and carried off to the ships, not one
being allowed to escape. Then the force of Wu hurried off to the city of
Jingzhou, having so far carried out their plans that no one knew of their
coming.
Nearing Jingzhou, Lu Meng spoke kindly to his captives, and gave them gifts and
comforted them in order to induce them to get the gates opened for him to enter
the city. He won them over to his side, and they promised to aid him. They
would show a flare as a signal that the gates were free. So they went in
advance and arrived at the gates about midnight. They called the watch. The
wardens of the gate, recognizing their voices, opened for them. Once within,
they shouted and lit the flares. Immediately the soldiers of Wu came in with a
rush and were soon in possession.
The first order issued by Lu Meng was to spare the people. Instant death should
be the punishment for any murder or robbery. The various officials in the city
were retained in their offices and continued their functions. Special guards
were set over Guan Yuâs family dwelling, and none dared break open any other
house. A messenger was sent with tidings to Sun Quan.
One very wet day Lu Meng, with a few horsemen as escort, was going round the
walls and visiting the gates. One of the soldiers took from a passer-by a
broad-brimmed hat and put it on over his helmet to keep his armor dry. Lu Meng
saw it, and the offender was seized. He was a fellow-villager of Lu Meng, but
that did not save him.
âYou are an old acquaintance, but you knew my order. Why did you disobey
it?â
âI thought the rain would spoil my uniform, and I took the hat to protect it.
I did not take it for my own advantage, but to protect state property. Spare
me, O General, for the sake of our common dwelling-place.â
âI know you were protecting your armor, but still it was disobedience to the
order against taking anything from the people.â
The soldier was beheaded, and his head exposed as a warning. But when all was
over, Lu Meng had the body buried decently and wept at the grave for the loss
of his friend. Never after this was there the least laxity of discipline.
When Sun Quan visited the city, Lu Meng met him at the boundary and led him to
the official residence, where Sun Quan issued rewards and commendations. This
done, Sun Quan ordered Pan Jun to take charge of the new possession. Yu Jin,
who was in prison, was freed and sent back to Cao Cao. When the people had been
comforted and the soldiers rewarded, there was a great banquet in honor of the
success of the expedition.
Then said Sun Quan to Lu Meng, âWe have got the city of Jingzhou, but now Fu
Shiren is holding Gongan and Mi Fang Nanjun. How can we get these two
territories?â
Suddenly Yu Fan started up and offered his services.
âYou will need neither bows nor arrows,â said Yu Fan, âunless my little
tongue is worn out. I can persuade Fu Shiren to surrender.â
âFriend Yu Fan, how will you do it?â asked Sun Quan.
âFu Shiren and I are very old friends, ever since we were boys. If I explain
the matter to him, I am sure he will come over to this side.â
So Yu Fan, with an escort, left quickly for Gongan, where his friend was in
command.
Now when Fu Shiren heard of the capture of Jingzhou, he closed his gates. Yu
Fan arrived, but was refused entrance. So Yu Fan wrote a letter, attached it to
an arrow, and shot it over the city wall. A soldier picked it up and took it to
his commander, who found therein much persuasion to surrender.
Having read all this, he thought within himself, âI think I should do well in
surrender, for at his departure Guan Yu was very bitter against me.â
Without further ado, he bade the wardens open the gate, and his friend came in.
After their greetings they talked of old times, and Yu Fan praised Sun Quanâs
magnanimity and liberality and greatness generally. So finally Fu Shiren
decided to exchange masters and went away, taking with him his seal of office.
He was presented to Sun Quan, who reappointed him to the command of Gongan
under its new lord.
Lu Meng thought the appointment imprudent and said to Sun Quan, âGuan Yu is
yet unconquered. We should not put Fu Shiren in Gongan. Instead, send him to
Nanjun to induce his former colleague and fellow Mi Fang to join him in
desertion to the enemy.â
Lu Mengâs advice was followed, and Fu Shiren was recalled.
âGo to Nanjun and win over Mi Fang, and I will reward you richly,â said Sun
Quan.
Fu Shiren accepted the mission and duly left for Nanjun.
Jingzhouâs defenders failed when tried,
So Wang Fuâs words were justified.
For the events of the journey see the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 76 ****
course, his old colleague Fu Shiren came to see him. Fu Shiren was admitted,
and when asked why he had come, he blurted out his business without beating
about the bush.
âI am faithful enough, but I got into difficulties and danger and could not
hold on, so I have surrendered to Wu. And I advise you to do the same.â
âYou and I have both fed on the bounty of the Prince of Hanzhong, and I
cannot understand how you can turn against him.â
âGuan Yu went away hating both of us intensely. Even if he comes back
victorious, I do not think he will forgive us. Just think it over.â
âMy brother and I have followed the Prince these many years, and I do not
like leaving him like this.â
Mi Fang hesitated.
Before he could make up his mind, there came a messenger, saying, âThe army
in Fancheng is short of grain, and I was sent to demand white rice for the
soldiers. Nanjun and Gongan are to send ten thousand carts at once. Delay will
be most severely punished.â
This sudden demand was a shock to Mi Fang.
âWhere am I to get the rice?â said he despairingly to his friend and
tempter. âJingzhou is now in the hands of Wu.â
âDo not dilly-dally,â said Fu Shiren. Thereupon he drew his sword and slew
the messenger as he stood in the hall.
âWhat have you done?â cried Mi Fang.
âGuan Yu wanted to slay us two and has forced me to this. Are we to fold our
hands and await death? Either you give in at once and go over to Wu, or you
will be put to death by Guan Yu.â
Just then they heard that Lu Mengâs troops had actually reached the city
wall. Mi Fang saw that nothing could save his life but desertion, so he went
out with Fu Shiren and gave in his allegiance to Lu Meng, by whom he was led to
Sun Quan. Sun Quan gave both of them presents, after which he proceeded to
restore order and to reward his army for their services.
At the time that great discussion about Jingzhou was going on in Xuchang, a
messenger arrived with a letter from Sun Quan. It told the plan of attacking
Jingzhou and begged Cao Cao to send an army to attack Guan Yu in the rear,
enjoining the utmost secrecy.
Cao Cao summoned his advisers to a meeting for consultation.
First Secretary Dong Zhao said, âNow that Fancheng is surrounded, it would be
well to shoot letter into the city to let the besieged know, so that they may
not yield to depression. Then we will inform Guan Yu of the danger from the
south. If Guan Yu hears that Jingzhou is threatened by Wu, he will come back to
try to defend it. Then let Xu Huang take the chance to attack, and our victory
will be complete.â
Cao Cao agreed that the plan was good, and so he sent a messenger to urge Xu
Huang to attack. Cao Cao himself led a large force to Yangling Slope, south of
Luoyang, to rescue Cao Ren.
Xu Huang was sitting in his tent when they told him that a messenger from the
Prince of Wei had arrived.
The messenger was called in and said, âThe Prince has led an army to Luoyang,
and he wishes you to hasten to attack Guan Yu in order to relieve Fancheng.â
Just then the scouts came to report: âGuan Ping has encamped at Yencheng and
Liao Hua at Sizhong. The enemy have built a line of twelve stockades.â
Xu Huang ordered two of his generals â-Lu Qian and Xu Shang â-to Yencheng
to masquerade as if he himself was in command, by showing his ensigns. Xu Huang
himself, at the head of five hundred veterans, went along River Mian to attack
Yencheng in the rear.
When Guan Ping heard of the approach of Xu Huang, he prepared his own division
to meet him. When both sides were arrayed, Guan Ping rode out and engaged Xu
Shang. After three encounters Xu Shang had the worst of it and fled. Then the
other general, Lu Qian, went out. He fought half a dozen bouts and also ran
away. Thereupon Guan Ping went in pursuit and smote the flying enemy for seven
miles. But then there was an alarm of fire within Yencheng, and Guan Ping knew
that he had been inveigled into the pursuit and was a victim. So he turned and
set out for the city again. On his way he met a body of troops, and standing
under the great standard was Xu Huang.
Xu Huang shouted out, âGuan Ping, my worthy nephew, it is strange that you do
not recognize death when it stares you in the face. Your Jingzhou has fallen
into the hands of Wu, and yet you act so madly.â
Guan Ping, whirling his sword, just rode hard at Xu Huang, and they engaged.
But after the third bout there was a tremendous shouting among the soldiers,
for the flames within the city burst up higher than before. Guan Ping could not
follow up his desire to continue the fight, but cut his way out and made a dash
for Sizhong, where Liao Hua received him with the news of the disaster to
Jingzhou.
âPeople say that Jingzhou has fallen to Lu Meng, and the news has frightened
the whole army. What is to be done?â said Liao Hua.
âIt is only a malicious rumor. Do not let it spread. If anyone repeats it,
put him to death.â
Just then a man came running in to say that Xu Huang was attacking the first
stockade on the north.
âIf that goes,â said Guan Ping, âthe remainder will follow. But as we
have River Mian at our back, they will not dare attack this. Let us go to the
rescue.â
So Liao Hua summoned his subordinate leaders and gave them orders to hold the
camp and make a signal if the enemy came.
âThere is no danger here,â said they. âThe camp is defended by a tenfold
line of thorny barriers. Even a bird could not get in.â
Guan Ping and Liao Hua mustered all the veterans they had and went away to the
first stockade.
Seeing the Wei soldiers camped on a low hill, Guan Ping said to his colleague,
âThose soldiers are stationed in an unsafe place. Let us raid their camp
tonight.â
âYou take half the force, General, and I will remain to keep the camp,â
said Liao Hua.
When night fell, the attacking force went out. But on reaching the camp not a
man opposed them. The camp was empty. Then Guan Ping knew he had been deceived,
and turned to retreat. He was at once attacked on two sides by Xu Shang and Lu
Qian from left and right. Unable to stand, his troops ran for the camp. The
soldiers of Wei followed, and presently the camp was surrounded. They were
compelled to abandon the position and set off for Sizhong. As they drew near
they saw torches, and presently knew by the ensigns displayed that the camp had
also fallen to the enemy. Retiring, they hastened along the high road toward
Fancheng, but presently their way was barred by a force under Xu Huang himself.
By dint of hard fighting they got away and returned to their main camp, and
Guan Ping went to his father.
Said he, âXu Huang has got possession of Yencheng. Cao Caoâs main army is
on the way in three divisions. And many say that Jingzhou is in the enemyâs
hands.â
Guan Yu bade him be silent.
âThis is a fabrication of the enemy,â said Guan Yu, âbut it may
dishearten the soldiers. We know Lu Meng is ill, and they have appointed that
impractical fellow Lu Xun to succeed him at Lukou. There is nothing to fear.â
Then news came that Xu Huang had arrived . At once Guan Yu bade them saddle his
charger.
âFather, you are not strong enough to go into the battle,â said Guan Ping.
âXu Huang and I were once friends, and I know what he can do and not do. I
will give him the chance to retire. If he does not take it, then I shall just
slay him as a warning to the others.â
Mounting his charger, Guan Yu rode out as impetuously as of yore, and the sight
of the old warrior made to quake the hearts of the troops of Wei.
When he came close enough to his enemy, Guan Yu checked his steed and said,
âWhere is my friend Xu Huang?â
As a reply, the gate of the battle opened, and Xu Huang appeared under the
standard.
With a low bow Xu Huang said, âSome years have passed since I met you, Most
Excellent Marquis, but I had not expected to see you so gray. I have not
forgotten the old brave days, when we were together and you taught me so much,
and I am very grateful. Your new fame has spread throughout the whole empire,
and your old friends cannot but praise you. I am indeed glad that I have the
happiness to see you.â
Guan Yu replied, âWe have been excellent friends, Xu Huang â-better than
most. But why have you pressed my son so hardly of late?â
Xu Huang suddenly turned to the officers about him and cried fiercely, âI
would give a thousand ounces of gold for this Guan Yuâs head.â
Guan Yu, greatly shocked, said, âWhat did you say that for?â
âBecause today I am on state business, and I have no inclination to let
private friendship override my public duty.â
As he said this, he whirled his battle-ax and rode at Guan Yu, who, greatly
enraged, threw up his great saber to strike. They fought a half score bouts,
but although his skill lacked nothing of its pristine vigor and excelled all
the world, the veteran warriorâs right arm was still weak from the wound.
Guan Ping saw that his father failed somewhat, and so hastily beat the gong for
retreat. Guan Yu rode back.
Suddenly the noise of a great shouting was heard. It came from the troops in
Fancheng, for Cao Ren, having heard of the arrival of troops of his own side,
had made a sortie and was about to attack to help Xu Huang. His army fell on,
and the army of Jingzhou were routed. Guan Yu, with as many of his officers as
could, fled away along the banks of River Xiang, hotly pursued by the army of
Wei. Crossing the river, he made for Xiangyang.
Suddenly the scouts reported: âJingzhou has been taken by Lu Meng. Your
family is now in the hand of enemy.â
Guan Yu was shocked. Thence he marched for Gongan.
But the scouts told him: âFu Shiren has yielded Gongan to the hands of Wu.â
Then some of the men he had dispatched for supplies came in and reported: âFu
Shiren murdered the officer and persuade Mi Fang to surrender to Wu.â
The story filled Guan Yu with boundless rage. It was too much. The wound
reopened, and he fell in a swoon.
âWang Fu, you were right,â said he when he recovered consciousness. âHow
I regret that I did not heed what you said!â
âBut why were the beacon fires not lighted?â continued he presently.
Said the scouts, âLu Mengâs marines in the guise of traders came over the
river. There were soldiers hidden in the ships, and they seized the beacon
guards, so preventing them from kindling the fires.â
Guan Yu sighed. Beating the ground with his foot, he said, âIndeed I have
fallen into their trap. How shall I look my brother in the face?â
Then outspoke Commissariat Commander Zhao Lei, saying, âWe are in straits.
Send to Chengdu for help, and let us take the land road to Jingzhou to try to
recover it.â
So Guan Yu sent Ma Liang and Yi Ji to Shu to ask for help. The messengers rode
out swiftly by different routes, while the army set out to return to Jingzhou,
Guan Yu leading and Liao Hua with Guan Ping keeping the rear.
The siege of Fancheng being thus raised, Cao Ren went to see his master. With
tears he acknowledged his fault and asked pardon.
âIt was the will of heaven, and no fault of yours,â said Cao Cao.
And he rewarded the armies.
When he visited Sizhong and had inspected the captured stockades, he remarked
on the defenses, saying, âXu Huang was very clever to overcome these. With my
thirty years of war, I should not have dared to penetrate such opposition. He
is valiant and wise, and both in a high degree.â
âAye,â said they with him, for they could not but agree.
Cao Caoâs army marched back to Mopo and there camped. When Xu Huang returned,
Cao Cao went out of the stockade to meet him, and netted with joy when seeing
the excellent order and discipline that his army showed. Every soldier was in
his place, the ranks perfectly kept, all without a trace of disorder.
âGeneral Xu Huang has the spirit of the old Zhou Yafu,â said Cao Cao, and
on the spot conferred on his commander the title of General Who Pacifies the
South. Xu Huang was sent soon after to share in the defense of Xiangyang with
Xiahou Shang and to meet Guan Yuâs army.
Jingzhou being still in turmoil, Cao Cao remained at Mopo waiting for news.
Guan Yu found himself at a standstill on the road to Jingzhou with the army of
Wu in front and the men of Wei coming up behind.
âWhat is to be done,â he discussed the position with Zhao Lei, âwhen we
cannot advance nor retreat and the aid has not come?â
Zhao Lei proposed a halt to try to shame Lu Meng into aiding Cao Cao.
Said he, âWhen Lu Meng was at Lukou, he used to write to you often, and you
agreed to join hands in the destruction of Cao Cao. Now he is a traitor and
fighting on the other side. Send a letter and reproach him. Perhaps we may get
a satisfactory reply.â
So the letter was written and sent to Jingzhou.
Meanwhile, by Lu Mengâs special command, the most complete protection was
given to the families of all the officers who were serving under Guan Yu, and
they were kept supplied with all they required. Even the ailing members of
their households were treated by physicians free of charge. The result was that
they were quite won over to the new order of things, and there was no attempt
to disturb it. When Guan Yuâs letter came, the messenger was led into the
city and well treated.
When Lu Meng read the letter, he said to the bearer thereof, âYou must
understand the different circumstances. When your general and I were leagued
together, it was a personal matter between us two. Now things have changed. I
am sent here with certain orders and am not my own master. I would trouble you,
O messenger, to return and explain thus to your master and in good words.â
The bearer of the letter was entertained at a banquet and sent to repose
himself in the guest-house, where the families of the absent officers sought
him to have news of their husbands and fathers. Moreover, they brought him
letters and gave him messages for the officers, and the whole tenor of these
letters and messages was that they were all in good health, all their needs
were supplied, and they lacked nothing. When he left the city, Lu Meng himself
escorted him to the outskirts and set him on his way.
On his return to the army, he gave to Guan Yu the message of Lu Meng and told
him that the families were all well and safe and well cared for. This, however,
did not greatly please Guan Yu.
Stamping his foot, Guan Yu said, âThis is merely a ruse to gain favor and
popularity. The brigand! If I cannot slay him while I live, I will after I am
dead. My hate shall not go unappeased.â
He roughly dismissed the messenger, who went out and was at once surrounded by
those whose families were in the city and who desired to have news of them. And
when he gave them the letters and messages and told them all were well, there
was great rejoicing among the men in the camp, and kindly feelings for Lu Meng
prevailed. And therewith died down the spirit of fighting.
Guan Yu led the army to attack Jingzhou, but day by day the men deserted and
ran away to the very city they were moving to attack. So day by day Guan Yuâs
bitterness and anger increased, and he advanced in angry haste. One day there
was a great shouting and the noise of drums, and he found his way blocked.
âWhy do you not surrender, friend Guan Yu?â said the leader of this body,
Jiang Qin.
âCould I give in to a rebel â-I, a servant of the Hans and a leader of
their army?â roared Guan Yu in a passion.
Thereupon he whipped his horse forward and swung up his sword to strike.
However, Jiang Qin would not fight. The two exchanged a few blows, and Jiang
Qin fled. Guan Yu followed. When he had gone a long way, there suddenly
appeared from a gully near him Han Dang, while Zhou Tai came out from the other
side. Thereupon Jiang Qin wheeled round and once more came to do battle, so
that three forces were opposed to Guan Yu. Unable to withstand these, he
retreated.
Before he had gone very far, he saw signs of many people bivouacking among the
hills, and presently made out, on a huge white banner that flapped in the
breeze, the words Natives of Jingzhou, and the people about were calling out,
âAll the inhabitants of this place have surrendered.â
Guan Yu felt like rushing up and cutting these people to pieces, but just then
two other cohorts appeared led by Ding Feng and Xu Sheng, who supported Jiang
Qin. The three bodies of troops then set on with shouting and loud beating of
drums that seemed to make the very earth tremble. And Guan Yu was like the
kernel in a nut, quite surrounded.
This was not all. He saw the number of his followers diminishing every moment.
He fought on till dusk, and looking about him he saw all the hills crowded with
Jingzhou folks and heard them calling siblings for brother and children for
father, till his soldiersâ hearts had melted within them. One by one they ran
to their relatives, heedless of their leader and his voice. Presently he had
but three hundred left, but with them he kept up the battle till the third
watch. Then there was another shouting in another note, for his leaders, Guan
Ping, his son, and Liao Hua, came to his help. And they rescued him.
âThe soldiersâ hearts are all melted,â said Guan Ping. âWe must find
some place wherein to camp till help can arrive. There is Maicheng, small, but
sufficient. Let us camp there.â
Guan Yu consented, and the exhausted army hurried thither as quickly as they
could. The small force was divided among the four gates to guard.
Zhao Lei said, âThis place is near Shangyong where Meng Da and Liu Feng
station. We should send for their help. If their army marches to our relief
until the grand army of Shu comes, the morale of our army will improve.â
But disappointments dogged them. Very soon the army of Wu came up and laid
siege to the city.
âWho will try to break through and go away to Shangyong for assistance?â
asked Guan Yu.
âI will go,â said Liao Hua.
âAnd I will escort you past the danger zone,â said Guan Ping.
Guan Yu wrote his letter, which Liao Hua concealed next to his skin, and having
eaten a full meal, he rode out at the gate. The leader of the enemy, Ding Feng,
tried to check him, but Guan Ping fought vigorously and drove him away. So Liao
Hua escaped the siege and reached Shangyong, while Guan Ping returned. Then
they barred the gates and hold their defense.
Now, having captured Shangyong, Liu Feng and Meng Da had remained to guard it.
Liu Feng had been created Governor General, and together with Meng Da, to
defend that city. When they heard of the defeat of Guan Yu, they took counsel
what to do. When Liao Hua came, he was admitted into the city. He told the tale
of Guan Yuâs straits, and asked for help.
Said Liao Hua, âGuan Yu is closely besieged in Maicheng. Help from the west
will be a long time in coming, so I have been sent to beg your assistance. I
hope you will march the Shangyong troops thither as quickly as possible, for
any delay will be fatal.â
Liu Feng replied, âSir, go to the rest-house for a time till we can
decide.â
So Liao Hua went, and the two leaders talked over the matter.
Liu Feng said, âThis is bad news. What is to be done?â
âWu is very powerful,â replied his colleague. âNow they have control over
the whole region of Jingzhou, save this small clod of earth called Maicheng.
Cao Cao is at hand with five hundred thousand troops, and we cannot stand
against the two mighty forces. I say we must not move.â
âI know all this. But Guan Yu is my uncle, and I cannot bear to sit still and
not try to save him.â
âSo you hold him as an uncle!â said Meng Da with a smile. âYet I do not
think he holds you much as a nephew. When the Prince of Hanzhong adopted you,
Guan Yu was greatly annoyed. And after the Prince had accepted his new dignity
and was nominating his heir, I heard he consulted Zhuge Liang, who said the
affair was one to be decided within the family and declined to advise. Then the
Prince sent to ask Guan Yuâs advice. Did Guan Yu name you? Not at all. You
were only a son by adoption and could have no place in the succession. Further,
Guan Yu advised that you be sent to a distance lest you might cause trouble.
This is common knowledge, and I am surprised that you are ignorant of it. Yet
today you make capital out of the relationship and are willing to run a great
risk to support it.â
âGranted that what you say is true, still what reply can we give?â
âSimply say that this city is still unsettled, and you dare not move lest it
be lost.â
Liu Feng took his colleagueâs view, sent for the messenger and told him. Liao
Hua was greatly disappointed. He threw himself on the ground and knocked his
head, imploring assistance.
âIf you act thus, there is an end of Guan Yu!â cried Liao Hua.
âWill a cup of water extinguish a wagon load of blazing wood?â said Meng
Da. âHasten back and await patiently for the coming of help from the west.â
Liao Hua renewed his entreaties. The two commanders simply rose, shook out
their sleeves, and left him. Liao Hua saw that things had gone against him and
thought his best course would be to go at once to Chengdu. He rode out of the
city cursing its defenders and went away west.
Guan Yu from his fortress looked anxiously, but vainly, for the coming of the
expected aid. He was in a sorry plight. His army numbered but a few hundred,
many wounded; there was no food.
Then someone came to the foot of the wall and, calling out to the defenders on
the wall not to shoot, said he had a message for the commander. He was allowed
to enter. It was Zhuge Jin. When he had made his salutations and taken tea, he
began his harangue.
âI come at the command of my master, the Marquis of Wu, to persuade you to a
wise course. From of old it has always been recognized that the hero must bow
to circumstances. The region with its nine territories and forty-two counties
that you ruled have come under another, with the exception of this single city.
Within, there is no food, without, no help, so that it must fall quickly.
Wherefore, O General, why not hear me and join your fortunes to those of Wu?
You shall be restored to your governorship, and you will preserve your family.
If haply, Sir, you would reflect thereon.â
Guan Yu replied, quite calmly, âI am a simple soldier from the village of
Jieliang, yet my lord and I have become brothers. How can I betray him? If the
city may fall, then I can but die. Jade may be shattered, but its whiteness
remains; bamboo may be burned, but its joints stand straight. My body may be
broken, but my name shall live true in history. Say no more, but leave the
city, I beg. I will fight Sun Quan to the end.â
âMy master desires to enter into such a league with you as did Qin and Jin in
former days, that you may mutually assist to destroy Cao Cao and restore the
Hans. That is his idea, and why do you persist in this wrong course?â
As Zhuge Jin finished this speech, Guan Ping, who was by, drew his sword to
slay him. But his father checked him.
âRemember his brother is in Shu, helping your uncle. If you hurt him, you
will injure the principle of fraternity.â
Guan Yu then bade his servants lead Zhuge Jin away. Zhuge Jin went, his face
covered with shame, and left the city. When he reached his master, he told of
Guan Yuâs obduracy and rejection of all argument.
âHe is indeed a loyal servant!â said Sun Quan. âStill, what is to be done
next?â
âTake some casts in the Book of Changes,â said Lu Fan.
So the lots were taken and explained to mean that the Marquisâ enemies should
flee to a distance.
Then Sun Quan asked Lu Meng, saying, âIf he flies to a distance, how can he
be captured?â
âThe divination exactly fits in with my schemes,â replied Lu Meng. âEven
if Guan Yu had wings to soar to the skies, he would not escape my net.â
The dragon in a puddle is the sport of shrimps,
The phoenix in a cage is mocked of small birds.
The scheme of Lu Meng will be unfolded in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 77 ****
very few soldiers left, and he will not venture along the high road. North of
Maicheng is a risky path, and he will try to escape along that. Therefore you
must lay an ambush for him seven miles away from the city, but do not stop him.
Let him go by, and then harass his rear. Thus he will be forced into Linju. Set
another small ambush near there, and you will capture your enemy. For the
present, attack the city vigorously on all sides but one, leaving the north
gate for escape.â
Before carrying out this plan, Sun Quan bade Lu Fan consult the auspices.
Lu Fan did so, announcing, âThe enemy will flee toward the northwest, but
will be caught that night before midnight.â
So Zhu Ran was sent in command of the first ambush, and Pan Zhang was the
second. The troops sent were all veterans.
When Guan Yu mustered his fighting men in the city of Maicheng, he had but
three hundred. The food was done. That night many soldiers of Wu came to the
city walls and called to their friends by name, and many of these slipped over
the wall and deserted, reducing the small force still further. No rescue force
appeared, and Guan Yu was at the end of his resources.
Again he bewailed to Wang Fu, saying, âI regret that I have neglected your
wise warning. In this danger what is to be done?â
âI think even if Lu Wang could come to life again, he would be helpless in
this case,â replied Wang Fu, weeping.
Said Zhao Lei, âLiu Feng and Meng Da have surely decided not to send help
from Shangyong. Let us abandon this miserable place, try to get to Yizhou, and
recover the army. We may then tempt our fortune once more.â
âI agree with you that that is the best plan,â said Guan Yu.
Then he ascended the walls and surveyed the country. Noting that the weakest
side was the north, he called in some of the inhabitants and inquired the
nature of the country on that side.
They replied, âThere are only paths there, but by them one may get into the
West River Land.â
âWe will go that way tonight,â said Guan Yu.
Wang Fu opposed it, saying, âGeneral, you will surely fall into an ambush.
The main road will be safer.â
âThere may be an ambush, but do I fear that?â said the old warrior.
Orders were given to be ready to march.
âAt least be very cautious,â said Wang Fu. âI will defend this city to
the very last. I only need a hundred troops. Never will we surrender. Only I
hope, Most Noble General, that you will send me speedy help.â
The two parted in tears. Wang Fu and Zhou Cang remaining to guard Maicheng.
Guan Yu, Guan Ping, and Zhao Lei marched with their weak force out of the north
gate. Guan Yu, his green-dragon saber ready to hand, went first. About the
third watch, seven miles lay between them and the city. There they saw a deep
cleft in the hills wherefrom rolled the sound of beaten drums. And men were
shouting. Soon appeared a large force with Zhu Ran at their head.
He came dashing forward, and summoned the small party, saying, âGuan Yu, do
not run! Surrender and live!â
But Guan Yu whipped his steed to a gallop and bore down on the leader with
anger in his eyes. Then Zhu Ran ran away. Guan Yu followed him till there came
the loud boom of a large drum, and out sprang troops from all sides. Guan Yu
dared not engage such a number, and fled in the direction of Linju. Zhu Ran
came up behind and attacked the flying soldiers, so that Guan Yuâs following
gradually became smaller and smaller.
Still he struggled on. A few miles farther the drums rolled again, and torches
lit up all round. This was Pan Zhangâs ambush, and he appeared flourishing
his sword. Guan Yu whirled his blade and went to meet him, but Pan Zhang ran
away after a couple of bouts. However, Guan Yu saw they were too many for him,
and sought refuge among the mountains.
His son followed, and when he got within speaking distance, Guan Ping gave him
the mournful tidings: âZhao Lei has fallen in the melee!â
Guan Yu was very sad, and bade his son try to protect the rear while he should
force his way forward.
With about ten men he reached Zhuxi, a place with mountains on both sides. At
their foot was a thick mass of reeds and dried grass. The trees grew very
close. It was then the fifth watch. Presently the small party stumbled into
another ambush, and the ambushing soldiers thrust forth hooks and threw ropes.
Entangled in these, Guan Yuâs horse fell, and Guan Yu reeled out of the
saddle. In a moment Ma Zhong, the Marching General of Pan Zhang, made him a
prisoner. Guan Ping dashed to his rescue, but before he could do anything, he
also was surrounded and held. Father and son were both captives.
With great joy Sun Quan heard of the success of his plans. In the morning, he
assembled all his officers in his tent to await the arrival of the prisoners.
Before long, Ma Zhong came hustling his prisoner before his lord.
âI have long had a friendly feeling for you,â said Sun Quan to Guan Yu,
âon account of your great virtues. Now I would have made a covenant and
alliance with you, if you would. You and your son have long held yourselves to
be invincible, but you see you are my prisoners today. Yet I hope to win you
over to my side.â
But Guan Yu only answered roughly, âYou green-eyed boy! You purple-bearded
rat! I made a covenant in the Peach Garden with my brothers to uphold the Hans.
Think you that I will stand side by side with a rebel such as you are? I am a
victim of your vile schemes, but I can only die once. And there is no need of
many words.â
âHe is a real hero, and I love him,â said Sun Quan to those standing near.
âI will treat him well and endeavor to win him over. Do you think it well?â
Said the First Secretary Zuo Xian, âWhen Cao Cao had hold of this man, Cao
Cao treated him lavishly well. Cao Cao created him a marquis; in three-day
interval Cao Cao held a small banquet, in five days a great one; Cao Cao gave
him gold and presented him with silver; all this, hoping to retain him at his
side. But Cao Cao failed. The man broke through his gates, slew his six
generals in five passes and went away. Today Cao Cao fears him, and almost
moved the capital for dread of him. Now he is in your power, destroy him, or
you will rue the day. Evil will come if you spare him.â
Sun Quan reflected for some time.
âYou are right,â said he presently, and gave the order for execution.
So father and son met their fate together in the winter of the twenty-fourth
year (AD 219) in the tenth month. Guan Yu was fifty-eight.
A poem says:
Peerless indeed was our Lord Guan Yu, of the latter days,
Head and shoulders stood he out among the best;
Godlike and terrible in war, elegant and refined in peace,
Resplendent as the noonday sun in the heavens,
Haloed as are the noblest of those early days,
He stands, the brightest model for all ages,
And not only for the strenuous days he lived in.
And another:
Seek ye a noble one? Then take ye the way of Jieliang,
Watch ye how all people revere Guan Yu,
Each excelling others to honor him,
Him, one of the three brothers of the Peach Garden Oath,
Who have won sacrifices, as emperor and king.
Incomparable their aura spreads through the world;
They are resplendent as the great lights of the firmament;
Temples to our Lord Guan Yu abound, no village lacks one,
Their venerable trees at sundown are the resting places for birds.
So Guan Yu ended his life. His famous steed, Red Hare, also captured with its
master, was sent to Sun Quan, who gave it as a reward to his captor, Ma Zhong.
But Red Hare survived its master only a short time. It refused to feed, and
soon died.
Foreboding of misfortune came to Wang Fu within the city of Maicheng. His bones
felt cold, and his flesh crept.
He said to his colleague Zhou Cang, âI have had a terrible dream in which I
saw our lord all dripping with gore. I would question him, but I was overcome
with dread. May it augur no evil tidings!â
Just then the troops of Wu came up to the city wall and displayed the gory
heads of the two, father and son. Wang Fu and Zhou Cang went up on the wall to
see if the dread tokens were real. There was no doubt. Wang Fu with a
despairing cry threw himself over the wall and perished, Zhou Cang died by his
own hand. Thus Maicheng fell to Wu.
The execution of Guan Yu gave Sun Quan undisputed possession of the whole of
the Jingzhou Region. He rewarded his soldiers and spread a great feast at which
Lu Meng was in the seat of honor.
Sun Quan made a speech, saying, âAfter long waiting, the desire of my heart
has come to me very easily through the magnificent efforts of my friend Lu
Meng.â
Lu Meng bowed and bowed deprecatingly, but Sun Quan continued, âMy good Zhou
Yu was superior to most humans, and he defeated Cao Cao at the Red Cliffs.
Alas! He died too soon. My good Lu Su succeeded him. In his first interview, he
inaugurated the general policy of creating a state. That was the first instance
of his keen insight. When Cao Cao descended upon my country, and everyone
counseled me to yield, he advised me to summon my good Zhou Yu to oppose and
smite Cao Cao. That was the second instance of his keen insight. He made only
one fault: He advised me to let Liu Bei occupy Jingzhou. Now today my good Lu
Meng has succeeded, and in that he far surpasses both his predecessors.â
Then Sun Quan filled a goblet and in person presented it to the guest of the
evening. Lu Meng took the cup, but as he raised it, a sudden change came over
him.
Dashing the cup to the ground, Lu Meng seized Sun Quan, crying, âO green-eyed
boy! O purple-bearded rat! Do you know me?â
Consternation seized the whole assembly, but many rushed to the rescue of their
lord, who had been thrown to the floor by the guest he had so lately
complimented. Rushing forward over Sun Quanâs body, Lu Meng sat himself in
the hostâs seat, his eyebrows staring stiff and his eyes glaring.
âAfter I quelled the Yellow Scarves, I went hither and thither for thirty
years. Now I have fallen victim to your base plots, and you have overcome me.
Living, I have been unable to gorge upon the flesh of my enemy; dead, I will
pursue the spirit of this bandit Lu Meng. I am the Lord of Hanshou, Guan Yu!â
Terror-stricken, Sun Quan was the first to fall prostrate, and all his officers
followed him.
Thereupon Lu Meng fell over dead, with blood gushing from the seven orifices of
his body.
In due time the body was coffined and interred. Lu Meng was created
posthumously Governor of Nanjun and Lord of Chanling. His son, Lu Ba, was given
hereditary nobility.
After this visitation Sun Quan lived in constant terror. Soon Zhang Zhao came
in from Jianye to see him and blame him for the murder.
âMy lord, by the slaughter of Guan Yu you have brought misfortune very near
to this state. You know the oath sworn in the Peach Garden. Now Liu Bei has the
force of the two River Lands at his back, Zhuge Liang as adviser, and those
heroes Zhang Fei, Zhao Zilong, Huang Zhong, and Ma Chao to carry out his
behests. When Liu Bei hears of the death of both father and son, he will set in
motion the whole force he has to avenge them, and I fear you cannot stand such
an onslaught.â
Sun Quan started up in a fright.
âYes, I have made a little mistake,â said he. âBut seeing it is so, what
shall I do?â
âYou need have no fear,â replied Zhang Zhao. âI have a plan to fend off
the armies of the west from our borders and keep Jingzhou quite safe.â
âWhat is your plan?â asked Sun Quan.
âCao Cao with his many legions is greedily aiming at the whole empire. If Liu
Bei wants revenge, he will ally himself with Cao Cao, and, should they combine
against the South Land, we should be in great danger. Therefore I advise you to
send Guan Yuâs head to Cao Cao to make it appear that Cao Cao was the prime
cause of his destruction. This should divert Liu Beiâs extreme hatred toward
Cao Cao and send the armies of Shu against Wei instead of toward Wu. After
carefully considering the whole matter, I counsel this as the best course of
action.â
Sun Quan thought the move worth making, and so the head of the great warrior
was placed in a box and sent off as quickly as possible to Cao Cao.
At this time Cao Caoâs army had marched back from Mopo to Luoyang. When he
heard of the coming of the gruesome gift, he was glad at heart.
Said he, âSo Guan Yu is dead. Now I can stick to my mat and sleep soundly at
night.â
But Sima Yi saw through the ruse and said from his place by the steps, âThis
is a trick to divert evil from Wu.â
âWhat do you mean? How?â said Cao Cao.
âThe Peach Garden Oath bound the three brothers to live and die together. Now
Wu is fearful of revenge for the execution of one of the three and sends the
head to you to cause Liu Beiâs wrath to fasten on you, O Prince. Sun Quan
wishes Liu Bei to attack you instead of himself, the real perpetrator of the
crime. Then he will find a way of accomplishing his ends while you two are
quarreling.â
âYou are right, friend,â said Cao Cao. âAnd now how can we escape?â
âI think escape is easy. You have the head of Guan Yu. Make a wooden image of
the remainder of the body, and bury the whole with the rites suitable to a
minister of state. When Liu Bei hears of this, he will turn his hate toward Sun
Quan and raise all his forces to attack him. If you will think it out, you will
see that whichever is victor the other will be smitten; and if we get one of
the two, the other will follow before very long.â
Cao Cao was pleased with the solution. Then he ordered the messenger to come in
with the box, which was opened, and he looked upon the face of the dead. The
features had not changed; the face bore the same appearance as of old. Cao Cao
smiled.
âI hope you have been well since our last meeting, Guan Yu,â said Cao Cao.
To his horror, the mouth opened, the eyes rolled, and the long beard and hair
stiffened. Cao Cao fell to the ground in a swoon.
They rushed to him, but it was a long time before he recovered consciousness.
âGeneral Guan Yu is indeed a spirit,â he said.
The messenger who had brought the dead warriorâs head told the story of Guan
Yu cursing and reviling Sun Quan, and of what had befallen Lu Meng.
Cao Cao, filled with dread, prepared sacrifices and performed the rites for the
honored dead. An effigy was carved out of heavy fragrant wood and buried
outside the south gate with all the rites of a princely noble, a huge concourse
of officials of all grades following in the procession. At the funeral Cao Cao
himself bowed before the coffin and poured a libation. He also conferred on the
dead the posthumous title of Prince of Jingzhou, and appointed guardians of the
tomb. The messenger was sent back to Wu.
Now the spirit of Guan Yu did not dissipate into space, but wandered through
the void till it came to a certain spot in Dangyang on a famous hill known as
the Mount of the Jade Spring. There lived a venerable Buddhist priest whose
name in the faith was Transverse Peace. He was originally of the State Guardian
Temple in the River Si Pass and abbot of that temple. In the course of roaming
about the world, he had reached this place. Entranced with its natural beauty,
he had built himself a shelter of boughs and grass, where he sat in meditation
on the âWayâ. He had a novice with him to beg food and to attend to his
simple wants.
This night, about the third watch, the moon was bright and the air serene.
Transverse Peace sat in his usual attitude in the silence of the mountains.
Suddenly he heard a great voice calling in the upper air, âGive back my head!
Give back my head!â
Gazing upward Transverse Peace saw the shape of a man mounted on a red horse.
In the hand was a shining blade like unto the green-dragon saber. Two military
figures were with him, one on either side. He on the left had a white face; he
on the right was swarthy of countenance with a curly beard. And they followed
the figure with the shining blade. They floated along on a cloud which came to
rest on the summit of the mountain.
The recluse recognized the figure as that of Guan Yu, so with his yakâs tail
flagellum he smote the lintel of his hut and cried, âWhere is Guan Yu?â
The spirit understood, and the figure dismounted, glided down, and came to rest
at the door of the hut.
Interlacing its fingers, it stood in a reverential attitude and said, âWho is
my teacher, and what is his name in the faith?â
âIn the State Guardian Temple in River Si Pass, I once saw you, O Noble Sir,
and I was not likely to forget your face,â replied the priest.
âI am deeply grateful for the help you gave me. Misfortune has befallen me,
and I have ceased to live. I would seek the pure instruction and beg you to
indicate the obscure way.â
âLet us not discuss former wrongdoings nor present correct actions. Later
events are the inevitable result of former causes. I know that Lu Meng has
injured you. You call aloud for the return of your head. But who will also
return the heads of your several victims â-Yan Liang, Wen Chou, and the
commanders of the five passes?â
Thereupon Guan Yu seemed suddenly to comprehend, bowed in token of assent, and
disappeared. After this appearance to the recluse, his spirit wandered hither
and thither about the mountain, manifesting its sacred character and guarding
the people.
Impressed by his virtue, the inhabitants built a temple on the Mount of the
Jade Spring, wherein they sacrificed at the four seasons. In later days, one
wrote a couplet for the temple, the first member reading:
âRuddy faced, reflecting the honest heart within, out-riding the wind on the
Red Hare steed, mindful of the Red Emperor;â
âIn the light of clear lamp, reading the histories, resting on the Green-
Dragon saber curved as the young moon, heart pure as the azure heaven.â
Meanwhile in Shu, having conquered East River Land, the Prince of Hanzhong
returned to his capital Chengdu.
Fa Zheng memorialized, saying, âO Prince, thy consorts has passed away, and
the Lady Sun has returned to her maiden home, perhaps never to come again.
Human relations should not be set at nought, wherefore another consort should
be sought, so that all things may be correctly ordered within the Palace.â
The Prince having signified his acceptance of the principle, Fa Zheng
continued, âThere is the sister of Wu Yi, comely and good, and declared by
the physiognomist as destined to high honor. She was betrothed to Liu Mao, son
of Liu Yan, but he died in youth, and she has remained unwedded. Take her as a
wife.â
âIt is incompatible with propriety. Liu Mao and I are of the same
ancestry.â
âAs to the degree of relationship, would it differ from the marriage between
Duke Wen of Jin and Lady Huai Ying?â
Upon this precedent the Prince gave his consent and wedded the lady, and she
bore to him two sons, the elder of whom was named Liu Yung and the younger Liu
Li.
Meanwhile, the whole land of Shu was prospering, the people were tranquil, and
the state was becoming wealthy. The fields in both River Lands yielded
bountiful harvests.
Suddenly there came one who told of the attempt of Sun Quan to ally himself
with Guan Yu by marriage, and the indignant rejection of the proposal.
âJingzhou is in danger,â said Zhuge Liang. âRecall and replace Guan
Yu.â
Then began to arrive a series of messengers from Jingzhou, bearers of news of
the moves in the game. At first they brought good tidings, then evil. Guan Xing
came first to tell of the drowning of the seven armies of Yu Jin. Then one
reported the installation of beacon towers along the river bank, and other
preparations which seemed as near perfect as any could be. And Liu Beiâs
anxiety ceased.
But evil tidings were on the way. Liu Bei was ill at ease and felt a creepiness
of the skin that boded evil. He was restless by day and sleepless by night. One
night he rose from his couch and was reading by the light of a candle when
drowsiness overcame him, and he fell asleep over the low table by his side. He
dreamed. A cold gust of wind swept through the chamber, almost putting out the
candle flame. When it brightened again he glanced up and saw a figure standing
near the light.
âWho are you, who thus come by night to my chamber?â asked he.
The figure made no reply, and Liu Bei got up to go over and see who it was.
Then the figure took the shape of his brother. But it avoided him, retreating
as he advanced.
Liu Bei said, âBrother, there is nothing wrong, I hope. But surely something
of great importance brings you here thus in the dead of the night. And why do
you avoid me, your brother, who loves you as himself?â
Then the figure wept and said, âBrother, send your armies to avenge me.â
As Guan Yu said that, a chilly blast went through the room, and the figure
disappeared. Just then Liu Bei awoke and knew that he had dreamed.
The drums were beating the third watch as he awoke. He felt greatly worried and
disturbed. So he went into the front portion of the Palace and sent for Zhuge
Liang. Soon he came, and Liu Bei told him of the vision.
âYou have been thinking too deeply of Guan Yu lately, my lord,â said Zhuge
Liang. âThere is no need to be distressed.â
But Liu Bei could not find comfort, and Zhuge Liang was long in calming his
feelings and arguing away his fancies.
As Zhuge Liang left the building, he met Xu Jing, who said, âInstructor, I
went to your residence to deliver a very secret piece of news, and they told me
to find you here.â
âWhat is your secret?â
âThere is a report about that Wu has got possession of Jingzhou; Lu Meng has
taken it. And more than that, Guan Yu is dead. I had to come to tell you.â
âI saw it in the sky some nights ago. A large star of a general fell over
against Jingzhou, and I knew some evil had befallen Guan Yu. But I feared the
effect upon our master, and I forbore to say anything.â
They did not know that Liu Bei was standing just within the door.
Suddenly Liu Bei rushed out, seized Zhuge Liang by the sleeve and said, âWhy
did you hide from me? Why, when you had such terrible news?â
âBecause it is only a rumor,â replied they. âIt is too improbable for
belief. We pray you not to be distressed.â
âBy our oath we live or die together: How can I go on living if he is
lost?â
The two men soothed their lord as best they could. But even as they spoke to
him, one of the private attendants said that Ma Liang and Yi Ji had arrived.
Liu Bei called them in and questioned them eagerly.
They said, âJingzhou has indeed been lost, and Guan Yu begs for instant
help.â
The letters they brought had not been read before Liao Hua was ushered in. He
prostrated himself and, weeping, told the story of the refusal of help on the
part of Liu Feng and Meng Da.
âThen is my brother lost!â cried Liu Bei.
âIf those two have really behaved so badly, the offense is even too great for
death,â said Zhuge Liang. âBut calm yourself, O Prince. I will see about an
army and lead it to the rescue.â
âIf Guan Yu is gone, I cannot live,â moaned Liu Bei. âTomorrow I myself
will set out with an army to rescue him.â
Liu Bei sent off a messenger to Zhang Fei in Langzhong and gave orders to
muster horse and foot for instant departure.
Before day dawned other messengers arrived, giving step by step the sequence of
the tragedy: âGuan Yu had cut his way to Linju at night and been captured by
a general of Wu. He had refused to bend, and both father and son had gone to
the Nine Springs.â
When he heard of the final catastrophe, Liu Bei uttered a great cry and fell
swooning.
His mind went back to the pledge of days gone by;
Could he live still and let his brother die?
What happened will be told in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 78 ****
As has been said, the Prince of Hanzhong swooned on hearing the terrible news
of the death of the two Guans, father and son. His officers went to his help,
and when he had recovered sufficiently, they led him to his private apartments.
âMy lord, control your grief,â said Zhuge Liang. âLife and death are
fixed by fate. Guan Yu brought the evil upon himself by his harshness and
haughtiness. You must now take care of your health and mature your
vengeance.â
âWhen we swore brotherhood in the Peach Garden, we pledged ourselves to live
or die together. What enjoyment of riches and honors is there for me now that
my brother is gone?â
Just then he saw Guan Yuâs son, Guan Xing, coming in weeping in deep
distress. At sight of the youth, Liu Bei uttered a great cry and again sank to
the earth. By and by he came to, and spent the whole day weeping and swooning
at intervals. For three days he refused all nourishment, and he wept so
bitterly that his garments were wetted, and there were spots of blood. Zhuge
Liang and the others tried every means to soothe him, but he was inconsolable.
âI swear I will not live under the same heaven as Sun Quan,â cried he.
âIt is said that the head of your brother has been sent to Cao Cao, but Cao
Cao has buried the remains with the rites of a princely noble,â said Zhuge
Liang.
âWhy did he do that?â asked Liu Bei.
âBecause Sun Quan thought thereby to bring evil upon Cao Cao. But Cao Cao saw
through the subterfuge and has buried your brother with great honor so that
your anger may burn against Wu.â
âI want to send my armies to punish Wu and appease my wrath,â said Liu Bei.
âNo, you may not do that. Wu wishes to move you to smite Wei, and Wei wishes
you to attack Wu, each harboring the malevolent design of taking advantage of
the quarrel. You would do well, my lord, to keep your armies at home. Put on
mourning for Guan Yu, and wait till Wei and Wu are at war. That will be your
time.â
The other officers supported Zhuge Liang, and Liu Bei listened. Presently his
grief spent itself, and he began to take food again. An edict was promulgated
enjoining mourning dress upon all officials. The Prince went outside the south
gate to summon the spirit home, and sacrificed and wailed a whole day for the
dead warrior, his brother.
In Luoyang, although Cao Cao had given honorable burial to the remains of Guan
Yu, yet he was continually haunted by the dead manâs spirit. Every night when
he closed his eyes, he saw Guan Yu as he knew the warrior so well in the flesh.
These visions made him nervous, and he sought the advice of his officers. Some
suggested the building of new rooms for his own use.
âThere is much witchcraft and malign influence in this old Palace at Luoyang.
Build a new Palace for your own occupation,â said they.
âI would, and it should be called âThe New Foundationâ,â said he.
âBut where is the good architect?â
Jia Xu said, âThere is one Su Yue, a very cunning artificer in Luoyang.â
Su Yue was called and set to work on the plans for a nine-hall pavilion for Cao
Caoâs own use. It had verandahs and upper rooms as well. His plans pleased
Cao Cao greatly.
âYou have planned just such a place as I wished, only where will you find the
main beam for such a building?â
âI know a certain tree that will serve,â said the architect. âAbout ten
miles from the city there is the Pool of the Leaping Dragon. Near it is a
shrine, and beside that grows a fine pear tree. It is over a hundred spans
high, and that will serve for the roof tree.â
Cao Cao at once sent people to fell the tree. But after one whole day of labor
they came back to say they could make no impression on it neither with saw nor
ax. Cao Cao, doubting their word, went to see. When he had dismounted and stood
by the tree, he could not but admire its size and proportions, as it rose above
him tall, straight and branched till the wide-spreading and symmetrical top
reached into the clouds. But he bade the men attack it again.
Then a few aged people of the village came and said, âThe tree has stood here
some centuries and is the haunt of a spirit. We think it should not be cut
down.â
Cao Cao grew annoyed, saying, âI have gone to and fro in the world now some
thirty years, and there is no one, from the Emperor to the commoner, who does
not fear me. What spirit is there who dares oppose my wish?â
Drawing the sword he was wearing, Cao Cao went up to the tree and slashed at
the trunk. The tree groaned as he struck, and blood stains spattered his dress.
Terror-stricken, he threw down the sword, mounted his horse and galloped off.
But that evening when he retired to rest, he could not sleep. He rose, went
into the outer room, and sat there leaning on a low table. Suddenly a man
appeared with his hair unbound, dressed in black and carrying a naked sword.
The visitor came straight toward Cao Cao, stopped in front of him and,
pointing, cried out, âBehold the Spirit of the Pear Tree! You may desire to
build your nine-hall pavilion, and you may contemplate rebellion. But when you
began to attack my sacred tree, the number of your days was accomplished. I am
come now to slay you.â
âWhere are the guards?â shouted Cao Cao in terror.
The figure struck at him with the sword. Cao Cao cried out and then awoke. His
head was aching unbearably.
They sought the best physicians for him, but they failed to relieve the
terrible pain. Sympathy for their lord was universal among Cao Caoâs
subordinates.
Hua Xin one day said to his master, âMy lord, have you heard of Hua Tuo?â
âDo you mean him of Qiao who cured Zhou Tai?â
âYes, that is he,â replied Hua Xin.
âI have heard something of his fame, but I know nothing of his capabilities
in his art.â
âHe is very clever; there are few so skillful. If one is ill and calls him
in, he knows immediately whether to use drugs, or the needle, or the cutlery,
and the patient finds relief at once. Let one suffer from an internal complaint
and drugs are ineffectual, with a dose of hashish he throws the patient into a
state of perfect insensibility and then opens the abdomen and washes the
affected organs with a medicament. The patient feels no pain. When the
cleansing is complete, he sews up the wound with thread, dresses it, and in a
month or less the patient is well. This shows you how skillful he is.
âOne day Hua Tuo was traveling, when he heard a man by the wayside groaning
with pain. âThat is dyspepsia,â said Hua Tuo. And further questions
confirmed the diagnosis. He prescribed long draughts of the juice of garlic as
an emetic, and the man vomited a worm. After this the man was quite well.
âChen Deng, the Governor of Guangling, suffered from a heavy feeling at the
heart. His face was red and congested, and he had no appetite. Hua Tuo gave him
a drug, and he threw up many internal wriggling parasites with red heads. The
Governor asked what had caused the trouble, and Hua Tuo told him that he ate
too much strong smelling fish. He could cure Chen Deng this once, but in three
years the disease would recur, and then nothing could save him. Three later
Chen Deng died.
âAnother man had a tumor between the eyes, and it itched intolerably. Hua Tuo
examined it and said there was a bird in it. The tumor was opened, and, surely
enough, a canary flew out. The patient was relieved.
âA dog bit a manâs toe, and two tumorous growths ensued, one of which
itched intolerably and the other pained severely. Hua Tuo said the painful one
contained ten needles, and the other a couple of chess pips, black and white.
He opened the two swellings, and the contents were as he had said. Really he is
of the same class of physician as masters Bian Que and Zang Kong of old times.
He lives at Jincheng, not far away, and could be here very soon.â
Cao Cao summoned him. As soon as he arrived, Hua Tuo felt the pulse and made
careful examination.
âPrince, your headaches are due to a malignant humor within the brain case.
The humor is too thick to get out. Swallowing drugs will do no good. But I
propose to administer a dose of hashish, then open the brain case and remove
the thickened humor. That will be a radical cure.â
âYou mean you want to kill me?â cried Cao Cao angrily.
âO Prince, you have heard how I cured Guan Yu of the poison that had got into
his bones? I scraped them, and he did not hesitate a moment. Your malady is
trifling, and why do you mistrust me?â
âA painful arm may be scraped, but how can you cut open a manâs head? The
fact is you have conspired with some of Guan Yuâs friends to take this
opportunity to make away with me in revenge for his death.â
Cao Cao told his lictors to hale Hua Tuo to gaol, and there he was tortured to
try to find who were his accomplices.
Jia Xu pleaded for him, saying, âThe man possesses rare skills. To kill him
is to waste his talents.â
But the intervention was of no avail.
âThe man wants to get a chance to kill me. He is the same sort of scoundrel
as Ji Ping.â
The wretched physician was subjected to worse sufferings.
His gaoler was a certain Wu, nicknamed âThe Gaolerâ by nearly everybody. He
was kindly disposed to Hua Tuo and saw that Hua Tuo was well fed.
Hua Tuo conceived a liking for his gaoler and said to him one day, âI am
doomed, I know. The pity is that my Black Bag treatise on medicine may be lost.
You have been most kind to me, and as I have no other way of recompensing you,
I will give you a letter to my wife telling her to send the Black Bag, and I
will give it to you that you may carry on my art.â
Wu the Gaoler rejoiced greatly, saying, ï¿½If I have that book, I will throw
away the menial position of gaoler, travel about the country healing sick
folks, and spread your virtue.ï¿½
The letter was written and given to Wu the Gaoler, who lost no time in
traveling to Jincheng to meet with Hua Tuoâs wife, and she gave him the Black
Bag to bring back to Hua Tuo. After Hua Tuo had read through the book
carefully, he presented it to Wu the Gaoler, who took it home and hid it away.
Ten days after this, Hua Tuo died in prison. Wu the Gaoler bought a coffin and
had him buried. This done, he quitted the prison and went home. But when he
asked for the book, he found that his wife had discovered it and was using it
to light the fire. He snatched away what was left of it, but a whole volume was
missing, and what was left amounted only to several pages. He vented his anger
in cursing his wife.
But she retorted, saying, âIf you become such a learned person as Hua Tuo,
you will only die in prison like him. What good did it all do him?â
It struck Wu the Gaoler that there was something in what she said, and he
ceased grumbling at her. But the upshot of all this was that the learning in
the âTreatise of the Black Bagâ was finally lost to the world, for what was
left only contained the recipes relating to domestic animals.
Hua Tuo was the ablest of physician,
Seeing what diseases were lurking within beings.
Alas! That he died, and his writings
Followed him to the Nine Golden Springs.
Meanwhile, Cao Cao became worse, the uncertainty of the intentions of his
rivals aggravating his disease not a little. Then they said an envoy had come
with letter from Wu, and it ran like this:
âThy servant, Sun Quan, has long seen destiny indicates Your Highness as
master of all, and looks forward with confidence to your early accession to the
dignity of the Son of God. If you will send your armies to destroy Liu Bei and
sweep rebellion from the two River Lands, thy servant at the head of his armies
will submit and accept his land as a fief.â
Cao Cao laughed as he read this, and he said to his officers, âIs this youth
trying to put me on a furnace?â
But Minister Chen Qun and the attendants seriously replied, âO Prince, the
Hans have been feeble too long, while your virtues and merits are like the
mountains. All the people look to you, and when Sun Quan acknowledged himself
as your minister, he is but responsive to the will of God and the desire of
humans. It is wrong that you oppose when such contrary influences work to a
common end, and you must soon ascend to the high place.â
Cao Cao smiled. âI have served the Hans for many years. Even if I have
acquired some merit, yet I have been rewarded with a princedom and high rank. I
dare not aspire to greater things. If the finger of heaven points to me, then
shall I be as King Wen of Zhou.â
âAs Sun Quan acknowledges himself your servant and promises obedience, you,
my lord, can confer a title upon him and assign to him the duty of attacking
Liu Bei,â said Sima Yi.
Approving of the suggestion, Cao Cao gave Sun Quan the titles of General of the
Flying Cavalry and Lord of Nanzhang, and appointed him to the Imperial
Protectorship of Jingzhou. Forthwith this command was sent away to Sun Quan.
Cao Caoâs condition grew worse daily. One night he had a dream of three
horses feeding out of the same manger.
Next day he told it to Jia Xu, saying, âI saw three horses feeding on the
same manger before the family of Ma Teng was harmed. Last night I saw the same
dream again. How do you interpret it?â
âThe horses were feeding on bounty: It is auspicious to dream of dignity,â
replied Jia Xu. âAnd naturally such an honor comes to the Caos. I do not
think you need feel any misgivings.â
Cao Cao was comforted.
Cao Cao dreamed three steeds together fed,
The vision seers could not explain,
None guessed how soon, when Cao Cao was dead,
One dynasty would rule again.
Ah, yes, Cao Cao had vainly wrought;
Of none avail each wicked wile,
For, later, in Wei court, there fought
Against him one with equal guile.
That night Cao Cao became worse. As he lay on his couch he felt dizzy and could
not see, so he rose and sat by a table, upon which he leaned. It seemed to him
that someone shrieked, and, peering into the darkness, he perceived the forms
of many of his victims â-the Empress Fu, the Consort Dong, Fu Wan, Dong
Cheng, and more than twenty other officials â-, and all were bloodstained.
They stood in the obscurity and whispered, demanding his life. He rose, lifted
his sword and threw it wildly into the air. Just then there was a loud crash,
and the southwest corner of the new building came down. And Cao Cao fell with
it. His attendants raised him and bore him to another palace, where he might
lie at peace.
But he found no peace. The next night was disturbed by the ceaseless wailing of
men and womenâs voices.
When day dawned, Cao Cao sent for his officers, and said to them, âThirty
years have I spent in the turmoil of war and have always refused belief in the
supernatural. But what does all this mean?â
âO Prince, you should summon the Daoists to offer sacrifices and prayers,â
said they.
Cao Cao sighed, saying, âThe Wise Teacher said, âHe who offends against
heaven has no one to pray to.â I feel that my fate is accomplished, my days
have run, and there is no help.â
But he would not consent to call in the priests. Next day his symptoms were
worse. He was panting and could no longer see distinctly. He sent hastily for
Xiahou Dun, who came at once. But as Xiahou Dun drew near the doors, he too saw
the shadowy forms of the slain Empress and her children and many other victims
of Cao Caoâs cruelty. He was overcome with fear and fell to the ground. The
servants raised him and led him away, very ill.
Then Cao Cao called in four of his trusty advisers â-Cao Hong, Chen Qun, Jia
Xu, and Sima Yi â-that they might hear his last wishes.
Cao Hong, speaking for the four, said, âTake good care of your precious self,
O Prince, that you may quickly recover.â
But Cao Cao said, âThirty and more years have I gone up and down, and many
bold leaders have fallen before me. The only ones that remain are Sun Quan in
the south and Liu Bei in the west. I have not yet slain them. Now I am very
ill, and I shall never again stand before you; wherefore my family affairs must
be settled. My first born â-Cao Ang, son of Lady Liu â-fell in battle at
Wancheng, when he was young. The Lady Bian bore four sons to me, as you know.
The third, Cao Zhi, was my favorite, but he was vain and unreliable, fond of
wine and lax in morals. Therefore he is not my heir. My second son, Cao Zhang,
is valiant, but imprudent. The fourth, Cao Xiong, is a weakly and may not live
long. My eldest, Cao Pi, is steady and serious; he is fit to succeed me; and I
look to you to support him.â
Cao Hong and the others wept as they heard these words, and they left the
chamber. Then Cao Cao bade his servants bring all of the rare incenses and
fragrances that he burned every day, and he handed out to his handmaids.
And he said to them, âAfter my death you must diligently attend to your
womanly labors. You can make silken shoes for sale, and so earn your own
living.â
He also bade them go on living in the Bronze Bird Pavilion and celebrate a
daily sacrifice for him, with music by the singing women, and presentation of
the eatables laid before his tablet.
Next he commanded that seventy-two sites for a tomb should be selected near
Jiangwu, that no one should know his actual burying place, lest his remains
should be dug up.
And when these final orders had been given, he sighed a few times, shed some
tears, and died. He was sixty-six, and passed away in the first month of the
twenty-fifth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity Era (AD 220).
A certain poet composed âA Song of Yejunâ expressing sympathy for Cao Cao,
which is given here:
I stood in Yejun and saw the River Zhang
Go gliding by. I thought no common human
Ever rose from such a place. Or he was great
In war, a poet, or an artist skilled.
Perchance a model minister, or son,
Or famous for fraternal duty shown.
The thoughts of heroes are not ours to judge,
Nor are their actions for our eyes to see.
A man may stand the first in merit; then
His crimes may brand him chief of criminals.
And so his reputationâs fair and foul;
His literary gifts may bear the mark
Of genius; he may be a ruler born;
But this is certain: He will stand above
His fellows, herding not with common people.
Takes he the field, then is he bold in fight;
Would he a mansion build, a palace springs.
In all things great, his genius masters him.
And such was Cao Cao. He could never be
Obedient; he a rebel was, foredoomed.
He seized and ruled, but hungered for more power;
Became a prince, and still was not content.
And yet this man of glorious career
When gripped by sickness, wept as might a child.
Full well he knew, when on the bed of death,
That all is vanity and nothing worth.
His latest acts were kindly. Simple gifts
Of fragrant incense gave he to the maids.
Ah! The ancientsâ splendid deeds or secret thoughts
We may not measure with our puny rule.
But criticize them, pedants, as ye may
The mighty dead will smile at what you say.
As Cao Cao breathed his last, the whole of those present raised a great wailing
and lamentation. The news was sent to the members of the family, the Heir Cao
Pi, Lord of Yanling Cao Zhang, Lord of Linzi Cao Zhi, and Lord of Xiaohuai Cao
Xiong. They wrapped the body in its shroud, enclosed it in a silver shell, and
laid it in a golden coffin, which was sent at once home to Yejun.
The eldest son wept aloud at the tidings and went out with all his following to
meet the procession and escort the body of his father into his home. The coffin
was laid in a great hall beside the main building, and all the officials in
deep mourning wailed in the hall.
Suddenly one stood out from the ranks of the mourners and said, âI would
request the heir to cease lamentation for the dead and devote himself to the
present needs of state.â
It was Sima Fu, and he continued, âThe death of the Prince will cause an
upheaval in the empire, and it is essential that the heir should assume his
dignity without loss of time. There is not mourning alone to be seen to.â
The others replied. âThe succession is settled, but the investiture can
hardly proceed without the necessary edict from the Emperor. That must be
secured.â
Said Chen Jiao, who was Minister of War, âAs the Prince died away from home,
it may be that disputes will ensue, and the country will be in danger.â
Then Chen Jiao slashed off the sleeves of his robe with a sword and shouted
fiercely, âWe will invest the prince forthwith, and anyone who does not
agree, let him be treated as this robe.â
Still fear held most of the assembly. Then arrived Hua Xin most haste from the
capital. They wondered what his sudden arrival meant.
Soon he entered the hall and said, âThe Prince of Wei is dead and the world
is in commotion. Why do you not invest his successor quickly?â
âWe await the command,â cried they in chorus, âand also the order of
Princess-Mother Bian concerning the heirship.â
âI have procured the imperial edict here,â cried he, pulling it out from
his breast.
They all jumped up and down to shout their congratulations. And Hua Xin read
the edict.
Hua Xin had always been devoted to Wei. As soon as he knew of Cao Caoâs
death, he drafted this edict and got it sealed by Emperor Xian almost by force.
However, there it was: Therein Cao Pi was named as Prince of Wei, First
Minister, and Imperial Protector of Jizhou.â
Cao Pi thereupon took his seat in the princely place and received the exultant
congratulations of all the officers. This was followed by a great banquet.
However, all was not to pass too smoothly. While the banquet was in progress,
the news came: âCao Zhang, Lord of Yanling, with an army of one hundred
thousand troops, is approaching from Changan.â
In a state of consternation, the new Prince turned to his courtiers, saying,
âWhat shall I do? This young, golden-bearded brother of mine, always
obstinate and determined and with no little military skill, is marching hither
with an army to contest my inheritance.â
âLet me go to see the Marquis. I can make him desist,â said one of the
guests.
The others cried, âOnly yourself, O Exalted One, can save us in this
peril!â
Quarrel between two sons of Cao Cao
Just as in the House of Yuan Shao.
If you would know who proposed himself as envoy, read the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 79 ****
All eyes turned toward the speaker, High Minister Jia Kui, and the young prince
commanded him to undertake the mission. So he went out of the city and sought
to speak with Cao Zhang. Cao Zhang came quickly to the point.
âWho has the late Princeâs seal?â asked he.
Jia Kui replied seriously, âThere is an eldest son to a house, and an heir-
apparent to a state. Such a question from your lordship is unbecoming.â
Cao Zhang held his peace, and the two proceeded into the city to the gates of
the Palace. There Jia Kui suddenly asked him, âYou come as a mourner or as a
rival claimant?â
âI am come as a mourner. I never had any ulterior motive.â
âThat being so. Why bring in your soldiers?â
Whereupon Cao Zhang ordered his escort to retire, and entered the city alone.
When the Cao brothers met, they fell into each otherâs arms and wept. Then
Cao Zhang yielded command of all his army, and he was directed to go back to
Yanling and guard it. He obediently withdrew.
Cao Pi, being now firmly established, changed the name of the period of his
rule to the Prolonged Wealth Era, the First Year (AD 220). He made Jia Xu Grand
Commander, Hua Xin Prime Minister, and Wang Lang High Minister, and made many
promotions. To the late Prince, he gave the posthumous title of the King of
Great Might, and buried him in Gaoling.
To the superintendence of the building of King Caoâs tomb, Cao Pi nominated
Yu Jin, but with malevolent intent. For when Yu Jin reached his post, he found
the walls of the rooms decorated with chalk sketches depicting the drowning of
the seven armies and the capture of himself by Guan Yu. Guan Yu was looking
very dignified and severe. Pang De was refusing to bow to the victor, while Yu
Jin himself was lying in the dust pleading for his life.
Cao Pi had chosen this method of putting Yu Jin to open shame, because Yu Jin
had not preferred death to the dishonor of capture, and had sent an artist on
purpose to depict the shameful scenes. When Yu Jin saw them, shame and rage
alternately took possession of him till he fell ill. Soon after he died.
War waged he for many a year,
Yet fell prey to craven fear.
None can know anotherâs heart,
Drawing tigers, with bones start.
Soon after the accession, Hua Xin memorialized the Prince of Wei, saying,
âThe Lord of Yanling has cut himself loose from his army and gone quietly to
his post, but your other two brothers did not attend the funeral of their
father. Their conduct should be inquired into and punished.â
Cao Pi took up the suggestion and sent commissioners to each.
They who were sent to the younger quickly returned to report: âCao Xiong, the
Lord of Xiaohuai, had hanged himself rather than suffer for his fault.â
Cao Pi ordered honorable burial for Cao Xiong and gave him the posthumous title
of Prince of Xiaohuai.
Soon after, the envoy to Linzi returned to report: âThe Lord of Linzi, Cao
Zhi, is spending his time in dissipation, his especial boon companions being
two brothers named Ding Yi and Ding Yin. They were very rude. When we presented
ourselves, Cao Zhi sat bolt upright, but would not say a word. Ding Yi used
insulting words, saying, âKing Cao intended our lord to succeed, but was
turned there from by the slanderous tongues of certain among you. As soon as he
is dead, your master begins to think of punishment for his own flesh and
blood.â
âThe other brother Ding Yin said, âIn intellect our lord leads the age, and
he ought to have been heir to his father. Now, not only does he not succeed,
but he is treated in this harsh way by a lot of courtiers of your sort,
ignorant of what genius means.â
âAnd then Cao Zhi, in a fit of anger, had ordered his lictors to beat the
chief envoy and turn him out.â
This treatment of his messenger annoyed Cao Pi greatly, and he dispatched a
force of three thousand Imperial Tiger Guards under Xu Chu to arrest his
brother and all his immediate surroundings. When Xu Chu arrived Linzi, the Gate
Commander stopped him. Xu Chu slew that general and entered the city,
unchallenged. He went to the residence and found Cao Zhi and all his companions
dead drunk. So he bound them, put them into carts, and sent them to court in
Yejun. He also arrested all the officers of the palace.
Cao Piâs first order was to put to death Ding Yi and Ding Yin. The two
brothers were not wholly base; they had a reputation for learning, and many
were sorry for them.
Cao Piâs mother, Lady Bian, was alarmed at the severity of the new rule, and
the suicide of her youngest son wounded her deeply. When she heard that Cao Zhi
had been arrested and his comrades put to death, she left her palace and went
to see her eldest son. As soon as he saw her, the Prince hastened to meet her.
She began to weep.
âYour brother has always had that weakness for wine, but we let him go his
way out of consideration for his undoubted ability. I hope you will not forget
he is your brother and that I bore you both. Spare his life that I may close my
eyes in peace when I set out for the deep springs.â
âI also admire his ability, Mother, and have no intention to hurt him. But I
would reform him. Have no anxiety as to his fate,â said Cao Pi.
So the mother was comforted and withdrew. The Prince then went to a private
room and bade them call his brother.
Said Hua Xin, âSurely the Princess-Mother has just been interceding for your
brother. Is it not so?â
âIt is so,â replied the Prince.
âThen let me say that Cao Zhi is too clever to be content to remain in a
humble station. If you do not remove him, he will do you harm.â
âI must obey my motherâs command.â
âPeople say your brother simply talks in literature. I do not believe it
myself, but he might be put to the test. If he bears a false reputation, you
can slay him; if what they say is true, then degrade him, lest the scholars of
the land should babble.â
Soon Cao Zhi came, and in a state of great trepidation bowed low before his
elder brother, confessing his fault.
The Prince addressed him, saying, âThough we are brothers, yet the proper
relation between us of prince and minister must not be overlooked. Why then did
you behave indecorously? While the late Prince lived, you made a boast of your
literary powers, but I am disposed to think you may have made use of
anotherâs pen. Now I require you to compose a poem within the time taken to
walk seven paces, and I will spare your life if you succeed. If you fail, then
I shall punish you with rigor.â
âWill you suggest a theme?â asked Cao Zhi.
Now there was hanging in the hall a black and white sketch of two bulls that
had been fighting at the foot of a wall, and one of them had just fallen dead
into a well. Cao Pi pointed to the sketch and said, âTake that as the
subject. But you are forbidden to use the words âtwo bulls, one bull,
fighting, wallâs foot, falling, well, and deadâ.â
Cao Zhi took seven paces and then recited this poem:
ï¿½Two butcherâs victims lowing walked along,
Each head bore curving bones, a sturdy pair,
They met just by a hillock, both were strong,
Each would avoid a pit newly dug there.
They fought unequal battle, for at length
One lay below a gory mass, inert.
It was not that they were of unequal strength
Though wrathful both, one did not strength exert.ï¿½
This exhibition of skill amazed the Prince and the whole court. Cao Pi thought
he would use another test, so he bade his brother improvise on the theme of
their fraternal relationship, the words âbrotherhoodâ or âbrotherâ
being barred. Without seeming to reflect, Cao Zhi rattled off this rhyme:
ï¿½They were boiling beans on a beanstalk fire;
Came a plaintive voice from the pot,
âO why, since we sprang from the selfsame root,
Should you kill me with anger hot?âï¿½
The allusion in these verses to the cruel treatment of one member of a family
by another was not lost upon Cao Pi, and he dropped a few silent tears.
The mother of both men came out at this moment from her abiding place and said,
âShould the elder brother thus oppress the younger?â
The Prince jumped from his seat, saying, âMy mother, the laws of the state
cannot be nullified.â
Cao Zhi was degraded to the rank of Lord of Anxiang. He accepted the decision
without a murmur and at once left his brotherâs court by horse.
Cao Piâs accession was the signal for a set of new laws and new commands. His
behavior toward Emperor Xian was more intemperate than his fatherâs had ever
been.
The stories of his harshness reached Chengdu and almost frightened Liu Bei, who
summoned his counselors to discuss what he should do.
Said he, âSince the death of Cao Cao and the accession of his son, the
position of the Emperor has changed for the worse. Sun Quan acknowledges the
lordship of Wei, and its influence is becoming too great. I am disposed to
destroy Sun Quan in revenge for the death of my brother. That done. I will
proceed to the Capital District and purge the whole land of rebellion. What
think you?â
Then Liao Hua stood out from the ranks of officers and threw himself upon the
earth, saying with tears, âLiu Feng and Meng Da were the true cause of the
death of your brother and his adopted son. Both these renegades deserve
death.â
Liu Bei was of the same opinion and was going to send and arrest them
forthwith, but here Zhuge Liang intervened and gave wiser advice.
âThat is not the way. Go slowly or you may stir up strife. Promote these two
and separate them. After that you may arrest.â
The Prince of Hanzhong saw the prudence of this procedure and stayed his hand.
He raised Liu Feng to the Governorship of Mianzhu, and so separated the two
delinquents.
Now Peng Yang and Meng Da were old friends. Hearing what was afoot, the former
hastened home and wrote warning his friend. The letter was confided to a trusty
messenger to bear to Meng Da. The messenger was caught as he went out of the
city and carried before Ma Chao, who thus got wind of the business. He then
went to Peng Yangâs house, where, nothing being suspected, he was received
kindly and wine was brought in. The two drank for some time.
When Ma Chao thought his host sufficiently off his guard, he said, âThe
Prince of Hanzhong used to look on you with great favor. Why does he do so no
longer?â
The host began to rave against his master.
âThe obstinate old leather-belly! But I will find some way to pay him out.â
In order to see to what lengths he would go, Ma Chao led him on, saying,
âTruth to tell, I have long hated the man too.â
âThen you join Meng Da and attack, while I will win over the people of East
and West River Lands. That will make it easy enough,â said Peng Yang.
âWhat you propose is very feasible, but we will talk it over again
tomorrow,â said Ma Chao, and took leave.
Taking with him the captured man and the letter he carried, Ma Chao then
proceeded to see the Prince, to whom he related the whole story. Liu Bei was
very angry and at once had the intended traitor arrested and put in prison,
where he was examined under torture to get at full details.
While Peng Yang lay in prison, bitterly but vainly repentant, Liu Bei consulted
his adviser.
âThat fellow Peng Yang meant to turn traitor. What shall I do with him?â
âThe fellow is something of a scholar, but irresponsible,â replied Zhuge
Liang. âHe is too dangerous to be left alive.â
Thereupon orders were given that he should be allowed to commit suicide in
gaol. The news that Peng Yang had been made away frightened his sympathizer and
friend, Meng Da, and put him in a quandary. Further, Liu Fengâs promotion and
transfer to Mianzhu arrived, and it frightened him still more. So he sought
advice from two friends and commanders, the brothers Shen Dan and Shen Yi, who
lived in Shangyong.
âMy friend Peng Yang and I did much for the Prince of Hanzhong. But now Peng
Yang is dead, and I am forgotten. More than that, the Prince wishes to put me
to death. What can I do?â said Meng Da.
Shen Dan replied, âI think I can find a plan that will secure your safety.â
âWhat is it?â asked Meng Da, feeling happier.
âDesertion. My brother Shen Yi and I have long desired to go over to Wei. You
just write the Prince of Hanzhong a memorial resigning your service and betake
yourself to the Prince of Wei, who will certainly employ you in some honorable
way. Then we two will follow.â
Meng Da saw that this was his best course, so he wrote a memorandum, which he
gave to the messenger who had brought the recent dispatches to take back with
him. That night Meng Da left his post and went to Wei.
The messenger returned to Chengdu, handed in Meng Daâs memorial, and told the
story of his desertion. The Prince was angry. He tore open the letter and read:
âIn the humble opinion of thy servant, O Prince, you have set out to
accomplish a task comparable with that of Yi Yin, and to walk in the
meritorious footsteps of Lu Wang in building the fame of Dukes Wen and Huan.
When the great design was rough-hewn, you had the support of the lands of the
states of Wu and Chu, wherefore many people of ability incontinently joined
you. Since I entered your service, I have committed many faults; and if I
recognize them, how much more do you see them! Now, O Prince, you are
surrounded by famous people, while I, useless as a helper at home and inept as
a leader abroad, should be shamed were I to take a place among them.
âIt is well known that when Fan Li saw certain eventualities, he went sailing
on the lakes, and Zi Fan acknowledged his faults and stayed by the rivers.
Inasmuch as one cannot take means of safeguarding oneâs self at the critical
and dangerous moment, I desire â-as is my duty â-to go away as I came,
untainted. Moreover, I am stupid and without use or merit, merely born in these
days as the sport of circumstances.
âIn the days of old, Shen Sheng, though perfectly filial, incurred the
suspicions of his father and died; Wu Zixu, though perfectly loyal, was put to
death. Meng Tian, though he extended the borders of Qin, suffered the extreme
penalty; and Yue Yi, though he destroyed the might of Qi, was the victim of
calumny. Whenever I have read of these men, I have been moved to tears, and now
I am in like case and the more mortified.
âLately Jingzhou was overwhelmed, and I, an officer of rank, failed in my
duty, not one in a hundred behaving as I should. Only I return Fangling and
Shangyong and seek service abroad. Now I desire you, O Prince, graciously to
understand, to sympathize with thy servant and to condone the step he is about
to take. Really I am but a mean man, incapable of great deeds. I know what I am
doing, and I dare to say it is no small fault.
âThey say that dissolution of bonds should not occasion recrimination, and
the dismissed servant should take leave without heart-burning. I have taken
your orders many times, and now, O Prince, you must act yourself. I write this
with extreme trepidation.â
But the reading gave rise to great anger in the breast of the Prince.
âThe unmerited fellow!â said he. âHe turns traitor and dares to insult me
by sending a letter of farewell.â
Liu Bei was just giving orders to send a force to seize the deserter, when
Zhuge Liang interposed, saying, âYou had better send Liu Feng to capture him
and let the two tigers worry each other to weakness. Whether Liu Feng succeeds
or fails, he will have to come to the capital, and you can kill him. Thus will
you cut off two evils.â
Liu Bei took his advice. Orders were sent to Mianzhu, and Liu Feng obediently
led out his troops.
Now Meng Da arrived when Cao Pi was holding a great council. When the
attendants told him that General Meng Da of Shu had come, Cao Pi summoned him
to enter.
Said Cao Pi to him, âIs this a sincere surrender?â
Meng Da replied, âI was in fear of death for not having relieved Guan Yu.
That is my only reason for coming.â
However, Cao Pi did not trust him. Then they reported that Liu Feng was coming
to arrest him, with a large army, and had attacked Xiangyang and was
challenging Meng Da to battle.
Cao Pi said, âYou seem to be true. Go then to Xiangyang and take Liu Feng. If
you bring me his head, I shall no longer doubt.â
Meng Da replied, âI will convince him by argument. No soldiers will be
needed. I will bring him to surrender too.â
So Meng Da was made General Who Establishes Strong Arms, Lord of Pingyang, and
Governor of Xincheng, and sent to guard Xiangyang and Fancheng.
Now there were two generals there already, Xiahou Shang and Xu Huang, who
engaged in reducing the surrounding territories. Meng Da arrived, met his two
colleagues, and was told that Liu Feng was fifteen miles from the city.
Whereupon Meng Da wrote him a letter urging him to surrender. But Liu Feng was
in no mood to surrender. Instead he tore up the letter and put the messenger to
death.
âThe renegade has already made me offend against my duty to my uncle, and now
would sever me from my father so that I shall be reproached as disloyal and
unfilial,â said Liu Feng.
Meng Da went out with his army to give battle. Liu Feng rode to the front,
pointed with his sword at his opponent, and railed against him.
âDeath is very near you!â replied Meng Da. âYet you continue obstinately
in the way of foolishness and will not understand.â
Liu Feng rode out flourishing his sword. He engaged Meng Da, who ran away
before the conflict had well begun. Liu Feng pursued hotly to seven miles. Then
he fell into an ambush and found himself attacked on two sides by Xiahou Shang
and Xu Huang. Also Meng Da returned to the attack. Liu Feng was forced to fly.
He made straight for Shangyong, pursued all the way. When he reached the city
and hailed the gate, he was met by a volley of arrows.
âI have surrendered to Wei!â cried Shen Dan from the city tower.
Liu Feng got furious and prepared to attack the wall, but the army of Wei was
close behind, and having no resting place, he set off for Fangling. He arrived
there to find the banners of Wei set out along the walls. Then he saw Shen Yi
wave a signal from the tower, and at once there appeared from the shelter of
the wall a body of soldiers, and the leading banner displayed General of the
Right Army Xu Huang.
Liu Feng was worsted by the ambush. Then he made for home. But he was pursued,
and only a hundred riders of his remained to him when he regained Chengdu.
Seeking an interview with his father, he found but scant sympathy.
In response to his petition, made prostrate, and weeping, Liu Bei said,
âShameful son! How are you come to see me at all?â
âMy uncleâs mishap was not due to my refusal of help, but because Meng Da
thwarted me.â
âYou eat as a man, you dress as a man; but you have no more the instincts of
a man than an image of clay or wood. What mean you by saying another wretch
thwarted you?â
Liu Bei bade the executioners expel Liu Feng and put him to death. But the
Prince felt some compunction later when he heard of Liu Fengâs treatment to
the messenger who had brought Meng Daâs letter inviting him to become a
traitor. And he gave way to grief for the death of Guan Yu until he fell ill.
So no military movements were made.
After he had succeeded to the princedom, Cao Pi raised all his officers to high
rank and had an army prepared of three hundred thousand, and maneuvered them
over the southern territories and made great feasts in the county of Qiao in
the old state of Pei, which was the land of his ancestors. As the grand army
passed by, the aged villagers lined the roads offering gifts of wine, just as
when the Founder of the Hans returned home to Pei.
When it was announced that the Regent Marshal Xiahou Dun was near death, Cao Pi
hastened back to Yejun, but arrived too late to see him. He put on mourning for
the great leader and instituted magnificent funeral ceremonies.
In the eighth month of that same year (AD 220), it was reported that a phoenix
had been seen to bow at Shiyi, and a jilin had appeared at Linzi, while a
yellow dragon was observed in Yejun.
Whereupon Imperial Commander Li Qu and Minister Xu Zhi discussed these
appearances, and putting them all together they concluded, saying, âThose
splendid signs presage that Wei is about to supplant Han, and the altar of
abdication should be set up.â
Presently a deputation of forty high officers, both military and civil, led by
Hua Xin, Wang Lang, Xin Pi, Jia Xu, Liu Ye, Liu Zi, Chen Jiao, Chen Qun, and
Huan Jie went into the Forbidden City and proposed to Emperor Xian that he
should abdicate and yield to the Prince of Wei, Cao Pi.
It is time to set up the Throne of Wei,
And steal the land from the Hans.
The next chapter will record the Emperorâs reply.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 80 ****
Hua Xin was the spokesman of the deputation of officers that went into the
Forbidden City, and he spoke thus: âSince the inauguration of the Prince of
Wei, virtue has spread to the four corners of the empire and humanity has
permeated all the earth to a degree unexcelled in all the ages, even in the
days of the ancient rulers, King Tang and King Yu. We, your servants, have
taken account of these things and have reached the conclusion that the fortunes
of Han is worn out, wherefore we trust Your Majesty, in imitation of the great
prototypes King Yao and King Shun, will yield the mountains, the rivers, and
the peoples to a more able guardian and high priest of the sacrifices in the
person of the Prince of Wei, thereby pleasing Heaven and satisfying the hearts
of humans, and enabling Your Majesty to enjoy the happiness of freedom and
repose from the exacting duties of the chief ruler. The happiness of your
ancestors and of humanity at large would thereby be enhanced. Having thoroughly
debated this matter, we have come to lay it before you.â
The Emperor listened in amazement, and for a time could not reply.
Then, looking at the assembly, he said sadly, âHow can I abandon my empire
for the sake of repose â-the empire won by my Great Ancestor, its Founder,
when, with a three-span sword, he slew the Snake and restored Right, and
consolidated when he reduced Qin and overwhelmed Chu â-the empire which has
been handed down for four centuries? Though I possess not brilliant talents,
yet I have done no wrong. Go back and debate this again in a just and moderate
spirit.â
Then Hua Xin led forward Xu Zhi and Li Qu nearer the throne, saying, âIf Your
Majesty thinks we may be mistaken, pray ask these two, who will explain.â
Said Li Qu, âSince the Prince of Wei has taken his seat, the Jilin has
descended, the Phoenix has appeared, the Yellow Dragon has come forth, the
Grain of Felicity has flourished, and Sweet Dew has watered the earth. All
these things augur that Heaven decrees a change, and Wei must replace Han.â
Xu Zhi continued, âThe astrologers, watching the aspect of the skies at
night, have seen the blazing light of the star of Han gradually fade away and
Your Majestyâs own star become dim. On the other hand, the aspect of the sky
and the attitude of the earth have been wholly bright in favor of Wei to a
degree hard to state in words. Moreover, the lots have been cast, and they gave
the words âDevil, at the side, has been sent, there must be an inroad upon
Han without wordâ; another lot, âWord, in east, light moves west, two suns
radiating as the air blows southâ. These oracles gave two words which,
joined, compose Xu; âtwo suns, one on the otherâ, which is Chang. These
signs are unmistakeable, for when put together the whole reads, âWei at
Xuchang is to receive the abdication of Han.â If you consider, Your Majesty
must admit this.â
âAll empty words and madness, this talk of auguries and lots! Is it
reasonable that I should suddenly abandon the great heritage for such
nonsense?â
Then Wang Lang said, âWax and wane has been the law of all things from the
beginning; every period of glory is followed by one of obscurity. Has any rule
endured forever or any House never failed? The rule of Han, handed down through
four centuries to Yourself, has lost its vigor, and the time has come to yield.
Retirement may not be delayed, or confusion will ensue.â
The Emperor wept aloud and retired to his private chamber, while the officers
left the hall laughing.
Next morning they assembled in the court, but the Emperor did not appear. So
they sent the Palace officers to request his presence. Still he feared to show
himself.
Empress Cao asked him, âWhy do Your Majesty not hold the court as usual,
especially when you are requested to go out?â
âBecause your brother wishes to depose me and become Emperor himself. He has
set the whole host of officers against me to force me to abdicate, and I will
not expose myself to this compulsion.â
âBut what can have induced my brother to do such a dreadfully rebellious
thing?â said she angrily.
Just as she spoke, Cao Hong and Cao Xiu, both armed, forced their way into the
inner apartments and requested His Majesty to come to the Hall of Audience.
The Empress broke out into abuse: âSo you are two of the disorderly rebels
who, for the sake of your own ends, have conspired to upset all the good
service of my father. Though he overshadowed the whole land, yet he never dared
to aspire to the sacred throne. But my brother, who has only just succeeded
him, sets no bounds to his ambition and temerity and would usurp the Throne.
Heaven will surely cut off his offspring!â
She wept bitterly as she went away, and the attendants sobbed and wept too. But
Cao Xiu and Cao Hong still urged the Emperor to go to the Hall of Audience, and
at last he had to yield. There Hua Xin took up the question again.
âYour Majesty should act as was advised yesterday and so avoid any
misfortune.â
The Emperor sobbed, âAll of you have eaten of the bounty of Han for years,
and among you are many whose fathers and grandfathers were conspicuous for
merit. How can you bring yourselves to act thus improperly toward me?â
âIf Your Majesty refuses to follow advice, I fear that there will soon be
trouble in the family. Really we are not disloyal.â
âWho would dare to murder me?â cried the Emperor.
âEveryone knows that Your Majesty lacks the happy attributes of a successful
ruler and that is why there is so much confusion in the country. If it were not
for the presence of the Prince of Wei in your court, many people would murder
you. Your Majesty has never yet learned how to treat people; is your sole
desire to set people against you?â
The Emperor, alarmed at the violence of his language, shook out his sleeves and
rose to go away. Then Wang Lang glanced at Hua Xin, who rushed forward and
seized the Emperor by the sleeve.
âIs it consent or not?â cried he angrily. âOne word!â
The Emperor was dumb with terror.
âWhere is the Keeper of the Seal?â shouted Cao Hong and Cao Xiu, drawing
their swords.
âThe Keeper of the Seal is here,â said Zu Bi, stepping calmly to the front.
They tried to force the seal from him, but he cried, âThe Seal belongs to the
Emperor, and I will not yield it!â
Cao Hong called up the executioners and told them to behead him, which they
did. Zu Bi abused the ruffians to the last breath.
Dethroned by wicked traitors was the ruling House of Han,
They falsely claimed as precedent the deeds of Yu and Tang.
The crowd of officers at court were all on Cao Piâs side,
Save one, Zu Bi the Keeper of the Seal, and loyally he died.
The Emperor was in a state of abject terror, and when he saw the whole court
filling up with armed guards, all the soldiers of Wei and so enemies, he burst
into tears.
âYes. I will give up the throne to the Prince, if haply I may be spared to
live out the few years Heaven has assigned me,â wailed he.
âThe Prince will always take care of Your Majesty,â said Jia Xu. âIt
would be as well to prepare the abdication manifesto quickly so as to preserve
tranquillity.â
Such a hint could not be missed, and Chen Qun was directed to draft the
document. As soon as it was finished, Hua Xin and a host of officers, took it
off to the Prince of Weiâs palace and presented it, with the Imperial
Hereditary Seal, in the name of the Emperor. Very joyfully, Cao Pi read this
writing:
âDuring the whole of my thirty-two years of reign the land has been in a
state of turmoil, but the spirits of my ancestors have preserved me in the
midst of danger. Now from the signs of the heavens and the hearts of the
people, I see that the virtue of the Hans is exhausted, and happy fortune has
devolved upon the House of Wei, as may be seen from the success in war enjoyed
by the late King Cao and the resplendent virtue of the present Prince, which
answers to the times.
âBy all noble principles the empire is no private possession, but a public
trust. Wherefore the great King Yao, to his eternal glory, passed over his own
son. How I admire this deed! Now in imitation thereof I have resolved to
abdicate in favor of my Chief Minister, the Prince of Wei, who will not, I
hope, disappoint my wishes.â
Cao Pi heard this and was going to accept it as final.
But Sima Yi said no: âAlthough the declaration and the seal have been sent,
yet decorum demands refusal at first so as to silence peopleâs criticism.â
Then Wang Lang drafted a memorial modestly declining the proposal of succession
on the ground of unfitness and asking that some other be sought. When this
reached the Emperor, he was much perturbed and asked what was to be done next.
Replied Hua Xin, âWhen his father was offered a princedom, he declined
thrice, but he finally accepted. Wherefore Your Majesty should renew the offer.
The Prince will end by acceptance.â
There was no help for it, and so Huan Jie was bidden to draft another
declaration of offer, which was sent by the hand of the Officer of the Dynastic
Temple, Zhang Yin, together with the emblems and the seal.
This new declaration read thus:
âTo the Prince of Wei. You have sent your modest refusal of my offer to
abdicate. But I have long since seen that the virtue of Han is passing, and I
could only rely upon the late Prince, your father, who virtuously undertook the
great task of removing the evil oppressors and purging the land. Now his son
Cao Pi has succeeded. His perfect virtue is resplendent, his fame universal and
his benevolence is wafted to all parts. The divine choice rests upon him.
âIn the days of old, Yao the Great would abdicate, and did so in favor of
Shun, who possessed merit after his twenty accomplishments; and the God-king
Shun in the same manner handed the Throne to Yu after Yu had labored to control
the floodwaters. The House of Han succeeded in the course of ages to the work
of Yao and now passes on the sacred trust, to promote the repose of the Earth
and manifest the command of Heaven.
âBy the hand of the Minister Zhang Yin, this is sent with the emblems and the
seal.â
Greatly rejoicing, Cao Pi received this.
But he said to Jia Xu, âAlthough I have received two such declarations, yet I
fear that I may not escape being branded as a usurper by posterity.â
âThat is easily arranged,â replied Jia Xu. âDirect Zhang Yin to take the
seal back again, and tell Hua Xin to cause the Emperor to set up a Terrace of
Abdication and select an auspicious day for the ceremony. Then assemble all the
officers at the terrace, and cause the Emperor to offer the seal with his own
hands and surrender the empire to you. Thus can you dissipate all doubts and
prevent any caviling.â
So the seal was once more rejected with a memorial to say so. Zhang Yin
returned, and the Emperor inquired of the courtiers how he was to understand
this act.
Then Hua Xin said, âYour Majesty can set up a Terrace of Abdication and
assemble nobles, officers, and common people to witness the act of abdication.
Thereafter the descendants of your House shall receive favor at the hands of
Wei.â
The Emperor consented and sent officials in the Office of Imperial Ceremonies
to select a site at Fanyang. And there they built a terrace of three stories,
and they chose an auspicious day of the tenth month for the act of abdication.
On the appointed day, Emperor Xian requested Cao Pi to ascend the terrace and
receive his abdication. At the foot of the terrace stood the officials, more
than four hundred, and the Imperial Guards and the Tiger Guards, and soldiers
to the number of three hundred thousand. Thereupon the Emperor presented the
seal, which Cao Pi received into his hands. Then all those about the terrace
knelt to listen to the reading of the manifesto:
âTo the Prince of Wei. In days of old, Yao yielded the empire to Shun, and
Shun in turn gave it to Yu. The will of Heaven does not follow the way of
mortals, but seeks the virtuous. The rule of Han has lost its virility and the
times are out of joint. When my turn came to rule, great disorder arose, and
evils stalked abroad till the empire was in danger of subversion. I trusted to
the military genius of the late Prince of Wei to restore order and purge away
the evil, whereby to ensure tranquillity to my House. What could my single hand
do to correct this and ensure peace for my Nine Domains?
âThe present Prince has succeeded to his father. He is also resplendent in
virtue, capable as Wu the Military King and Wen the Scholar King of the great
task, brilliant in the glory of his father. The spirit of the empire is upon
him; gods and humans declare his worth. To him be the bright reward, and let
him accept this mandate. For all say his capabilities fit him to stand beside
Yu.
âAs did my great predecessor, I respectfully retire that he may be set up.
The revolution of Heaven brings the glory upon his person, and he will accept
the high office and comfort all people by reverently obeying the decree of
Heaven.â
The reading finished, the Prince of Wei, Cao Pi, proceeded to the terrace and
ascended to the place of the Emperor. Then Jia Xu, at the head of the great
concourse of officers, came to the foot of the terrace, and a court was held.
The year of reign was changed from Prolonged Wealth, the first year, to Yellow
Dawn, the first year (AD 220), and the government became that of Great Wei. An
edict was then published proclaiming a general amnesty, and the title of
âFounder of the Dynastyâ was conferred upon the late Prince, Cao Cao.
Then said Hua Xin, âAs heaven has but one sun, so the people can have but one
ruler. The Hans have abdicated, and it is fitting that they withdraw to a
distance. I pray for an edict naming the place of residence of the Liu
family.â
Taking the late Emperor by the arm, Hua Xin led him forward and made him kneel
below the terrace to hear the command. Then the new Emperor Pi conferred upon
him the title of Duke of Shanyang, bidding him depart forthwith.
Thereupon Hua Xin drew his sword and in a harsh voice said, âIt is an old
rule that the setting up of one emperor means the degradation of another. Now,
through the gracious kindness of His Majesty, you are spared personal injury
and created a duke. Proceed at once and return not to court without express
command.â
The late Emperor Xian controlled his emotion, thanked the Emperor Pi for his
clemency and left on horseback. But those who saw the departure could not help
a feeling of pity for him.
Said Cao Pi to his courtiers, âNow I understand the story of Shun and Yu.â
Then they all shouted: âO Ruler, may thy life be eternal!â
The ruling policy of Han had failed them,
Dangers pressed in upon the House,
And the land they had held so long
Passed from them forever.
Little thought he, who then snatched their scepter,
That the precedent he then claimed
Would be used in due time by another
To justify the destruction of his own House.
The officials then requested Cao Pi to make a solemn declaration to Heaven and
Earth, which he did with humble obeisance.
But at this moment a sudden storm burst whirling up the dust and rolling along
stones till no one could see the face of his neighbor. All the lights on the
terrace were extinguished. The newly enthroned Emperor was terrified and fell
prostrate. He was borne away unconscious. When he revived, he was assisted into
the Palace, but for many days he was too ill to hold a court.
When he had somewhat recovered, he met his courtiers and received their
felicitations. He rewarded Hua Xin with the post of Minister of the Interior,
and Wang Lang with that of Minister of Works. All the officers were advanced in
rank. But as his recovery was slow, he began to think there was too much
witchcraft about the palaces at Xuchang and left it for Luoyang, where he
erected a large palace complex.
The tale of these doings reached Chengdu and caused great grief to the Prince
of Hanzhong, for he heard the rumors that the late Emperor had been put to
death. He issued an order for mourning to be worn and instituted sacrifices,
and he conferred the posthumous title of Emperor Xian the Filial on the late
Emperor. This worry brought on an illness, so that he could not transact the
business of the court, which was left in the hands of Zhuge Liang.
Then Zhuge Liang and some of his colleagues took counsel one with another,
saying, âThe empire cannot be one single day without its ruler, wherefore we
desire that our Prince should be honored with the title of âEmperorâ.â
Qiao Zhou said, âThere have been auspicious indications. A yellow vapor has
been seen in the northwest of Chengdu rising to the clouds, and the star of
emperor has greatly increased in splendor and shined like the moon. These signs
mean that our Prince is to become Emperor in succession to the House of Han.
There can be no doubt.â
Whereupon Zhuge Liang and Xu Jing, at the head of a large number of officers,
presented a memorial requesting the Prince to assume the title of Emperor. But
Liu Bei objected.
âO Nobles, do you desire to set my feet in the way of disloyalty and wrong-
doing?â
âNot so,â said Zhuge Liang. âBut Cao Pi has usurped the Throne, while you
are a scion of the House. It is right and proper that you succeed and prolong
the line.â
But the Prince suddenly showed anger, saying, âCan I imitate the deeds of
such a rebel?â
He rose and left the chamber, going to his own apartments. So the officials
dispersed.
But three days later Zhuge Liang again led a deputation to the court, and they
requested that the Prince should come forth and hear them. He came, and they
all prostrated themselves.
Xu Jing spoke, âThe late Emperor of the Hans has been slain by Cao Pi. You, O
Prince, will fail both in loyalty and rectitude if you do not assume the
succession and destroy the wrong-doers. The whole empire requests you to rule
that you may avenge the death of the late Emperor, and the people will be
disappointed if you do not accede to their wishes.â
The Prince replied, âAlthough I am descended from the grandson of Emperor
Jing, I have not been of the least advantage. If I assumed the title of
âEmperorâ, how would that act differ from usurpation?â
Zhuge Liang pleaded with him again and again, but the Prince remained obdurate.
Then Zhuge Liang bethought that where argument failed a ruse might succeed. So
having arranged the parts his several colleagues were to play, he pleaded
illness and remained at home. Presently it was told the Prince that his
adviserâs condition was becoming serious, wherefore Liu Bei went to see him
as he lay on his couch.
âWhat illness affects you, my Commander-in-Chief?â asked Liu Bei.
âMy heart is sad like unto burning, and I shall soon die.â
âWhat is it that causes you such grief?â
But Zhuge Liang did not reply. And when the question was repeated again and
again he said nothing, but just lay with his eyes closed as if he was too ill
to speak.
The Prince, however, pressed him to reply, and then with a deep sigh Zhuge
Liang said, âGreat Prince, from the day I left my humble cottage to follow
you, you have always listened to my words and accepted my advice, and now this
western domain, the whole of the two River Lands is yours just as I said it
would be. But this usurpation of Cao Pi means the annihilation of the Hans and
the cessation of their sacrifices, wherefore my colleagues and I desired you to
become Emperor in order to crush this upstart Wei and restore the Hans. We all
worked for this end, never thinking that you would refuse so obstinately to
accede to our wishes. Now the officers are all annoyed, and they will drift
away before very long. If you are left alone and Wu and Wei come to attack, it
will be difficult for you to hold on to what you have. Do you not think this
sufficient reason for me to feel grieved?â
âUnless I refused, the whole world would blame me. I am afraid,â replied
the Prince.
Quoting Confucius the Teacher, Zhuge Liang replied, ââIf names be not
correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things.â In other
words, if one be not really straight, people will not speak of one favorably. O
Prince, you are straight, and people speak of you favorably. What more is there
to say? You know when Heaven offers and you refuse, you are certainly to
blame.â
âWhen you have recovered, it shall be done,â said the Prince.
Up leapt Zhuge Liang from his bed, tapped at the screen in front of a doorway
and in rushed a number of high officers, who prostrated themselves, crying,
âSo you have consented, O Prince! Then choose the day for the ceremony.â
They were all the most trusted of his court: Imperial Guardian Xu Jing, General
Who Brings Peace to Han Mi Zhu; Lord of Qingyi Xiang Ju, Lord of Yangquan Liu
Bao, Deputy Governor Zhao Zuo; First Secretary Yang Hong, Counselor Du Qiong,
Secretary Zhang Shuang, Minister Lai Gong, Minister Huang Quan, Minister He
Zong, Doctorate Scholar Yin Mo, Minister Qiao Zhou, Grand Commander Yin Chun,
Imperial Commander Zhang Si, Treasurer Wang Mou, Doctorate Scholar Yi Ji,
Counselor Qin Mi, and many others.
The Prince was greatly startled, and said, âYou are committing me to doing
what is dishonorable!â
But Zhuge Liang said, âSince consent has been given, let a terrace be built
and a day chosen for the great ceremony.â
The Prince was escorted back to his palace, and Academician Xu Ci and High
Counselor Meng Guang were told off to see to the building of the terrace at
Mount Wudan south of Chengdu. And when all was ready, a great concourse of
officers solemnly escorted the Prince, seated in a carriage of the imperial
pattern, to the ground prepared, and he went up to the altar and performed the
appointed sacrifice.
This done, the solemn announcement was read in a loud voice by Qiao Zhou:
âOn this twelfth day of the fourth month of the twenty-fifth year of the
Rebuilt Tranquillity Era, Liu Bei, the Emperor, makes this solemn announcement
to Heaven and Earth.
âThe dynasty of Han has possessed the empire for years without end. Formerly
Wang Mang rebelled against his sovereign, and Liu Xiu the Founder of Latter Han
rose in his wrath and put Wang Mang to death, thus restoring the prerogatives
of the great sacrifices to him who rightly exercised them. Lately Cao Cao,
powerful and cruel, slew the Empress, and his crimes cry aloud to Heaven for
vengeance. His son, Cao Pi, carrying evils into every quarter, then seized the
scepter.
âMy officials and leaders, regarding the dynasty as having been overthrown,
think it fitting that I, Liu Bei, would continue the line. As successor to my
two warrior ancestors, Liu Bang and Liu Xiu, I will punish as Heaven decrees.
âFearing lest my virtue be inadequate to the Imperial Throne, I consulted the
voices of the people, and all, even the most distant, have said that the
mandate of Heaven may not be disobeyed, the great task of my ancestors may not
discontinue, the land must have a lord, and they aver the cynosure of all eyes
is myself.
ï¿½Now I, respecting the mandate of Heaven and fearing lest the great
achievements of Liu Bang and Liu Xiu may be overthrown, have reverently
selected this auspicious day to ascend the altar, sacrifice, and announce my
assumption of the Imperial Seal in order to comfort all the people, rejoice the
ancestors of the Dynastic House, and bring eternal tranquillity to all
domains.â
When the reading was ended, and the sacrifice and the prayer, Zhuge Liang, in
the name of all those assembled, presented the Imperial Seal.
The Prince received it in both hands, laid it upon the altar, and again
declined acceptance, saying, âI, Liu Bei, am unfitted. I pray that another,
more able, may be chosen.â
But Zhuge Liang said, âOur lord has settled the empire, and his merits are
manifest to the whole world. Moreover, he is of the Dynastic Family, and it is
fitting that he succeed. Now that the great announcement has been made, such
self-abnegation is impossible.â
So all the officers shouted, âEternal life to the Emperor!â And they did
obeisance.
Then the style of the reign was announced to be Manifest Might, the first year
(AD 220). The Lady Wu was declared Empress, and the eldest son, Liu Shan, was
declared Heir-Apparent. The second son Liu Yung was made Prince of Lu, and the
third son Liu Li, Prince of Liang (the ancient states of Lu and Liang). Zhuge
Liang became Prime Minister, and Xu Jing, Minister of the Interior. Many others
were promoted, and a general amnesty was proclaimed, so that there was great
rejoicing throughout all the length and breadth of the two River Lands.
Next day the first court was held, and after the ceremonial prostration, and
when they were all arranged in due order, the First Ruler made a pronouncement.
âIn the Peach Garden I and my brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei pledged
ourselves to live and die together. Unhappily my brother Guan Yu came to his
end at the hands of Sun Quan of Wu, and I must avenge him lest I fail to
fulfill the oath. Therefore will I devote the whole force of my kingdom to the
destruction of Wu and the capture of its rebellious chief, whereby to wipe away
my reproach.â
But just as he closed this oration, an officer threw himself down at the foot
of the throne, crying, âIt may not be so!â
All eyes turned to this man. He was Tiger General Zhao Zilong.
âDire vengeance will I wreak!â so cried the King,
His minister replied, âDo no such thing.â
What arguments were used will appear in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 81 ****
Zhao Zilong was opposed to the attempt to fight Wu, and spoke against the plan.
âThe real rebel was not Sun Quan, but Cao Cao. Now it is his son who has
usurped the Imperial Throne and called forth the anger of gods and humans. You
should first aim at the Land Within the Passes by camping on the River Wei,
from which to attack the rebel. After that the loyal people in the East of the
Passes will cart their grains and herd their horses to welcome your army. If
you leave River Wei out of consideration in order to fight Wu, your military
force will be engaged, and could you disengage it quickly in case of necessity?
It is worth reflection.â
The First Ruler replied, âSun Quan slew my brother. Furthermore, Fu Shiren,
Mi Fang, Pan Zhang, and Ma Zhong are on his side, all of whom I hate so much
that I could eat their flesh with gusto and devour their relatives, whereby I
should have my vengeance. Why, Noble Sir, do you obstruct me?â
âBecause the enmity against Cao Cao is a public matter; vengeance for the
manner of your brotherâs end is private. The empire should be placed
first.â
âWhat care I for myriads of square miles of territory as long as my brother
is unavenged?â
So Zhao Zilongâs remonstrance was disregarded, and orders went forth to
prepare an army against Wu. The First Ruler also sent into the Five Valleys to
borrow the aid of fifty thousand of tribesmen. He sent a messenger to Langzhong
conferring on Zhang Fei the rank of General of the Flying Cavalry and the title
of Lord of Xixiang. Zhang Fei became also Governor of Langzhong.
When Zhang Fei heard the tidings of Guan Yuâs death at the hands of Sun Quan,
he wept very bitterly day and night, so that his raiment was soaked with his
tears. His subordinates tried to cheer him with wine, but he over-drank, and
this increased his ill-humor, which he vented on any offender in his camp. Some
of his people even died under the lash. Every day he gazed southward, grinding
his teeth with rage and glaring. He wept and groaned without ceasing.
Then a messenger was announced. He was summoned immediately, and Zhang Fei at
once tore open and read his dispatches. When Zhang Fei read the edict, he
accepted his new rank in all humility, bowing northward toward the imperial
mandate. Then he gave a banquet to the messenger.
He said, âMy enmity for the death of my brother is deep as the sea. Why do
not the officers at the court propose an avenging expedition?â
The messenger replied, âMost of them favor first the destruction of Wei. Wu
is to follow.â
âWhat sort of talk is this?â cried Zhang Fei angrily. âWhen we three
swore brotherhood in the Peach Garden, we pledged ourselves to die together.
Now, alas! my brother has perished by the way, and can we enjoy wealth or
honors without him? I must see the Son of Heaven and pray to be allowed to lead
the van. I will wear mourning, and in that garb I will smite Wu and capture the
bandit that rules there. Sun Quan shall be sacrificed to my brotherâs manes
in virtue of our oath.â
Zhang Fei accompanied the messenger to Capital Chengdu. In the meantime the
First Ruler had been training his armies. Day after day he went to the drill
ground, and he decided upon a day to start, and he would accompany the
expedition. Thereupon a number of courtiers went to the palace of the Prime
Minister to talk with Zhuge Liang, trying to get this intention modified.
They said, âIt is not in accordance with the importance due to the
Emperorâs position that he should go in personal command of this army,
particularly as he has but lately assumed his throne. You, Sir, hold the
weighty post of adviser in such a matter, and why do you not dissuade him?â
âI have done so, most sincerely and repeatedly, but he will not listen. But
now you all come with me to the drill ground, and we will try once more.â
So they proceeded thither, with Zhuge Liang at their head, and he said, âYour
Majesty has but lately taken the imperial seat. If the expedition was one to
march northward to destroy the rebels against Han and in the interest of
rectitude, it would be perfectly correct for the Emperor to lead the army. But
an officer of high rank should more properly be sent against Wu. Why should
Your Majesty expose yourself to such fatigues?â
The First Ruler was touched by the depth of his ministerâs concern and the
sincerity of his counsel, and was on the point of yielding when the arrival of
Zhang Fei was announced. Zhang Fei was immediately summoned and came to the
pavilion on the drill ground, where he threw himself on the ground and clasped
the First Rulerâs feet, weeping bitterly. The First Ruler joined in the
lamentation.
âYour Majesty is now ruler and too quickly forgets the oath in the Peach
Garden. Why is our brotherâs death not avenged?â
The First Ruler replied, âMany officers dissuade me from such a course. I
cannot act rashly.â
âWhat do others know of our oath? If Your Majesty will not go, then let me
sacrifice myself to avenge our brother. If I cannot, then would I rather die
and see your face no more.â
âThen will I go with you,â said the First Ruler. âBring your own troops
from Langzhong, and I will bring my veterans to meet you at Jiangzhou. We will
both attack Wu and wipe out the reproach.â
As Zhang Fei rose to take leave, the First Ruler said to him, âI know that
your weakness for wine leads you astray, and you become very cruel in your
cups, and hog your people, and keep the beaten ones near you. They may be
dangerous, and it is certainly the road to misfortune. Now you must be more
kindly and not give way to passion as before.â
Thus admonished, Zhang Fei said farewell and left.
Soon after, when the First Ruler was preparing to march out, High Minister Qin
Mi memorialized, saying, âThat Your Majesty, the Lord of a Myriad Chariots,
should risk his person in what is not the way of perfect rectitude is not what
the ancients would have done. I pray that this may be reflected upon.â
But the First Ruler replied, âGuan Yu and I were as one body, and the way of
perfect rectitude is here. Have you forgotten?â
But the officer remained at his feet and said, âI fear disaster if Your
Majesty disregards your servantâs words.â
The First Ruler replied angrily, âWhy do you use such bad words when I desire
to march?â
He bade the executioners thrust forth and put to death the bold speaker. Still
Qin Miâs face showed no sign of fear.
He only smiled, saying, âI die without regret. It is a pity that this newly
established state should be overturned ere it be well begun.â
Other officials interceding, the death punishment was remitted, but the
faithful officer was committed to prison.
âYour fate will be decided when the Army of Vengeance return,â said the
First Ruler.
Zhuge Liang sent up a memorial in favor of Qin Mi, saying:
âI, Zhuge Liang, address Your Majesty in my own name and those of my
colleagues. We regard as most grievous the recent events â-Wuâs perfidy, by
which Jingzhou was lost, the star of a great general was brought down, and the
pillar holding the sky was broken â-, and we shall never forget. But it is to
be remembered that the crime of overturning the Throne of Han rests on Cao Cao,
and the fault of driving away the Liu Family lies not on Sun Quan. We venture
to think that the destruction of Wei would cause the submission of Wu,
wherefore we beg consideration of the valuable words of Qin Mi. Thus the army
will be spared needless exertion and occasion given to make other plans for the
prosperity of the Throne and the happiness of the people.â
But having listened to the memorial, the First Ruler threw it to the floor,
saying, âI have decided, and no remonstrance should be raised!â
Then he appointed the Prime Minister to take care of his son and the two River
Lands. Then the Generals of the Flying Cavalry â-Ma Chao and Ma Dai â-,
together with the General Who Defends the North, Wei Yan, were ordered to guard
Hanzhong against Wei. The Tiger General Zhao Zilong was to be in reserve and to
control the supplies; Huang Quan and Cheng Jin were made Counselors; Ma Liang
and Chen Zhen, Secretaries; Huang Zhong, the Van Leader, assisted by the
Marching Generals Feng Xi and Zhang Nan; Fu Tong and Zhang Yi, Marching
Commanders of the Center Army; Zhao Rong and Liao Chun, the rear guards. The
whole army, including the borrowed foreign troops, numbered seven hundred fifty
thousand, and high-rank officials amounted several hundred. And the âtigerâ
day of the seventh month of the first year of Manifest Might was selected as
the most propitious day for the start.
As soon as Zhang Fei had got back to his post, he issued orders that his
soldiers should be ready to march in three days and the whole body was to be in
mourning, white uniforms and whitened arms.
Just after the order appeared, two generals named Fan Jiang and Zhang Da came
to their chief, saying, âThe time allowed is insufficient to make white flags
and armors. Pray give us more time, General.â
âI am hot to avenge my brother!â roared Zhang Fei. âMy only regret is
that I cannot reach the miserable wretchâs country tomorrow. Do you dare to
disobey my order?â
Zhang Fei called in the lictors, had the two officers bound to trees, and
ordered each to receive fifty lashes.
At the close of the flogging, he said, âNow you will be ready tomorrow. If
you are not, I will put you to death as an example!â
The two generals returned to their place, spitting blood and hot with anger.
They said one to another, âWe have been beaten today. What about tomorrow?
This manâs temper is unbearable; and if things are not ready, we shall suffer
death.â
âSuppose we slay him,â suddenly said Zhang Da, âsince if we do not, he
will kill us.â
âBut how can we get near him?â
âIf we are to have a chance to live, he will get drunk and go to bed tonight;
if we are to die, he will remain sober.â
They made all their arrangements for the crime.
That day Zhang Fei was greatly disturbed in his mind and restless.
He told some of his subordinates, saying, âI feel nervous and creepy and
shivery and cannot not rest. What does it mean?â
âThis is due to too much brooding over the loss of your brother,â said
they.
Then Zhang Fei bade them bring in wine, and he drank with his officers.
Presently he became quite intoxicated and lay down on a couch in his tent.
Meanwhile the two assassins had followed all his doings, and when they knew he
was lying on his couch intoxicated and incapable, they went into the tent, each
armed with a water-sharp dagger. They got rid of the attendants by saying they
had confidential matters to talk about and so got into the inner rooms.
But even then they dared do nothing, for Zhang Fei slept always with open
eyelids, and he lay on his couch as if still awake. However, huge snores soon
convinced them that their victim really slept, and they crept to the side of
the couch. Then both stabbed simultaneously deep into the body. Zhang Fei
uttered one cry and lay still. So he died at the hand of assassins at the age
of fifty-five years.
He who whipped the inspector in Anxi,
Who swept vile rebels from the land of Han,
And thereby won great glory for the Lius,
Whose valor shone at Tiger Trap Pass,
Who turned the tide of victory at Long Slope Bridge,
Who freed Yan Yan and thus won a friend
That helped him and his brothers conquer Shu,
Whose wisdom defeated Zhang He to get Hanzhong,
Is dead, the victim of assassinsâ blows.
Not his avenge his brotherâs death on Wu,
Langzhong will grieve him all the ages through.
Having done their victim to death, Fan Jiang and Zhang Da hacked off his head,
and made off for Wu without loss of time. Fleeing with them were a few dozen
close subordinates. When the deed was known, they had got too far for capture.
The assassination was reported in a memorial by a commander of Zhang Fei named
Hu Ban, who had been sent from Jingzhou to see the First Ruler and then
commissioned to serve under Zhang Fei. He wrote a memorial to the First Ruler
and bade the eldest son, Zhang Bao, prepare a coffin for the remains. After the
ceremony, leaving his younger brother, Zhang Shao, to hold Langzhong, Zhang Bao
went to see the Emperor.
The day of departure had already come, and the First Ruler had left the
capital. Zhuge Liang and many officers had escorted him out of the city for
three miles and taken leave.
Returning to Chengdu, Zhuge Liang felt ill at ease, and he remarked to his
colleagues, âIf Fa Zheng had been alive, he would have been able to interdict
this expedition.â
One night the First Ruler felt nervous and shuddered from time to time. He
could not sleep, so he went out of his tent and looked up at the stars.
Suddenly he saw a bright meteor fall in the northwest, and began to wonder what
the portent meant. He sent at once to ask Zhuge Liang to tell him.
Zhuge Liang sent back the reply: âThis means the loss of a great leader, and
there will be bad news in a few days.â
So the army was halted and did not march. Then the arrival of a message from Hu
Ban of Langzhong was announced.
The First Rulerâs foreboding increased, and he stamped his foot, saying,
âAlas! My other brother is gone!â
Opening the letter he found it was indeed so. As he read the news of the
assassination, he uttered a loud cry and fell in a swoon. He was raised, and
presently they brought him back to life.
Next day they reported a body of horsemen coming. The First Ruler went out of
the camp to look at them and presently saw a young general, dressed all in
white armor, sweeping forth in quite a terror. The First Ruler recognized that
was Zhang Bao.
As soon as Zhang Bao reached the First Rulerâs presence, he dismounted and
bowed to the earth, weeping, âMy father has been killed by Fan Jiang and
Zhang Da. They have gone over to Wu, taking my fatherâs head with them!â
The news was very grievous, and the First Ruler burst into tears and even
refused food.
His officers remonstrated, saying, âNow Your Majesty has the loss of two
brothers to avenge, and you must not destroy yourself.â
So after a time he began to eat and drink, and he then offered the leadership
of the van to Zhang Bao, saying, âAre you and Hu Ban willing to lead your
troops to attack Wu and to avenge your father?â
âFor my country or for my father, I would shrink from no sacrifice,â said
the young man.
Just as the force for the young manâs leadership was being organized, another
party of horsemen approached, also dressed in white armors. This was a small
force under Guan Xing, son of Guan Yu. The youth also threw himself to the
ground and wept.
At sight of Guan Xing, thoughts stirred in the First Rulerâs breast, and he
burst into tears. Neither reason nor persuasion could stop them.
âI think of the plain and simple days of long ago when we pledged ourselves
one to the other. Now I am Emperor. How I should rejoice to share my good
fortune with them! But they have met violent deaths, and the sight of these two
youths wrings my heart to the very core.â
âYoung gentlemen, please retire,â said the officers to the two youthful
generals, âand let our Sacred One repose his dragon body.â
They went.
Said the attendants, âYour Majesty is no longer young. You are over sixty,
remember, and it is not fitting that you give way to such extreme sorrow.â
âBut my brothers â-dead,â wailed the First Ruler. âHow can I live
without them?â
He broke into a fresh paroxysm and beat his head on the ground.
âWhat can be done?â asked the officers one to another. âHe is in such
trouble! How can we comfort him?â
Ma Liang said, âSire, it is bad for the army to spend whole days in wailing
and tears when leading against the enemy.â
And then Chen Zhen said, âThere is a certain hermit living among the Blue
Mountains, near Chengdu, who is said to be three hundred years old. He is
called Li Yin, and people say he is a seer. Let us tell His Majesty and let him
send for this old man that he may know what the future may have in store. It
will have more weight than anything we can say.â
They went to the First Ruler and told him. He agreed to summon the seer and
sent Chen Zhen with the command. Soon the messenger reached the town near the
hills and asked the people where the prophet dwelt. They led him far into a
secluded valley like a fairy village, very unlike any ordinary spot. Soon a lad
came to receive the visitor.
âYou are surely Chen Zhen.â
Chen Zhen was startled that the lad knew him, and still more so at the familiar
address, and said, âO superhuman boy, how do you know my name so well?â
âLast evening my master told me that a messenger with an imperial command
would come today and mentioned your name.â
âTruly he is more than wise,â said Chen Zhen. âHis reputation is not
unfounded.â
So the two proceeded to the old manâs abode, and Chen Zhen declared his
errand. The old man said he was too aged to travel.
âBut the Emperor anxiously desires to see you face to face, if haply you
would not mind making the effort.â
In the end, and after much persuasion, Li Yin consented and went. The First
Ruler received him affably, surprised at the contrast between his hoary head
and fresh boyish complexion. The venerable one had green eyes, with square and
sparkling pupils. His carriage was erect, and he stood straight as a pine tree.
âThis is no common man,â thought the First Ruler, and he treated him with
distinguished courtesy.
The seer said, âI am but an old man of the barren hill country, without
learning or wisdom. You shame me, O Emperor, by calling me, and I know not
why.â
âMy two brothers and I swore a mutual oath some thirty years ago. But now my
both brothers have gone, both by violent deaths. I would lead a great army to
avenge them and wish to know how the expedition will end. Hearing that you,
Venerable Sir, are learned in the deeper mysteries, I sent for you and beg you
to tell me.â
âBut this is fate. It is not for an old man like me to know.â
But the First Ruler pressed him to say. However, the aged one got paper and a
brush and wrote âsoldiers, horses, weaponsâ again and again on many sheets
of paper. Having done this, he suddenly tore them into fragments. Further, he
drew a picture of a tall man lying supine and another above him digging a
grave. And over all he wrote âwhiteâ.
After this he bowed and departed, leaving the First Ruler annoyed.
âThis is only a demented man. What he says is not worthy of confidence,â
said the First Ruler.
And he burned the paper. Then he ordered an advance at full speed.
Zhang Feiâs son, Zhang Bao, came in, saying, âHu Ban and his army have
come. I pray that I may be appointed to lead the van.â
The First Ruler admired his noble intent and gave him a Van Leaderâs seal.
But just as Zhang Bao was attaching the seal to his girdle, another youth
boldly stepped forth and said, âLeave that seal to me!â
It was Guan Xing, son of Guan Yu.
âI have already received my commission,â said Zhang Bao.
âWhat abilities have you for such a task?â cried Guan Xing.
âThat I have been training as a soldier since my boyhood. I can shoot and
never miss.â
âI should like to see your prowess,â said the First Ruler, âthat I may
decide who is the better.â
Zhang Bao ordered some of his people to set up a flag at a hundred paces, and
on the flag he drew a heart in red. Then he took his bow and shot three arrows,
each of which went through the heart. Those present commended the performance.
Then Guan Xing seized his bow, saying, âWhat is it to hit such a mark?â
Just as he said this a flock of wild geese flew over his head.
âI will hit the third of the flying geese,â said he.
He shot; and the third fell.
âFine!â cried all the assembly as one voice.
But Zhang Bao was enraged. Leaping on his steed, he seized the long serpent
halberd left him by his father, crying, âDare you try a real combat?â
Guan Xing took up the challenge at once. He sprang into the saddle, took his
great saber, and galloped out.
âYou can use the spear, think you that I cannot wield a sword?â cried he.
The two impetuous youths were on the point of a battle when the First Ruler
bade them hold.
âDo not behave so badly!â cried he.
Both dropped out of the saddle, threw aside their weapons, ran to his feet, and
begged pardon.
âYoung men, from the time I left my native place Zhuo and swore brotherhood
with your fathers, they were as my own flesh and blood. You two are also
brothers, and you should help each other in vengeance rather than quarrel and
dispute. You have lost the sense of rectitude while your fathersâ deaths are
still recent, and what will happen in future?â
Both fell at his feet and implored forgiveness.
âWhich of you two is the elder?â asked the First Ruler.
âI am the elder by a year,â said Zhang Bao.
The First Ruler then bade Guan Xing bow to Zhang Bao as to an elder brother,
and there, in front of all, they broke an arrow as a pledge that each would
always succor the other.
Then the First Ruler issued a mandate appointing Hu Ban the Van Leader, and the
two young men were enrolled as his own escort.
The advance began on land and on water, and they made a brave show as they
moved against the land of Wu.
In the meantime the two assassins, Fan Jiang and Zhang Da, with the grim
evidence of their deed, duly reached Wu and told their story to the Marquis who
received them.
Then Sun Quan said to his assembled officers, âLiu Bei has declared himself
Emperor and is leading against us in person a great host of more than seven
hundred thousand. What shall we do, for the danger is imminent?â
They all turned pale and looked one at another. Then Zhuge Jin spoke out.
âI have been in your service these many years and have never justified the
favor you have shown me. I will risk my life and go to this Liu Bei of Shu that
I may talk to him plainly and prove to him the advantages of friendship and
alliance against Cao Pi.â
This offer pleased Sun Quan, who then appointed Zhuge Jin as his messenger to
try to induce the First Ruler to keep the peace.
Messengers pass when states are at wrangle;
May this one succeed and unravel this tangle!
What fortune attended this messenger will be related in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 82 ****
In the eighth month of the first year of Manifest Might (AD 221) the First
Ruler marched at the head of his army and camped at Baidicheng (City of the
White Emperor), through the Kui Pass. His advanced guard had gone beyond the
River Lands when his attendants told him that Zhuge Jin had come as a messenger
from Wu. He told them not to admit Zhuge Jin.
But Huang Quan said, âHis brother being your Prime Minister, Zhuge Jin is
certainly come on some important mission. Your Majesty ought to see him and
hear what he says. If his proposals are admissible, then agree; if not, he can
be made use of to take knowledge of your intentions to Sun Quan and let Sun
Quan know that you intend to punish his crime.â
Then the First Ruler gave way, and the messenger was brought in. He bowed down
to the earth.
âZhuge Jin, you have come a long journey. What is its object?â said the
First Ruler.
âMy brother has long served Your Majesty; I have come at the risk of my life
to discuss Jingzhou affairs. When Guan Yu was at Jingzhou, my master repeatedly
sought to ally the two families by marriage, but was refused. When Guan Yu
attacked Xiangyang, Cao Cao wrote again and again urging my master to attack
Jingzhou. But the Marquis was unwilling, and it was the enmity between your
brother and Lu Meng that led to the attack and the unfortunate success.
âMy master is now very sorry for it, but it was Lu Mengâs doing. However,
Lu Meng is now dead, and his enmity has died with him. Moreover, Lady Sun is
always thinking over returning to you. My master now proposes to send back the
lady, to bind and hand over to you those officers who surrendered, and to
restore Jingzhou. If the two houses swear perpetual amity, then we may join
forces against Cao Pi and punish his usurpation.â
To this harangue the First Ruler only replied, âYou of East Wu killed my
brother. Yet you dare come with your artful talk!â
Zhuge Jin said, âI only wish to discuss the relative importance of the
issues. Your Majesty is an Imperial Uncle, and Cao Pi has seized the throne of
your House. Yet you do not think of destroying the usurper, but on the other
hand you disregard the most honorable position in the world for the sake of a
so-called brother, a connection of another name. Surely this is rejecting the
chief for the subordinate, the main issue for a detail.
âThe Middle Land is the biggest part of the empire, and the two capitals,
Luoyang and Changan, are both famous as places whence the two, one the Founder,
the other the Restorer, of the Hans, initiated their mighty task. Your Majesty
takes no thought of these, but would dispute over Jingzhou. In other words, the
important is abandoned for the worthless.
âAll the world knows of your assumption of the dignity of Emperor and that
you will assuredly restore the Hans and rescue their territory. Only now you do
not try to deal with Wei, you only desire to attack Wu. I venture to think you
have made a bad choice.â
All this argument only added fuel to the fire.
âThe slayer of my brother shall not live in the same world as I. You ask me
not to fight. I will cease when I have slain your master. Were it not for the
sake of your brother, I would behead you at once. As it is, you may go; and you
may tell your master to cleanse his neck ready for the blade of the
executioner.â
Zhuge Jin saw that the position was hopeless and took his leave to return to
the South Land.
But while Zhuge Jin had been absent, Zhang Zhao said to Sun Quan, âZhuge Jin
knows something of the strength of the Shu armies, and he made this mission an
excuse to get out of danger. He will not return.â
The Marquis replied, âHe and I are sworn friends â-friends to the death. I
shall not wrong him, nor will he betray me. When he was at Chaisang and Zhuge
Liang came to our country, I wanted my friend Zhuge Jin to persuade his brother
to remain with me. His reply was that his brother would not remain any more
than he himself would go: Each would be faithful to his salt. That was quite
clear enough. How could he desert me after that? Our friendship has something
of the divine in it, and no talk from outside can sow dissension between us.â
Even as Sun Quan spoke, the servants told him that Zhuge Jin had returned.
âWhat do you think now?â said Sun Quan.
Zhang Zhao retired overwhelmed with shame. The luckless messenger unfolded his
tale of failure.
âThen the South Land is in great danger,â said Sun Quan, as he heard the
story.
But a certain man here interposed, saying, âI have a way out of the
difficulty.â
He was Counselor Zhao Zi.
âWhat good scheme do you propose, friend Zhao Zi?â said Sun Quan.
âLet my lord draw up a document, which I will take to Cao Pi in Wei, making a
full statement of the case, and get him to attack Hanzhong and so draw off the
danger from our land.â
âThough the suggestion is good, yet shall we not lose something of our
dignity by that?â said Sun Quan.
âIf there is any such thing, I will simply jump into the river â-I could
not look the South Landâs people in the face again.â
Sun Quan was satisfied and composed the memorial, styling himself
âMinisterâ. Therein Zhao Zi was duly appointed messenger. He took the
document and soon reached Capital Xuchang, where he first sought out the High
Minister Jia Xu, and then saw the others.
Next day, Jia Xu stood forth one day at court and said, âEast Wu has sent a
high officer, Zhao Zi, with a memorial.â
âBecause he wants the armies of Shu driven off,â said Cao Pi, smiling.
But he summoned Zhao Zi, who, having prostrated himself in the outer court,
handed in his memorial.
After reading it, Cao Pi said, âWhat sort of an over-lord is the Marquis?â
âIntelligent, clear-sighted, wise, brave, and perspicacious,â was the
reply.
Cao Pi laughed, âYour praise is none too enthusiastic.â
âI do not wish to overstate,â replied Zhao Zi, âbut my master has shown
various qualities at different times. He made use of Lu Su among the officials
of high ranks, which shows his intelligence. He chose Lu Meng as leader of all
armies, which showed his clear-sightedness. He captured Yu Jin but did not hurt
him, which shows his kindliness. He took Jingzhou without slaughter, which
shows his wisdom. He maintains the Three Rivers so as to command the respect of
the empire, which shows his boldness. Lastly, he bows before Your Majesty,
which shows his perspicacity. You see now that my epithets are justifiable.â
âIs he at all learned?â
âSire, remember he commands a large fleet of ten thousand battleships and a
huge army of million armored soldiers. He endeavors to find wise and capable
people to help him, and his mind is full of plans and projects. When he has a
little leisure, he reads the histories and the annals, for the sake of the
general lessons to be learned therefrom. He is no dryasdust pedant seeking
remarkable passages and culling model sentences.â
âDo you think I could overcome Wu?â
âIf a large state has military force to attack, a small one has also
preparations for defense.â
âDoes Wu fear Wei?â asked Cao Pi.
âHow can you think so, considering our army of million armored soldiers and
the defensive moats we have in the River Han and the Great River?â
âHow many such persons as high minister does Wu possess?â
âNearly a hundred intelligent and specially qualified ministers like your
servants; of my sort of ordinary knowledge there are too many to reckon up.â
Cao Pi sighed, saying, âThe book says âGoing on mission without losing the
dignity of the master.â That is the sort of man you are!â
Thereupon he issued the mandate ordering Xing Zhen, Minister of Ceremonies and
Sacrifices, to be his ambassador to Wu, bearing for Sun Quan the title of
âPrince of Wuâ and allowing him to use the âNine Signs of Honorsâ.
But when the messenger had gone out of the city, Liu Ye went to remonstrate,
saying, âSun Quan has done this for fear of the armies of Shu. In my opinion,
if Shu and Wu fight, heaven will make an end of one country. If you will send
an army across the Great River to attack, and Shu attack at the same time from
the west, Wu as a state will disappear. If Wu goes, then Shu will be left alone
and can be dealt with when you will.â
âBut I cannot attack Sun Quan now that he has come over to my side. It would
prevent anyone else from doing so. No! I will really accept his submission. It
is the best course.â
Liu Ye said, âAfter all, though talented, he is but a General of the Flying
Cavalry and Lord of Nanzhang of the decadent days of Han. His rank is low and
his influence small, yet he still wants to contest the Middle Land. If you
promote him to kingly rank, he is only one step below yourself. While doubting
the reality of his submission, you give him an exalted rank and increase his
influence. Surely this is only giving wings to a tiger.â
âNot at all; I am helping neither Wu nor Shu. I am waiting till they are at
grips, and if one goes under, there will be only one left to destroy. That will
be easy. However, say no more, for I have decided.â
Whereupon Xing Zhen was bidden to take the mandate and the Nine Dignities and
accompany Zhao Zi to Wu.
Sun Quan assembled his officers to discuss how the armies of Shu could be
driven off. Then came the news of princely rank conferred by Wei. By the rules
of courtesy, the messenger bearing the edict should be met at a great distance
from the capital, but Gu Yong was opposed to accepting the rank.
âMy lord, you should style yourself âSupreme Rulerâ and âLordâ of the
nine territories. You should not receive any rank from Wei.â
âBut on one occasion Liu Bang received the princedom of Han (Hanzhong) from
Xiang Yu. I have to depend upon circumstances. Why refuse?â
Sun Quan discussed the matter no more, but went out at the head of a great
gathering of officers to welcome the messenger.
Xing Zhen, the bearer of the mandate from Wei, on first arrival comported
himself haughtily as the representative of a superior country and an imperial
ambassador. And when he entered the city, he did not descend from his carriage.
Wherefore Zhang Zhao ventured to rebuke him.
âEveryone must obey the rules of courtesy as everyone must respect the laws.
You, Sir, are behaving proudly as if there was no such thing as a sword in this
country.â
Immediately the messenger descended from his chariot and was presented to Sun
Quan. Afterwards they went in side by side.
As the cavalcade proceeded, a loud voice was heard in the rear of the two
carriages, crying, âHere we are prevented from risking our lives in smashing
Wei and swallowing Shu; and our lord receives a title from another man. Are not
such things shameful?â
The man was Xu Sheng.
And Xing Zhen sighed, saying, âIf all the leaders and ministers of the South
Land are like this, the Prince of Wu will not long be content to obey
another.â
However, the title was accepted. And when he had received the felicitations of
his officers, Sun Quan gave orders to collect beautiful works in jade and
brilliant pearls, which were sent to Wei as return gifts.
Not long after came tidings of the forces of Shu: âThe First Ruler, together
with King Shamo Ke of the Mang nations, leads his own army and a large number
of tribesmen from the east and south. Furthermore, he is aided by the two Shu
generals of Dongxi, Liu Ning and Du Lu, with their cohorts. They advance both
by land and by water, a mighty host, of which the shouting shakes the heavens.
The naval force has already come out at Wukou, and the land force has reached
Zigui.â
Although Sun Quan had been created a prince, yet Emperor Pi would not send a
relieve army.
When the terrible news came, the Prince of Wu asked present advice from his
officers, saying, ï¿½How are we going to meet those forces?ï¿½
But there was none to help him. They only muttered and were silent.
âAh!â sighed he. âAfter Zhou Yu I had Lu Su, and Lu Meng succeeded Lu Su.
But now they have all three gone, and there is no one to share my troubles!â
But just then a very youthful general stepped out from the ranks of the
officials and said, with a lowly obeisance, âThough I am young, I am not a
little versed in the books of war, and with a few legions I could destroy the
power of Shu.â
Sun Quan recognized Sun Huan, the son of Sun Hu. Sun Hu was originally from the
Yu family, and he had served under Sun Jian, Sun Quanâs father. Sun Jian
loved the youth and gave him his own family name of Sun and so made him a
member of his own clan. Sun Hu had four sons, of whom Sun Huan was the eldest.
Sun Huan was an expert archer and horseman and had accompanied Sun Quan in
several campaigns, where he had distinguished himself well and had been given a
rank of Commander. At this time he was twenty-five.
âHow do you think you can overcome them?â
âThere are two able commanders under my command named Xie Jing and Li Yi,
both very brave. With a few legions I will capture Liu Bei.â
âThough you are brave, nephew, yet you are young and ought to have an
assistant.â
Thereupon Tiger General Zhu Ran stepped forward, saying, âLet me go.â
Sun Quan consented. He promoted Sun Huan to General of the Left Army, and he
told off fifty thousand of soldiers and marines, over whom he placed Sun Huan
and Zhu Ran as joint commanders. They were to start as soon as possible.
The scouts reported that the army of Shu was camped at Yidu, and Sun Huan led
half his army to the borders of that county and camped in three stockades.
Now the Shu General Hu Ban had received his seal as Leader of the Van. From the
day he left the borders of the River Lands, he had had uninterrupted success.
Everyone had submitted at the mere rumor of his coming. He had conducted his
campaign with unstained swords as far as Yidu. When he heard that Sun Huan was
camped there to oppose his progress, he sent back rapid messengers to the First
Ruler, who was then at Zigui.
The First Ruler got angry, saying, âSo they think this youth is able to
withstand me?â
âSince this nephew of Sun Quan has been made a leader,â said Guan Xing,
âit is unnecessary to send a leader of high rank. Let me go.â
âI was just wishing to see what you could do,â said the First Ruler, and he
gave him orders to go.
Just as Guan Xing was leaving, Zhang Bao stepped forth and asked permission to
go too.
âThen both go, my nephews,â said the Emperor. âBut you must be prudent
and not hasty.â
So they took leave, collected their troops and advanced. Sun Huan, hearing of
the coming of a large army, called out all his troops and drew up his array.
His two famous generals, Li Yi and Xie Jing, were placed by the great standard.
They watched the soldiers of Shu filing out and noted two leaders in silver
helmets and silver armors, riding on white horses, and the flags were white.
First came Zhang Bao with a long spear, and then Guan Xing carrying a great
saber.
âSun Huan, you tiny rascal, your time has come!â cried Zhang Bao abusively.
âHow dare you stand against the forces of Heaven?â
âYour father is a headless devil,â cried Sun Huan, no way backward in
reviling, âand you are going just now to join him. Donât you see?â
Then Zhang Bao rode at Sun Huan. From behind his chief, Xie Jing dashed out to
meet him. They fought nearly forty bouts, and then Xie Jing ran away with Zhang
Bao in pursuit.
When Li Yi saw his comrade overcome, he whipped up his steed and came into the
fray, whirling his silvered battle-ax. Zhang Bao fought twenty bouts with him,
but neither got the better.
Then in the army of Wu, a marching general named Tan Xiong, seeing that his two
comrades could not overcome Zhang Bao, shot a treacherous arrow from the ranks
and wounded Zhang Baoâs steed. Feeling the pang of the wound, the horse
bolted back to its own side, but fell before it reached it, throwing its rider
sprawling on the ground. Seeing this, Li Yi turned and rode toward the
prostrate leader to slay him with his battle-ax. But just as he was about to
deliver his blow, lo! a red flash came between, and his head rolled along the
earth.
The red flash was Guan Xingâs great sword. Seeing the horse fall and Li Yi
coming up, he had rushed in and dealt that fatal blow. And he had saved Zhang
Bao from death. Then they attacked and lay on so that Sun Huan suffered a great
defeat. Then each side beat the retreat and drew off.
Next day Sun Huan came out to offer battle again, and the two cousins went
forth together. Guan Xing, from horseback by the main standard, challenged his
enemy. Sun Huan rode out fiercely, and they two fought near thirty bouts. But
Sun Huan was not strong enough and drew off. The two youths followed and
reached his camp. Hu Ban, together with Feng Xi and Zhang Nan, also launched
another attack. Zhang Bao helped them with all his force and was the first to
force his way into the ranks of Wu. He came across Xie Jing, whom he slew with
a spear thrust. The soldiers of Wu scattered and fled, and the victory was on
the side of Shu.
But Guan Xing was missing. Zhang Bao was desperate, saying, âIf something
wrong happens to Guan Xing, I will not live!â
So he girded on his huge spear and rode far and wide seeking him. Presently he
met Guan Xing, bearing his sword in his left hand, while his right held a
captive.
âWho is this?â asked Zhang Bao.
âIn the melee I met an enemy,â said Guan Xing, âand I took him
prisoner.â
Then Zhang Bao recognized Tan Xiong, the man who had let fly the treacherous
arrow that had brought down his horse. The two returned to camp, where they
slew their prisoner and poured a libation of his blood to the dead horse.
After this they drew up a report of the victory for the First Ruler. Sun Huan
had lost his generals â-Li Yi, Xie Jing, and Tan Xiong â-as well as several
other officers and many troops. His army was too weakened to continue the
campaign, so he halted and sent back to Wu for reinforcements.
Then Generals Zhang Nan and Feng Xi said to Hu Ban, âThe power of Wu is
broken. Let us raid their encampment.â
But Hu Ban said, âThough so many have been lost, there are many left. Zhu
Ranâs marine force is in a strong position on the river and is untouched. If
you carry out your plan and the marines land in force and cut off our retreat,
we shall be in difficulties.â
âThat is easily met,â said Zhang Nan. âLet each of the two leaders Guan
Xing and Zhang Bao take five thousand troops and go into ambush in the valleys
to guard against any such move.â
Said Hu Ban, âI think it better to send some persons to pretend to be
deserters. Let them tell Zhu Ran of the plan to raid the camp, and Zhu Ran will
come to the rescue as soon as he sees fire. Then the ambushing soldiers can
attack him.â
They thought this a fine plan, and they made the necessary arrangements.
Hearing of the ill success and losses of his colleague Sun Huan, Zhu Ran was
already thinking of going to his help, when a few deserters appeared and
hoarded his ship.
He questioned them, and they said, âWe are Feng Xiâs soldiers, and we have
deserted because of unfair treatment. We have a secret to tell.â
âWhat secret can you betray?â
âTonight Feng Xi is going to make an attack upon General Sun Huanâs camp.
He thinks it is a good chance. They are going to raise a fire as a signal.â
Zhu Ran saw no reason to doubt the men, and he sent off at once to tell Sun
Huan. But the messenger never arrived, as Guan Xing intercepted and slew him.
Then Zhu Ran deliberated upon going to help.
âYou cannot trust what those soldiers said,â said Cui Yu, one of the
commanders. âBoth army and navy will be lost if anything goes wrong. No,
General; rather keep careful watch and let me go.â
Zhu Ran saw this was the wiser plan, so he gave Cui Yu ten thousand troops, and
Cui Yu left.
That night Hu Ban, Zhang Nan, and Feng Xi made an attack on Sun Huanâs camp
from three directions, and the soldiers were scattered and fled. Then the three
generals set the whole camp on fire. Cui Yu saw the flames as he marched and
pressed on. Then just as he was passing some hills, he came upon the ambush,
and Guan Xing and Zhang Bao poured out from left and right. Taken by surprise,
Cui Yu could only try to flee, but he met Zhang Bao, who made him prisoner.
When Zhu Ran heard the news, he was panic-stricken and dropped down-river
twenty miles. The remnant of Sun Huanâs troops ran away, following their
leader.
As they fled, Sun Huan inquired, âIs there any city ahead that has good
defense and granary?â
They told him, saying, âTo the north is Yiling, where we can camp.â
So they went thither.
Just as they reached the wall, their pursuers came up and the city was besieged
in all four sides.
Guan Xing and Zhang Bao brought the captive Cui Yu back to Zigui and saw the
First Ruler, who rejoiced at their success. The prisoner was put to death, and
the soldiers were rewarded. The effect of these victories spread far, so that
the leaders in Wu had no inclination to fight.
When the Prince of Wu received Sun Huanâs call for help, he was frightened
and knew not what to do.
So he called a great council, and he said, âSun Huan is besieged in Yiling,
and Zhu Ran has been defeated on the river. What can be done?â
Then Zhang Zhao said, âThough several of your commanders are dead, yet have
you many left. Half a score is enough to relieve your anxiety. Send Han Dang as
Commander, with Zhou Tai as his second, Pan Zhang as Van Leader, Ling Tong as
Rear Guard, Gan Ning in reserve. You want one hundred thousand troops.â
Sun Quan made the appointments as proposed. Gan Ning was very seriously ill
just then, but he accepted the task.
Now the First Ruler had made a line of forty camps from Wukou and Jianping to
Yiling, spreading twenty-five miles of distance.
He was exceedingly pleased with his two nephews, who had distinguished
themselves again and again, and he said, âThe generals that have followed me
since the early days have got aged, and thus no longer a big use. But now that
I have such two valorous nephews, I have no fear for Sun Quan.â
Then he heard of the coming of Sun Quanâs army under Han Dang and Zhou Tai,
and he wished to select a commander to oppose the Wu army.
But those near him reported: âHuang Zhong and a half dozen other officers
have run off to Wu!â
âHuang Zhong is no traitor,â said the First Ruler, smiling. âIt is only
that he heard what I happened to say about old and useless leaders. He will not
accept he is useless and wants to prove he is not.â
Then he called Guan Xing and Zhang Bao and said to them, âHuang Zhong may
fail in this enterprise of his, so I hope you two will not mind going to his
assistance. As soon as there is some success to report, get him to return and
do not let him come to grief.â
So the two got their troops together and went off to assist the aged warrior.
When young, success is easy, thine at will,
The aged servant fails, though willing still.
The next chapter will relate the outcome of Huang Zhongâs expedition.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 83 ****
In spring, the first month of the second year of Manifest Might (AD 221), the
veteran warrior Huang Zhong was among the officers who followed the First Ruler
to war against Wu. When he heard his master talk of old and incapable leaders,
he girded on his sword and with a few faithful followers made his way to the
camps at Yiling. He was welcomed by Hu Ban, the commander in charge of the
siege there.
âFor what reason do you come, O Veteran General?â asked he.
âI have followed the Emperor ever since he left Changsha, and I have done
diligent service. I am now over seventy, but my appetite is still good for ten
pounds of meat, and I can still stretch the strongest bow, and I can still ride
three hundred miles without fatigue. I am not weak or worn out. But our master
has been talking of old and useless leaders, and I am come to take part in the
fight with Wu. If I slay one of their leaders, he will see I may be old but not
worn out.â
Just about that time the leading division of the Wu army drew near the camp.
Huang Zhong hastily rose, went out of the tent, and mounted to go into the
battle.
âAged General, be careful!â said the generals.
But Huang Zhong paid no attention and set off at full speed. However, Hu Ban
and Feng Xi rode out to help him. As soon as he saw the array of the enemy, he
pulled up and challenged Commander Pan Zhang of the vanguard. Pan Zhang sent
out one of his generals, Shi Ji, to take the challenge. Shi Ji despised his
seed antagonist and rode lightly forth with his spear set, but in the third
bout Huang Zhong cut him down. This angered Pan Zhang who flourished the green-
dragon saber, the great sword of the old warrior Guan Yu which had passed into
his possession, and took up the battle. These two fought several bouts, and
neither was victor, for Huang Zhong was brimful of energy. His antagonist,
seeing that he could not overcome the old man, galloped off. Huang Zhong
pursued and smote his army and scored a full victory.
On his way back Huang Zhong fell in with the two youthful generals, Guan Xing
and Zhang Bao.
âWe come by the sacred command to aid you if necessary. And now that you have
scored so complete a victory, we pray you return to the main camp,â said
they.
But the veteran would not. Next day Pan Zhang came to challenge again, and
Huang Zhong at once accepted. Nor would he allow Guan Xing and Zhang Bao to
come with him, or accept assistance from any other.
He led out five thousand troops. Before many bouts had been exchanged, Pan
Zhang made a feint and got away. Huang Zhong pursued, shouting to him not to
flee.
âFlee not, for now will I avenge the death of Guan Yu!â cried he.
Huang Zhong pursued some ten miles, but presently he fell into an ambush and
found himself attacked from all sides â-Zhou Tai on the left, Han Dang on the
right, Ling Tong from behind, and the erstwhile flying Pan Zhang turned to
attack the front â-, so that he was surrounded and hemmed in. Huang Zhong
forced his way to retreat. But suddenly a great storm came on, the wind blowing
violently, and as Huang Zhong was passing some hills, an enemy cohort led by Ma
Zhong came down the slopes, and one of the arrows wounded the veteran in the
armpit. He nearly fell from his horse with the shock. The soldiers of Wu,
seeing Huang Zhong wounded, came on all together, but soon the two youthful
generals, Guan Xing and Zhang Bao, drove them off and scattered them. Thus they
rescued Huang Zhong.
He was taken back to the main camp. But he was old and his blood was thin, and
the wound gaped wide, so that he was near to die.
The First Ruler came to visit him and patted his back and said, âIt is my
fault, O Veteran General, that you have been hurt in the battle!â
âI am a soldier,â said the old man. âI am glad that I could serve Your
Majesty. But now I am seventy-five, and I have lived long enough. Be careful of
your own safety for the good of the state.â
These were his last words. He became unconscious and died that night. A poem
was written of him:
First among veterans stands Huang Zhong,
Who won great merit in the conquest of Shu.
Old, he still donned his coat of mail,
And laid his hand to the curving bow.
His valor was the talk of all the north,
Fear of his might maintained the west.
Tardy he bowed his snow-white head to death,
Fighting to the end â-in very truth a hero.
Huang Zhong passed away, and the First Ruler looked on, very sad. He made Huang
Zhong a grave in Chengdu and ordered an honorable burial there.
âMy brave general is gone,â sighed he, âand the third of my five Tiger
Generals, and I have been unable to avenge their death. It is very grievous!â
So the Emperor led the Imperial Guards to Xiaoting, where he summoned a great
assembly. He divided his forces into eight parts ready for an attack by land
and water. The marines were placed under Huang Quan, and he himself led the
land forces. It was then the second month of the second year of Manifest Might
Era (AD 221).
When Han Dang and Zhou Tai heard that the army of Shu was approaching, they
marched toward it. When near, the two armies were arrayed. The two leaders of
Wu rode out and saw the First Ruler riding out under the great standard with
his staff about him. A silken umbrella splashed with gold was over his head;
right and left were white banners, golden axes, and other insignia of an
emperor.
Then Han Dang spoke, âYour Majesty is now the Ruler of Shu. Why do you risk
your life in the battlefield? It would be most regrettable if any untoward
event happened.â
The First Ruler pointed the finger of scorn at the speaker and said, âYou
rats of Wu bereft me of my brother, and I have sworn that you shall not live
with me under the same sky!â
âWho dares plunge in among the enemy?â asked Han Dang, turning to those in
his train.
Marching General Xia Xun set his spear and rode to the front, and so did Zhang
Bao with a roar gallop out to meet him. But this thunderous voice affrighted
Xia Xun, and he sought to flee. Then Zhou Taiâs brother, Zhou Ping, seeing
that his colleague was panic-stricken, flourished his sword and rode out too.
At once Guan Xing dashed to the front. Zhang Bao roared again and thrusting at
Xia Xun and unhorsing him. This disconcerted Zhou Ping and enfeebled his
defense, so that Guan Xing speedily slew him with a slash. Then the two youths
rode furiously at Han Dang and Zhou Tai. They sought refuge in their battle
array.
âThe tiger fathers have not begotten curs of sons,â said the First Ruler
with a sigh of satisfaction.
Then he waved his whip as a signal to fall on, and the Wu army suffered a great
defeat. The Shu force of the eight divisions was irresistible as a river in
flood, and the slaughter was immense.
Gan Ning was in his ship ill, but he roused himself when he heard the armies of
Shu had come, and mounted to go into the battle. Soon he met a cohort of the
Mang soldiers. These warriors wore their hair loose and went barefoot. Their
weapons were bows and crossbows and long spears and swords and axes. And they
had shields to ward off blows. They were led by their own King Shamo Ke. His
face was spotted with red as if splashed with blood, and his eyes were green
and big. He rushed among Gan Ningâs troops wielding a spiked iron mace with
bone pendants, and he had two bows slung at his belt. He was terrible to look
upon.
Gan Ning recognized that he had no chance of victory against such a man and did
not engage Shamo Ke, but turned his steed to flee. But as Gan Ning fled, Shamo
Ke shot an arrow that pierced Gan Ningâs skull. Wounded as he was, Gan Ning
rode on to Fuchikou, but there he dismounted and sat under a big tree, where he
died. On the tree were many hundreds of crows, and they gathered round the
corpse as if to protect it.
The Prince of Wu was sore grieved at the news of Gan Ningâs death, and had
the remains buried honorably. Moreover, he raised a temple in Fuchikou to Gan
Ningâs memory.
Gan Ning was first of warriors in Wu,
With silken sails he stemmed the Great Riverâs tide,
Right loyally he served his prince, and true,
He made two ill friends put their hate aside.
Light horse led he by night a camp to raid,
And first he warmed his soldiers with generous wine.
In his resting place the holy crows welcome guests,
And fragrant incense smolders at his shrine.
This victory gave the First Ruler possession of Xiaoting. But at the muster
after the battle, Guan Xing did not appear. Search parties were sent to find
him, and they went far and wide beating the country around.
However, the dashing young soldier was only following in his fatherâs foe.
When Guan Xing had got in among the army of Wu, he had caught sight of Pan
Zhang, his especial enemy, and galloped in pursuit. In terror, Pan Zhang took
to the hills and disappeared in one of the valleys.
In seeking him, Guan Xing lost his way and went to and fro till it grew dark
without finding a way out. It was clear moonlight. Near midnight he came to a
farm, where he dismounted and knocked at the door. A venerable old man appeared
and asked who he was.
âI am a leader of the army, and I have lost my way. I beg a meal, for I am
starving,â said Guan Xing.
The old man led him into a hall lit by many candles, and there he saw in the
family altar a picture of Guan Yu. At once he began to wail and bowed before
it.
âWhy do you wail thus?â asked the old man.
âThis is my father,â said Guan Xing.
At this, the old man prostrated himself before his guest.
âWhy should you treat my father with such respect?â asked Guan Xing.
âThis place is sacred to his honored spirit. While he lived the people served
him, and now that he is a spirit should they not revere him the more? I have
been waiting for the armies of Shu to avenge his death, and it is indeed the
great good fortune of the people that you have come.â
Then the host brought forth wine and food and served his guest. Moreover, he
unsaddled and fed his horse.
In the third watch a knocking came at the door, and when the old man opened it,
the visitor was no other than Pan Zhang, the general of Wu. He also asked
shelter.
As Pan Zhang came in, Guan Xing recognized him and drew his sword, crying,
âStay, you ruffian! Do not flee!â
Pan Zhang turned to flee. But before he could turn, Guan Xing raised his sword:
It fell, and Pan Zhang lay dead. Taking the heart-blood of his dead enemy, Guan
Xing poured it in libation before the picture of his father. After that he took
possession of his fatherâs green-dragon saber, curved as the young moon.
Having hacked off the head of his fallen enemy, he fastened it to his bridle.
Then he took leave of his aged host, saddled his enemyâs horse, and rode away
toward his own camp.
The old man dragged the corpse of the dead commander outside and burned it.
Guan Xing had not gone very far when he heard the neighing of horses and soon
met a troop led by Ma Zhong, one of Pan Zhangâs generals, who was looking for
his chief. Ma Zhong fell into a great rage when he saw the head of Pan Zhang
swinging at the neck of Guan Xingâs horse and beheld the famous sword in his
hand. Ma Zhong galloped up furiously, and Guan Xing, who recognized an enemy of
his late father, rushed to meet him. Just as he would strike, however, Ma
Zhongâs three hundred troops galloped up to support their general, and Guan
Xing was surrounded. He was in dire danger, but just opportunely came up a
troop of horse led by his cousin Zhang Bao. At this, Ma Zhong, thinking
discretion the better part, drew off his army and rode away.
The two cousins pursued him. Before they had gone far, they met another force
under Mi Fang and Fu Shiren, who had come out to seek Ma Zhong. The two bodies
of soldiers met and fought, but the troops of Shu were too few for victory and
drew off. Thence they made their way to headquarters in Xiaoting, where they
told their adventures and presented the head of Pan Zhang. The First Ruler was
very pleased and rewarded all armed forces.
Ma Zhong went back and rejoined Han Dang and Zhou Tai. Then they collected
their troops, many wounded, and stationed them in various points.
Ma Zhong, together with Mi Fang and Fu Shiren, marched to the river bank and
encamped. The night they arrived, many soldiers were groaning with the pain of
their wounds.
Mi Fang, who was listening unknown to them, heard one of them say, âWe are
Jingzhou soldiers and victims of Lu Mengâs vile machinations. If we had only
remained under Liu Bei! Now he is Emperor and has set out to destroy Wu, and he
will do it one day. But he has a special grudge against Mi Fang and Fu Shiren.
Why should we not kill these two and go over to Shu? They will think we have
done well.â
Another said, âDo not be hasty. We will do it presently when there is a
chance.â
Mi Fang started as he heard this. He told Fu Shiren, saying, âThe troops are
mutinous, and we ourselves are in danger. Ma Zhong is an object of especial
hatred to the Ruler of Shu. Suppose we kill him and surrender. We can say we
were compelled to give in to Wu, but as soon as the news of the Emperor came
near, we wanted to get back.â
âIt will not do,â said Fu Shiren. âIf we go, they will kill us!â
âNo! The Ruler of Shu is liberal and kind. And the heir, Liu Shan, is my
nephew. They will surely not do any harm to a connection.â
In the end they decided to go. And in the third watch they made their way into
their chiefâs tent and stabbed him to death. Then they cut off his head, and
with their grisly trophy and a few dozen followers they set off for the camp of
the Ruler of Shu.
They arrived at the outposts and were taken to see Zhang Nan and Feng Xi, to
whom they told their tale. Next day they went into the main camp and were
admitted to the presence of the First Ruler, to whom they offered their trophy.
And they threw themselves on the ground and wept, saying âWe are not
traitors. We were the victims of Lu Mengâs wickedness. He said that Guan Yu
was dead and tricked us into giving up the cities. We could not help
surrendering. When we heard the Sacred Chariot had come, we slew Ma Zhong to
satisfy your vengeance, and we implore forgiveness.â
But the First Ruler was angry, and said, âI left Chengdu a long time ago. Why
did you not come to confess your fault before? Now you find yourselves in
danger, and so you come with this specious tale to try to save your lives. If I
pardon you, how shall I look my brother in the face when we meet beneath the
Nine Golden Springs?â
Then he bade Guan Xing set up an altar to his father in the camp, and thereon
the First Ruler offered the head of Ma Zhong in sacrifice before the tablet of
Guan Yu. This done, he had Guan Xing strip the two deserters and make them
kneel before the altar. And presently with his own hand, Guan Xing hewed them
in pieces as a sacrifice.
Presently Zhang Bao came in and wailed before the First Ruler, saying, âThe
two enemies of my uncle have been slain, but when will vengeance be taken upon
those of my father?â
âDo not grieve, my nephew,â said the First Ruler, âI am going to lay
waste the South Land and slay the whole of the curs that live there. I will
assuredly capture the two murderers of your father, and you shall hack them to
pieces as a sacrifice.â
Zhang Bao went away, still weeping.
About this time the fear of the First Ruler was very great among the people of
the South Land, who stood in dread of him so that they grieved night and day.
Han Dang and Zhou Tai were rather frightened too, and they sent a report to
their master of the assassination of Ma Zhong and what had befallen the
assassins.
Then Sun Quan was distressed and called together his counselors. At this
meeting Bu Zhi proposed submission and self-humiliation for the sake of peace.
Said he, âThere were five persons â-Lu Meng, Pan Zhang, Ma Zhong, Mi Fang,
and Fu Shiren â-whom Liu Bei had a grudge against, and they are all dead. Now
the objects of his hate are the murderers of Zhang Fei â-Fan Jiang and Zhang
Da. Why not send back Zhang Feiâs head, and these two assassins, and give up
Jingzhou and restore Lady Sun and ask for peace and alliance against Wei? This
will make the army of Shu retire, and we shall have peace.â
This proposal seemed good. So the head of Zhang Fei was enclosed in a
sandalwood box; Fan Jiang and Zhang Da were bound and put in a cage-cart. All
these were sent, with letters, by the hand of Cheng Bing to the camp at
Xiaoting.
The First Ruler was about to march farther east when they told him that a
messenger had come from the South Land and what he had brought.
The Ruler struck his forehead with both hands, saying, âThis is the direct
gift of Heaven through my youngest brotherâs spirit.â
He bade Zhang Bao prepare an altar whereon to sacrifice the heads of his
fatherâs assassins. When he opened the box and saw the fresh features of
Zhang Fei, he broke into wailing for the dead. Then the son hewed Fan Jiang and
Zhang Da in pieces and offered them upon the altar.
But this sacrifice did not appease the First Rulerâs anger, and he still
desired to destroy Wu. Whereupon Ma Liang remonstrated.
âYour enemies are now all dead: You are avenged. Wu has sent a high officer
with large concessions and awaits your reply.â
But the First Ruler angrily replied, âThe one I would grind to pieces is Sun
Quan. To act as he proposes and enter into alliance would be treachery to my
two brothers and a breach of our oath. Now I will exterminate Wu, and Wei shall
follow.â
He wished also to put the messenger to death to annihilate all emotions with
Wu, but relented when his officers insistently interceded.
Poor Cheng Bing ran off terrified, glad to escape with life. He went back and
told the Prince of Wu how implacable his enemy seemed.
Said he, âThe Ruler of Shu, not listening to words of peace, was determined
to level Wu before attacking Wei. Those under him protested in vain. What is to
be done?â
Sun Quan was frightened and bewildered.
Seeing this, Kan Ze stepped forward and said, âSince there is a sky-
supporting pillar, why not use it?â
âWhom do you refer to?â asked Sun Quan.
âYou once had perfect confidence in Zhou Yu, and he was followed by Lu Su,
equally able. Lu Meng succeeded and you pinned your faith upon him. Though now
Lu Meng is dead, yet there is Lu Xun. And he is quite near, in Jingzhou. He is
well-known to be a scholar, but really he is a bold and capable man, no whit
inferior to Zhou Yu, in my opinion. The plan that broke Guan Yu was his. If
anyone can destroy Shu, it is he. If he fails, then I will stand the same
punishment as may be his.â
âIf you had not spoken thus, my whole scheme might have gone amiss,â said
Sun Quan.
âLu Xun is a student,â said Zhang Zhao. âHe is no match for Liu Bei. You
may not use him.â
Gu Yong also said, âLu Xun is too young and too inexperienced. I fear he will
not be obeyed, and that will be mischievous.â
Bu Zhi added, âLu Xun is well enough to control a region, but he is not fit
for a big matter.â
Kan Ze got desperate, shouting, âIt is the only hope. I will guarantee him
with the lives of all my house!â
âI know he is able,â said Sun Quan, âand I have now made up my mind he is
the man. Gentlemen, that is enough.â
Lu Xun was called home. Lu Xun was originally named Lu Yi. He was a native of
Wujun in Wu, grandson of Lu Jun, who was Commander of the City Gates of the
Han, and son of Lu Yu, Commander of Jiujiang. He was eight spans in height,
with a beautiful face, like the finest jade.
When Lu Xun arrived at court and made his bow, Sun Quan said to him, âI wish
to send you in supreme command of all the forces against Shu.â
âSir, you have numerous old and tried officers under your command. I am very
young and not at all clever,â replied Lu Xun.
âKan Ze goes bail for you and pledges his whole house. Moreover, I know your
abilities. You must be Commander-in-Chief and may not refuse the
appointment.â
âBut what will happen if the officers do not support me?â
âHere is authority!â said Sun Quan, taking his own sword from his side and
giving it to Lu Xun. âSlay the disobedient and report afterwards.â
âI am grateful for this proof of confidence, but I dare not accept forthwith.
I pray you assemble all the officers and confer the office upon me in their
presence.â
Said Kan Ze, âThe ancient fashion was to set up a platform and thereon
present to the leader-elect a white yakâs tail and a golden ax with the seal
of office and commission. Thereafter his dignity and the reverence due from
others were beyond all question. It would be well, O Prince, to follow the old
rule. Choose a good day and appoint Lu Xun before all the world, and no one
will refuse support.â
An altar was begun at once. They worked at it day and night, and as soon as it
was finished a great assembly was called. Then Lu Xun was requested to ascend
and make his bow on receiving his appointment as Commander-in-Chief, General of
the Right Army, General Who Guards the West, and Lord of Fenglou. The sword of
authority and the seal of office were presented. His powers extended over the
six territories and the eighty-one counties of the South Land, over the forces
in Jingzhou and Wu.
And in charging him Sun Quan said, âDomestic affairs belong to me; outer
affairs are under your direction.â
Lu Xun then descended. He chose Xu Sheng and Ding Feng as commanders of his
guards, and the army lost no time in taking the field. The various dispositions
of horse and foot and navy were made, and dispatches were sent to the outlying
commanders.
When the dispatch reached Han Dang and Zhou Tai, who were camping near
Xiaoting, they were alarmed, saying, âWhy did the Prince appoint a mere
bookish student to the commandership of all armed forces?â
So when the new Commander-in-Chief came, they showed their discontent by a lack
of hearty support. Lu Xun went to his tent to receive the reports, and there
the majority of the officers manifested only sullen respect and unwilling
deference.
Then Lu Xun addressed them, saying, âBy order of my superior I am Commander-
in-Chief, and my commission is to destroy Shu. You, gentlemen, all know the
ordinary military rules, and you would do well to obey them. The law is no
respecter of persons, as those who disobey will find out. Do not have to regret
when it is too late.â
They nodded in sullen acquiescence.
Then Zhou Tai said, âThere is Sun Huan, nephew of our Prince. He is
surrounded at Yiling and is short of food. I venture to request you to send
relief to him and get him out, so that the Princeâs heart may be
comforted.â
âI know all about him. His soldiers are faithful, and he can easily maintain
his position. There is no need to go to his aid. When Shu is broken, he will be
free to come out.â
They all sniggered as they left the tent, and Han Dang did not fail to express
his contempt for the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief.
âThis will be the end of Wu,â said he to his colleague. âDid you note
what he said?â
âI tried him just to see what he would do,â said Zhou Tai. âYou see he
had no plan ready. He destroys Shu indeed!â
Next day general orders were issued for defense and prohibitions against giving
battle, which provoked more laughter at the incapable pedant, as they thought
him in command, and secret resolves to disobey. Moreover, the officers showed
their contempt by a general disregard of orders.
So once more Lu Xun assembled them and said, âYou know I am in command. Yet
the recent orders for defense have been disregarded. Why?â
Then Han Dang spoke up, âSome of us followed General Sun Ce when he first
subdued the South Land. Others won fame in destroying rebels, or in following
the present Prince in his campaigns. All of us have donned our armors and
gripped our weapons in many bloody fights. Now, Sir, you have been placed in
supreme command to repulse Shu, and there should be some plan of campaign made
for us at once, some dispositions of our forces, and some definite advance
toward that end. Instead of that we are told to strengthen our defenses and are
forbidden to fight. What are we to wait for? Will Heaven destroy our opponents
for us? We are not afraid to die. Why is our keenness left to be eaten away and
our energies wasted in idleness?â
All the others applauded this speech and cried that the speaker had expressed
their own ideas.
âGeneral Han Dang just says what we think: Let us fight a decisive battle,â
they cried.
The new leader waited till the uproar had subsided; then drawing his sword, he
shouted, âThat I am a student is true. But I have been entrusted with a great
task, a task for which the Prince of Wu considers me competent and for the
performance of which I am prepared to bear all the responsibilities. As for
you, you will do well to act on the defensive as I ordered and not allow
yourselves to be led astray into any attacks. And I shall put the disobedient
to death!â
This speech had little effect, and they dispersed grumbling and murmuring.
Meanwhile the Ruler of Shu had made a long chain of forty camps from Xiaoting
to the borders of the River Lands, spreading out two hundred miles. These base
camps looked very imposing with their fluttering banners by day and their fires
at night.
Then the spies came in and reported: âWu appointed Lu Xun as Commander-in-
Chief. Lu Xun ordered his commanders to defend strategic points and not to
engage in battle.â
âWhat sort of a man is this Lu Xun?â said the First Ruler.
âHe is a scholar among the people of Wu, and, though young, he is very
talented,â replied Ma Liang. âHis schemes are very deep. He was the author
of the villainous and crafty plan of attack on Jingzhou.â
âHis crafty scheme caused the deaths of my brothers. But now I shall have
him!â said the First Ruler angrily.
He gave orders to advance. But Ma Liang ventured to remonstrate and dissuade
him.
âBe very careful,â said he. âThis Lu Xun is no whit inferior to Zhou
Yu.â
âI have grown old in the field,â said the Emperor. âDonât you think me
a match for this callow youth?â
He confirmed the order to go forward, and they attacked passes and fords and
redoubts wherever they were.
Han Dang notified his chief of the movement of the Shu army, and Lu Xun, still
rather dubious of the strict obedience to his orders, hastened to the point of
danger. He found Han Dang on a hill surveying the enemyâs force, which
advanced like a great wave. Amidst the army they saw a wide yellow umbrella,
and Han Dang pointed it out.
âThat must be Liu Bei,â said he. âI should like to kill him!â
âCareful!â said Lu Xun. âSo far he has scored victory after victory, and
his soldiers are very keen and confident. Maintain a careful defense on high
grounds and do not go out to battle. If you do, you will lose. Impress that
upon your officers and soldiers and make them understand the strategy, while
you follow the enemyâs moves. They are hastening into the wide open space,
and I do not wish to hinder them. Nor will I accept any challenge to battle,
but wait till they have moved their camps into the forest and among the trees.
Then I shall have a scheme ready.â
Han Dang agreed so far as words went, but in his heart he was still ill-
conditioned. When the Shu army drew near, a small force came to challenge. They
shouted all sorts of abuse and hurled reproaches to put their opponents to
shame, but Lu Xun took no notice and bade his troops stop their ears. He would
not allow them to go out to battle, but he went from fort to redoubt,
encouraging the soldiers to remain carefully on the defensive.
The First Rulerâs heart burned within him at this refusal to come out to
battle.
Said Ma Liang, âLu Xun is a deep and crafty fellow. He recognizes the
disadvantages of Your Majestyâs troops in being far from their base, and from
spring to autumn he will not come out to fight till some move occurs that he
may profit by.â
âWhat ruse can he be contemplating?â said the First Ruler. âThe real fact
is that he is afraid. Their army has suffered nothing but defeat times and
again. They dare not meet us.â
One day the leader of the van, Feng Xi, memorialized the First Ruler, saying,
âThe weather is scorching, and the troops are camped in the full glare of
sun. Beside, water is scarce and hard to get.â
Thereupon orders were given to move the camps into the shade of the forest
close by and near the streams till the summer heats should have passed. This
order given, Feng Xi moved the camp to a retired and shady spot for his troops.
Ma Liang said, âIf our soldiers move, the enemy will rush out on us and we
shall be hard set.â
âI will provide for that,â said the First Ruler. âI will send Hu Ban with
ten thousand of our inferior troops to camp near their lines. But I will choose
eight thousand of veterans and place them in ambush. Hu Ban will have orders to
flee before the soldiers of Wu and lead them into my ambush if they come out,
and I will cut off their retreat. We ought to capture this precocious youth.â
âA genius in plans, a marvel of prevision!â cried all those about him as
this plan was unfolded. âNone of us can approach you in cleverness.â
So they felicitated their ruler.
But Ma Liang said, âThey say the Prime Minister is on a tour of inspection of
the defenses in the eastern portion of Shu, seeing that they are in good order
against any attack on the part of Wei. Why not send him a sketch of your
present dispositions of troops and ask his opinion?â
âI also am not entirely ignorant of the art of war, and I see no reason to
seek advice,â was the cold reply.
âThere is an old saying about hearing both sides,â said Ma Liang.
âWell, then you go round to all the camps and make a map and take it to the
Prime Minister. If he finds any fault, you may come and tell me.â
So Ma Liang went, while the First Ruler busied himself with getting his army
into shelter from the fierce heat of summer.
His move was no secret, and the scouts soon told Han Dang and Zhou Tai, who
rejoiced at the news and soon went to tell Lu Xun.
âAll the enemiesâ forty camps had been moved into the shade. Now, Sir, you
can attack!â said they.
That was not a bad plan, an ambush to set,
Thus thought he his chiefest opponent to get.
Whether Lu Xun acted upon the suggestion of his subordinates will be seen in
the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 84 ****
in search of cool shade, and the news was very welcome to Lu Xun. He went
forthwith to assure himself of the truth of the report and observe the new
position. A level plain lay at his feet, whereon he saw something short of ten
thousand Shu troops, the greater part of whom appeared invalids. On the banner
of their leader he read the name Van Leader Hu Ban.
âWe consider these troops children,â said Zhou Tai. âLet me and General
Han Dang go out and smite them. I will give the formal guarantee of victory.â
The Commander-in-Chief made no reply, but remained gazing out before him.
Presently he said, âIt seems to me that an air of slaughter is rising over
there from that valley. Surely there is an ambush there. These poor troops in
the foreground are nothing but a bait. No, Gentlemen, do not leave your
positions.â
Those who heard this took it only as another proof of the imbecility of their
pedant commander.
Next day Hu Banâs soldiers approached closer and challenged to battle,
swaggering about and brandishing their weapons and shouting volleys of abuse
without end. They manifested contempt by throwing off their armor and clothing
and moving to and fro with the utmost carelessness, bare bodies and naked
forms, blatantly unready to fight. Some even sat or lay asleep.
Xu Sheng and Ding Feng came to the Commander-in-Chiefâs tent to complain,
saying, âThose Shu soldiers despise us so much. Let us go out and punish
them!â
But Lu Xun only smiled, saying, âYou see things from the view point of brute
courage. You seem not to know the principles of war laid down by Sun Zi and Wu
Qi. This display is only meant to entice us into fight. You will see the
pretense yourselves in about three days.â
âIn three days the change of camp will be complete, and the enemy will be too
strongly posted for our success,â said they.
âI am just letting them move their camp.â
Xu Sheng and Ding Feng left the tent also sniggering.
But on the third day the officers were assembled at a look-out point, whence
they saw that the army under Hu Ban had left.
âThere is still a deadly look over the valley,â said Lu Xun, pointing to
the hills. âLiu Bei will soon appear.â
Very soon they saw a whole army all well accoutered pass across the field
escorting the First Ruler. And the sight took away all their courage.
âThat is why I would not listen to those of you who wanted to fight Hu
Ban,â said Lu Xun. âNow that the ambush has been withdrawn, we can settle
them in about ten days.â
âThe proper time to attack was when they began to transfer their camp. Now
they are fully established with encampments stretching two hundred miles.
Having spent seven or eight months in strengthening where they might be
attacked, will it not be difficult to destroy them?â said they.
âI see you do not understand how to carry on war. This man Liu Bei is a
capable and crafty man. When he first started on this expedition his methods
were of the best, and he kept them so for a long time, so we have to avoid him.
When his troops are worn out and his thoughts cease to be clear, that will be
our day to attack.â
At last they agreed with their chief.
The general discoursed on war,
According to the book;
Right craftily the bait for whales
Was put upon the hook.
When kingdoms three were carved out,
Though famous men were many,
Lu Xun the hero of Wu
At least stands high as any.
Lu Xun had already had the plan whereby the Shu army was to be crushed, and at
this stage he wrote to the Prince of Wu in full details, even naming a day for
the victory.
âWe have found another remarkably able leader,â said the Prince, âand I
have no further anxiety. They all said he was a useless pedant, and only I knew
better. Reading this letter shows him nothing at all of a pedant.â
Then the Prince of Wu mustered the remainder of his soldiers to hold in
reserve.
Meanwhile the First Ruler had sent orders to hasten the marines down the river
and take up stations along the banks deep in the territory of Wu.
However, Huang Quan spoke against this, saying, âIt is easy enough for the
ships to go down, but how about returning? Let me make the first advance, and
Your Majesty may follow. That will make it more than probable that nothing will
go wrong.â
âThose Wu enemy are afraid,â objected the First Ruler, âand I want to
make a dash at them. Where is the difficulty?â
Though many others had spoken against the proposal, the First Ruler did not
give up the notion of going into the forefront of the attack. Then dividing the
army into two portions, he placed Huang Quan in command on the North of the
Great River, to keep a watch on Wei, while he commanded on the South of the
Great River. They made encampments and stations along the bank.
The spies of Wei duly reported these doings to the Ruler of Wei: âShu marches
against Wu, erecting forty base camps along two hundred miles of woods and
hills. Moreover, the Ruler of Shu places Huang Quan in command of the North of
the Great River. Huang Quanâs marines patrolled as far as thirty miles daily.
We do not know their intention.â
The Ruler of Wei laughed aloud when he heard the details of the long line of
camps and the encampments among the trees and all this.
âLiu Bei is going to be defeated,â said he.
âHow do you know?â asked his courtiers.
âBecause Liu Bei does not know how to wage war. How can he beat off an enemy
along a front of two hundred miles? The maxims of war forbid to camp in open
plains, among marshes, amid precipitous heights and obstacles. He will be
defeated at the hand of Lu Xun, and we shall hear of it in about ten days.â
His officers felt more than doubtful and entreated their master to prepare an
army to guard against Huang Quan, and to attack Shu if the occasion would
allow.
But the Ruler of Wei replied, âI do not plan to attack Shu. If successful, Lu
Xun will lead all his force westward into West River Land, and the South Land
will be defenseless. I shall pretend to send an army to help. I shall send them
in three divisions, and I shall overcome Wu easily.â
They all bowed acquiescence and approval. Then orders went out appointing Cao
Ren to lead an army out to Ruxu, Cao Xiu to take a second out to Dongkou, and
Cao Zhen to command a third aiming at Nanjun, and the three armies were to
combine on a given date for a sudden attack on Wu. The Ruler of Wei would
himself bring up the reinforcement in this southern campaign.
Having reached Chengdu, Ma Liang lost no time in seeing the Prime Minister and
presenting the plan of the armies as they were in the field.
Said Ma Liang, âNow the forces are on both sides of the Great River extending
along a front of two hundred miles, with forty stations, each beside a mountain
stream or in a pleasantly shaded forest. At our lordâs command, I prepared
this map, and he sent me to ask your opinion.â
âWho advised such an arrangement? He ought to be put to death, whoever it
was!â cried Zhuge Liang, tapping the table at his side.
âIt is entirely our lordâs own work. No other had any hand in it,â said
Ma Liang.
âThe life and energy of the Hans are done indeed,â said Zhuge Liang
sorrowfully. âOur lord has committed those very faults which the rules of the
Art of War lay down as to be particularly avoided. The camps are made where
free movement is impossible, and nothing can save him if the enemy use fire.
Beside, what defense is possible along a two-hundred-mile front? Disaster is at
hand, and Lu Xun sees it all, which explains his obstinate refusal to come out
into the open. Go back as quickly as you can, and tell our lord that this will
not do, that it must be changed at once.â
âBut if I am too late â-if Wu has already attacked and won â-, what
then?â
âThe enemy will not dare to follow up their victory by a march on Chengdu. So
this capital is secure.â
âWhy will they not?â
âWei is behind their back: That is why. Our lord will be compelled to shelter
in Baidicheng. I have already placed ten thousand troops in hiding at Fishbelly
Creek.â
âHave you? I have been up and down that creek three or four times without
seeing a soldier. I do not see the reason of telling lies to me,â said Ma
Liang.
âYou will see. Do not ask so many questions.â
With the precious instructions which he had persuaded Zhuge Liang to draw up,
Ma Liang hastened back to the imperial camp, while Zhuge Liang went to the
capital to prepare a relief expedition.
The soldiers of Shu had become slack and idle and no longer maintained adequate
defense, wherefore Lu Xun perceived that his moment had arrived, and called his
generals to his tent to receive orders.
âThere has been no fighting since I received our lordâs command. I have
spent the time in acquiring a knowledge of the enemy. As a preliminary
operation I want to capture a camp on the south bank. Who volunteers?â
Out stepped Han Dang and Zhou Tai and Ling Tong, all three at once, each crying
that he wanted to be sent. But they were sent back. The Commander-in-Chief did
not want any of them.
Then he called up the junior general, Chunyu Dan, and said, âYou will take
the fourth camp on the south side. The commander of that post is Fu Tong. You
may have five thousand troops. I shall support you.â
Chunyu Dan took the order and was gone.
Then Lu Xun summoned Xu Sheng and Ding Feng and said, âEach of you will take
three thousand troops and bivouac two miles from the camp, so that if Chunyu
Dan is repulsed and pursued, you can rescue him.â
Chunyu Dan marched between the lights and reached the camp he was to capture
just after the third watch. His drums rolled, and he attacked at once. The
defenders came out led by Fu Tong, who, spear ready to thrust, rode straight
toward the leader of the attack and forced him back. Suddenly there arose the
roll of other drums, and a cohort under Zhao Rong barred the way. Chunyu Dan
turned off along another road, escaping with loss of many troops.
But he was not yet safe. Some distance farther he ran against the Mang
tribesmen leader Shamo Ke. However, Chunyu Dan avoided him also and went on his
way, pursued now by three parties. Soon he reached the spot two miles from the
camp, and here the two leaders of Wu â-Xu Sheng and Ding Feng â-, who had
been placed ready to afford succor, came out and stopped the pursuit. When the
enemy had retired, Chunyu Dan was escorted back to camp.
He was wounded, and with the arrow still undrawn he appeared before Lu Xun and
apologized for his failure.
âIt was no fault of yours,â said the Commander-in-Chief. âI wanted to
test the force of our enemy. My plan of attack is quite ready.â
âThe enemy is very strong and will not be easily overcome,â said Xu Sheng
and Ding Feng. âWe have now suffered great loss to no purpose.â
âThis plan of mine would not hoodwink Zhuge Liang, but happily he is not
here. His absence will allow me to score a great success.â
Then he summoned his generals to receive orders: âZhu Ran is to lead the
marine force. He is to advance next day afternoon, when the southeast wind will
serve. His ships are laden with reeds and straw, which are to be used as
ordered. Han Dang is to attack the north bank, Zhou Tai the south. Each
soldier, in addition to his weapons, is to carry a bundle of straw or reeds,
with sulfur and saltpeter hidden therein, and each has a piece of tinder. They
are to advance, and, when they reach the Shu camps, they are to start a
conflagration. But they are to burn only alternate camps, twenty in all,
leaving the others untouched. They are to advance and pursue the enemy until
they capture Liu Bei.â
The leaders received the orders and so set out.
The First Ruler was in his own camp, pondering over a plan to destroy the
armies of Wu, when suddenly the staff that bore the great standard in front of
his own tent fell over and lay on the ground. There was no wind to account for
this, so he turned to Cheng Jin and asked what it might portend.
âIt means only one thing: The troops of Wu will raid the camp tonight,â
said Cheng Jin.
âThey will not dare after the slaughter of yesterday.â
âBut suppose that was only a reconnaissance. What then?â
Just then a report came in that some troops of Wu could be seen, very far off,
going along the hills eastward.
âThey are soldiers meant to put us in confusion,â said the First Ruler.
âTell the generals not to move, but let Guan Xing and Zhang Bao, with a small
mounted force, go out to reconnoiter.â
It was dusk when these two returned, and they then reported: âFire is seen
among the camps on the north bank.â
The Emperor hastily bade Guan Xing go to rescue the north camps and Zhang Bao
to the south to find out what was really happening. And they started.
About the middle of the first watch the wind got up and blew strong from the
east. Then fire arose from the camp on the left of the First Rulerâs own. He
was starting to extinguish this flame when another fire began in the camp on
his right. With the aid of the strong breeze both fires became fierce, and soon
the trees caught. A confused roar showed the gathering strength of the fire.
The soldiers of the burning camps were rushing into the First Rulerâs own
camp to escape the fire, and in their confusion they trampled on each other, so
that many died.
Behind them came the troops of Wu bent on slaughter. Ignorant of how many they
might be, the First Ruler mounted and dashed for Feng Xiâs camp, but that
also was in flames, which seemed to rise to the very sky. By this time flames
were rising from both sides of the river, so that everything was as visible as
by day.
Feng Xi leaped to his horse and fled, followed by a band of his mounted troops.
This small force ran against the soldiers of Wu under Xu Sheng. A melee ensued,
thereupon the First Ruler turned and galloped west. Xu Sheng then left Feng Xi
and went in pursuit. Presently the Emperor saw a party of soldiers in the way
and became greatly alarmed.
This was Ding Fengâs army, and the First Ruler was between two foes. In his
terror he saw no possibility of safety, no road was open. Just at this moment
another cohort broke through to his side and rescued him. The leader was Zhang
Bao, and he led the Imperial Guards, who fled, taking the First Ruler with
them. As they marched along, they fell in with another force of Shu; the leader
was Fu Tong, and he joined up with them. The Wu army was still following when
the fugitives reached Saddle Hill. The two leaders, Zhang Bao and Fu Tong, were
urging their lord to go to the top of this and out of immediate danger. Soon Lu
Xun arrived with his army and began to surround the hill. Zhang Bao and Fu Tong
held the road up the hill and kept the enemy from ascending. From the summit
could be seen flames all around, and the First Ruler witnessed the corpses of
his soldiers lay about in heaps or floated in the streams.
Next day, the soldiers of Wu set themselves to firing the hill. The First
Rulerâs remaining escort fled for their lives like rats, and their lord was
in despair. Suddenly he saw a general followed by a dozen horsemen cutting an
alley through and coming up the hill. As he drew nearer the Emperor recognized
Guan Xing.
Guan Xing quickly leapt down, prostrated himself and said, âYour Majesty, the
fire is gaining all round, and this place is not safe. I request you to try to
reach Baidicheng, and as many as possible will gather there.â
âWho will dare stay behind to keep off the enemy?â said the First Ruler.
Fu Tong volunteered, saying, âI will fight to death to guard the rear!â
It was dusk when they started. Guan Xing led the way, Zhang Bao protected the
First Ruler, and Fu Tong guarded the rear. They got their lord safely down the
hill and away. As soon as the troops of Wu noticed the flight, they pressed
forward, each anxious to gain kudos by the capture of the Emperorâs person.
Great armies of Wu, blotting out the sky and hiding the earth, went westward in
pursuit.
The First Ruler ordered his soldiers to make fires of their clothing and other
things in the road so as to hinder pursuit.
Zhu Ran marched up from the river to try to intercept the flight, and the noise
of his drums was terrifying.
The First Ruler thought there was no possibility of escape from this force, and
cried, âThis is the end!â
His two nephews dashed to the front to try to cut a way through, but returned
wounded and bleeding. And the noise of the pursuers came constantly nearer as
they found their way along the valleys. About the first glimpse of dawn the
case seemed quite desperate. But just at the worst they saw Zhu Ranâs
soldiers suddenly begin to break up and scatter, tumbling into streams and
rolling down precipices. Soon the reason was evident: A fearsome general
leading a cohort came to their relief.
Once again the First Ruler was rescued from pressing danger, and this time the
rescuer was Zhao Zilong. He had been in Jiangzhou, and news of the straits of
his lord had reached him there. He had set out forthwith. Then he had seen the
glow of the burnings and had marched toward it. And thus he had arrived just at
the moment to save his master when danger was most imminent.
As soon as Lu Xun heard that Zhao Zilong had appeared, he ordered his troops to
stop pursuit and retire. Zhao Zilong happening upon Zhu Ran, engaged him
forthwith and in the first encounter slew Zhu Ran with a spear thrust. And so
the army of Wu were dispersed and retired, and the First Ruler got safely to
the wall of Baidicheng.
But on the way thither his thoughts went back to his companions in misfortune,
and he inquired after them anxiously.
âThough I am safe, how about the other generals and soldiers?â asked the
First Ruler.
âThe pursuers are close upon us, and we cannot wait for anything,â said
Zhao Zilong. âI wish Your Majesty to get into the city as quickly as
possible. While you are reposing yourself, we may try to rescue some of the
leaders.â
When the First Ruler entered Baidicheng, he was in sore straits, only having
about a hundred men left.
A poet wrote concerning this victory of Lu Xun:
He grips the spear, he kindles fire, the camps are swept away;
Liu Bei to the White Emperor City flees, lonely and sad today.
But Lu Xunâs meteoric fame now shoots through Shu and Wei,
For bookish people the Prince of Wu has naught but good to say.
But Fu Tong, who commanded the rearguard, was surrounded by the enemy in all
eight directions.
Ding Feng shouted to him, âYou had better surrender! Many soldiers of Shu
have fallen, more have surrendered, and your lord is a prisoner. You have no
hope against us with your scanty force.â
But Fu Tong replied, âShall I, a servant of Han, give in to the curs of
Wu?â
Undaunted, he rode at his opponents and fought many bouts. But his strength and
valor availed naught. Struggle as he would, he could not make his way out. And
so he fell among his enemies.
A poem celebrates his valiancy:
Wu, at Yiling, strove with Shu,
Flames, not swords, used crafty Lu Xun.
Worthy of a place among Han generals
Is the hero named Fu Tong.
The Minister Cheng Jin, having got clear of the battle, rode swiftly to the
river bank and called to the marines to join in the battle. They landed, but
were soon scattered.
One of Cheng Jinâs generals shouted to him: âThe soldiers of Wu are upon
us. Let us find a way to escape, Libationer Cheng Jin!â
But Cheng Jin shouted back, âSince I first followed my lord, I have never yet
turned my back upon the foe!â
The enemy surrounded Cheng Jin, and, as he could do no more, he took his sword
and slew himself.
Noble among the warriors of Shu was Cheng Jin,
He kept his sword for the service of his prince.
When danger pressed near he wavered not,
Wherefore his fame remains forever bright.
Now Hu Ban and Zhang Nan had been besieging Yiling. Then came Feng Xi and told
of the need of their lord, and they led off their army to rescue him. Whereupon
Sun Huan was set free as Lu Xun had foretold would happen.
As soon as Sun Huan was free, he set off in pursuit of Hu Ban, Zhang Nan, and
Feng Xi. These two marched until they met an army of Wu face to face, and so
were between two forces. A desperate battle was fought, and both Zhang Nan and
Feng Xi perished therein.
Feng Xi was loyal without peer;
Zhang Nan was righteous, few have equaled him.
In battle on the flaming shore they died,
And the histories record their deeds.
Hu Ban broke through. He was pursued, but he luckily fell in with Zhao Zilong
and got safely to Baidicheng.
The Mang tribesmen King Shamo Ke was flying from the battle field when he met
Zhou Tai, who slew him after a short fight.
The two Shu generals Du Lu and Liu Ning surrendered to Wu, as did many
soldiers. Of the stores and weapons in the camps of Shu nothing was saved.
When the story of the disaster to Shu reached the South Land, and with it the
report that the First Ruler had been killed in battle, Lady Sun gave way to
wild grief. She rode down to the river bank and, gazing westward, wept and
lamented. Then she threw herself into the stream and was drowned. Posterity
erected a temple on the shore called âThe Shrine of the Bold Beautyâ, and
one who described it wrote a poem:
The Ruler, defeated, fled to Baidicheng,
Through thunderous tiding, Lady Sun committed suicide.
Today the water still flows by the carved stone
To show where and why this heroine died.
There could be no question that this exploit brought tremendous glory to Lu
Xun. Anxious to push his advantage as far as possible, Lu Xun led his exultant
army westward. But as he drew near to Kui Pass, he suddenly pulled up his
horse, remarking that he saw an aura of death about the mountain side in front.
âWe may not yet advance farther. I suspect an ambush.â
So they retreated three miles and camped in a wide open space. And the army was
arrayed ready against any sudden attack. Meanwhile, scouts were sent out. They
returned reporting no soldiers. Lu Xun doubted and went up to the summit of a
hill whence he could see over the country. The aura was still visible to him,
and so he dispatched other people to spy. But he received the same report: Not
a soldier, not a horse.
Still, as the sun got lower and lower in the west, he saw the same appearance
accentuated, and he began to feel grave doubts. He sent a confidant to look
once more.
This man came back, saying, âThere is not a single soldier, but I have
noticed on the river bank nearly a hundred heaps of boulders.â
The Commander-in-Chief, still doubting, called in several of the natives and
questioned them about the stones.
âWho put them there? Why did they look so ghastly?â asked Lu Xun.
âWe do not know. This place is called Fishbelly Creek. When Zhuge Liang was
going west into the River Lands, he came along here with a lot of soldiers and
heaped up the boulders like that on the sandy beach. We have seen vapors rising
from the boulders; they seemed to come from inside them.â
Lu Xun decided to go and look at these boulders himself. So he rode off, with a
small escort. Looked down from a declivity, the stones were evidently arranged
with a design related to the eight points of the compass. There were doors and
door-sills and lintels.
âThis looks likely to drive a person out of his senses,â he said. âI
wonder whether it is any good.â
They rode down with intent to examine the mysterious arrangement more closely
and went in among the stones.
Presently one of the escort called attention to the increasing darkness and
said, âThe sun is setting. We ought to be returning to camp.â
But as Lu Xun glanced round to look for an exit, a sudden squall came on and
the dust whirled up, obscuring both sky and earth. And in the swirl the stones
reared themselves up like steep mountains, pointed like swords, and the dust
and sand shaped themselves into waves and hillocks one behind the other. The
roar of the boiling river was as the drums before a battle.
âThis is some trick of Zhuge Liang,â said Lu Xun in a scared voice, âand
I have been caught.â
He would go out, but he had quite lost his way and could find no exit. As he
stopped to consider what he should do, an old man suddenly appeared.
The old man said, âDoes the General wish to go out?â
âI greatly desire that you would pilot me out, O Elder!â replied he.
Leaning on his staff, the old man led the way and with quiet dignity conducted
Lu Xun outside. He had no difficulty in finding his way and paused not a single
instant. When they were once again on the slope, Lu Xun asked his aged guide
who he was.
âI am Zhuge Liangâs father-in-law. My name is Huang Chenyan. My son-in-law
placed these boulders here as you see them, and he said they represented the
Eight-Array Maze. They are like eight doors, and according to the scheme are
named: Gate of Rest, Gate of Life, Gate of Injury, Gate of Obstruction, Gate of
Prospect, Gate of Death, Gate of Surprise, and Gate of Openings.
âThey are capable of infinite mutations and would be equal to a hundred
thousand soldiers. As he was leaving, he told me that if any leader of Wu
became mazed in them, I was not to conduct him outside. From a precipice near
by I saw you, General, enter in at the Gate of Death. As I guessed you were
ignorant of the scheme, I knew you would be entangled. But I am of a good
disposition and could not bear that you should be entrapped without possibility
of escape, so I came to guide you to the Gate of Life.â
âHave you studied this matter, Sir?â asked Lu Xun.
âThe variations are inexhaustible, and I could not learn them all.â
Lu Xun dismounted, bowed low before the old man and then rode away.
The famous poet Du Fu wrote some verses which run something like this:
Planner of three kingdoms, no small praise
Is his â-Inventor of the Eight Arrays.
And for that famous boulders, on the riverâs brim,
Firm was set the denouncement of Wuâs whim.
Lu Xun took his way to his camp in deep thought.
âThis Zhuge Liang is well named Sleeping Dragon,â said he. âI am not his
equal.â
Then, to the amazement of all, Lu Xun gave orders to retire. The officers
ventured to remonstrate, seeing that they had been so successful.
âGeneral, you have utterly broken the enemy, and Liu Bei is shut up in one
small city. It seems the time to smite, and yet you retire because you have
come across a mysterious arrangement of stones.â
âI am not afraid of the stones, and it is not on their account that I retire.
But I fear Cao Pi. He is no less resourceful than his father, and when he hears
I am marching into Shu, he will certainly attack us. How could I return
then?â
The homeward march began.
On the second day the scouts brought a report: âThree Wei generals with three
armies are debouching at three different points and moving toward the borders
of Wu â-Cao Ren to Ruxu, Cao Xiu to Dongkou, and Cao Zhen to Nanjun. Their
intentions are unclear.â
âJust as I thought,â said Lu Xun. âBut I am ready for them.â
âAnd now the west is mine,â the victor thought,
But danger from the north discretion taught.
The story of the retreat will be told in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 85 ****
In summer, the sixth month of the second year of Manifest Might (AD 221) Lu Xun
destroyed the army of Shu at Yiling. The First Ruler sought refuge in
Baidicheng, of which Zhao Zilong then undertook the defense. When Ma Liang
returned only to find his lord defeated, he was more distressed than he could
say. He announced what Zhuge Liang had said concerning the plans.
The First Ruler sighed, saying, âIf I had listened to the Prime Ministerâs
advice, the defeat would not have happened. Now how can I face the officials if
I return to my capital?â
So he promulgated a command to change the guest-house into the Palace of
Eternal Peace. He was deeply grieved when they told him Feng Xi, Cheng Jin, Fu
Tong, Zhang Nan, King Shamo Ke, and many of his generals had died loyally in
his cause.
Next he heard people say: âHuang Quan, who had been given command of the army
on the north bank, had given in to Wei. Your Majesty should deliver his whole
family to the authority and hold them responsible for the renegade.â
But the First Ruler only said, âThe army was quite cut off by Wu from the
south bank, and he had no alternative but to surrender. Really, I betrayed him,
not he me. Why should I take vengeance on his family?â
So he continued the issue of the renegadeâs pay to his family.
When Huang Quan surrendered, he was led into the presence of the Ruler of Wei.
Cao Pi said, âYou have surrendered to me because you desired to imitate the
admirable conduct of Chen Ping and Han Xin of old.â
But Huang Quan replied, weeping, âThe Ruler of Shu has been very kind to me,
and he gave me the leadership of the army on the North of the Great River. Lu
Xun cut me off so that I could not return to Shu, and I would not surrender to
Wu, wherefore I have yielded to Your Majesty. Defeated as I am, I should be
only too happy if my life were spared, but I have no claim to the credit of the
virtuous ones of old.â
The reply satisfied the Ruler of Wei, and he conferred on him the title General
Who Guards the South. But Huang Quan, however, declined the offer.
Then one of the courtiers said, âA spy has reported that all of your family
have been put to death by the Ruler of Shu.â
But the leader replied that he could not believe it.
âThe Ruler of Shu and his officials trust each other. He knows my heart, and
he would not injure my family.â
And the Ruler of Wei agreed with his opinion.
A poem has been written upbraiding Huang Quan:
That was a pity that Huang Quan grudged to die;
Though he yielded to Wei, not Wu,
Yet he crooked the knee in an alien court.
Which the loyal cannot do.
Cao Pi sought advice from Jia Xu concerning his design of bringing the whole
country under his own rule.
âI wish to bring the whole empire under my rule. Which shall I first reduce,
Shu or Wu?â
âLiu Bei is an able warrior, and Zhuge Liang is a most capable administrator.
Sun Quan possesses discrimination, and his general, Lu Xun, occupies all the
strategic positions of importance; the natural obstacles, the intervening
rivers and spreading lakes, would be hard to overcome. I do not think you have
any leader to match either of these two men. Even with the prestige of Your
Majestyâs own presence, no one could guarantee the result. The better course
is to hold on and await the outcome of the struggle between those two.â
âI have already dispatched three armies against Wu. Can it be that they will
fail?â
The Chair of the Secretariat, Liu Ye, held the same opinion as his colleague.
Said he, âLu Xun has just won a great victory over the Shu force of seven
hundred thousand, and all his army is full of confidence. Further, there are
the lakes and the rivers, which are natural difficulties hard to cope with. And
again, Lu Xun is resourceful and well prepared.â
The Ruler of Wei said, âFormerly, Sir, you urged me to attack Wu. Why do you
now give contrary advice?â
âBecause times have changed. When Wu was suffering defeat after defeat, the
country was depressed and might be smitten. Now this great victory has changed
all that, and their morale has increased a hundred times. I say now they may
not be attacked.â
âWell, but I have decided to attack. So say no more,â said the Ruler of
Wei.
He then led the Imperial Guards out to support his three armies.
But the scouts soon brought news justifying the opinion of his advisers: âA
force of Wu has been sent to oppose each of our three armies. Lu Fan leads an
army against Cao Xiu at Dongkou, Zhuge Jin against Cao Zhen at Nanjun, and Zhu
Huan against Cao Ren at Ruxu.â
Liu Ye pointed this out and again said, âWu has prepared, and no success can
be expected.â
Still Cao Pi was obstinate, and marched.
The Wu leader, Zhu Huan, who had been sent against Cao Ren at Ruxu, was a young
man of twenty-seven. He was bold and resourceful, and Sun Quan held him in
great regard. Hearing that Cao Ren was going to attack Xianxi, Zhu Huan led the
bulk of his troops to defend it, leaving only five thousand troops in Ruxu.
Then he heard that the van of the enemy, fifty thousand under General Chang
Diao, with the aid of Zhuge Qian and Wang Shuang, had made a dash for Ruxu, so
he hastened back and found the officers were in great fear.
Drawing his sword, he made a speech, âSuccess depends upon the leader rather
than on the number of soldiers. The Art of War says that the value of one
soldier who inhabits the place equals that of two soldiers who come from afar;
and those who are hosts, however in small number, can overcome those who are
guests. Now the enemy is weary from a long march, and I and you, my men, can
hold this place together. We have the Great River to defend us on the south,
and we are backed by the mountains on the north. Success should be ours easily,
and we are as hosts at home awaiting the arrival of our weary visitors. This
will give us victory in every fight. Even if Cao Pi comes, we need feel no
anxiety. How much less care we for Cao Ren and his troops?â
Zhu Huan he issued orders to furl all the banners and to silence all the drums
as if the city was empty of defenders.
In time, Chang Diao and his veterans of the van came to the city. Not a person
was visible, and he hastened forward with all speed. But as he neared the city,
suddenly a bomb went off. Immediately up rose a forest of flags, and out dashed
Zhu Huan with his sword drawn. And he made for Chang Diao. In the third
encounter Zhu Huan cut down Chang Diao, and the troops of Wu, rushing to the
attack, thoroughly routed the invaders, slaying innumerable soldiers. Beside
scoring a complete victory, Zhu Huan took much spoil of flags and weapons and
horses.
Cao Ren himself, coming up later, was attacked by the troops from Xianxi and
was also routed. He fled home to his master with the news of defeat and
destruction.
And before the Ruler of Wei could decide what course to take in regard to this
loss, the news came of the defeat of his another army: âCao Zhen and Xiahou
Shang were besieging Nanjun when Zhuge Jin from within and Lu Xun from without
attacked in concert. The two generals suffered a great loss.â
Immediately, another report came: âCao Xiu has been defeated by Lu Fan at
Dongkou.â
So all three armies had failed and were lost.
Cao Pi sighed and said sadly, âThis has come from my willfulness, and my
neglect of the advice of Jia Xu and Liu Ye.â
The summer of that year was very unhealthy, and a pestilence swept away the
soldiers more than half the number. So they were marched home to Capital
Luoyang. The two countries were at enmity though they were not fighting.
Meanwhile the First Ruler was failing. He remained in his Palace of Eternal
Peace at Baidicheng and presently was confined to his couch. Gradually he
became worse, and in the fourth moon of the third year of Manifest Might (AD
222) his condition became serious. He himself felt the end was near, and he was
depressed and wept for his two lost brothers till the sight of his eyes
suffered. He was morose and ill-tempered: He could not bear any of his court
near him, drove away his servants and lay upon his couch sad and solitary.
One evening as thus he lay, a sudden gust of wind came into the chamber, almost
extinguishing the candles. As they burned bright again, he saw two men standing
in the shade behind them.
âI told you I was worried,â said the First Ruler, âand bade you leave me.
Why have you come back? Go!â
But they remained and did not go. Wherefore the First Ruler rose and went over
to look at them. As he drew near he saw one was Guan Yu and the other Zhang
Fei.
âAre you still alive, then, brothers?â said he.
âWe are not men; we are shades,â said Guan Yu. âThe Supreme One has
conferred spirithood upon us in consideration of our faithfulness throughout
life, and ere long, brother, we three shall be together again.â
The First Ruler clutched at the figures and burst into tears; then he awoke.
The two figures were no longer there. He called in his people and asked the
hour. They told him the third watch.
âI am not much longer for this world,â said he with a sigh.
Messengers were sent to Capital Chengdu to summon the Prime Minister and other
high officers of state to receive the Emperorâs last instructions. They came,
Zhuge Liang bringing the two younger sons, Prince of Lu Liu Yung and Prince of
Liang Liu Li. The eldest, the heir-apparent, was left in charge of the capital.
Zhuge Liang saw at once that his master was very ill. He bowed to the ground at
the foot of the Dragon Couch.
The dying Emperor bade him come near and sit beside him, and he patted his
Minister on the back, saying, âThe attainment of emperorship was your work.
Little thought you that I should prove so stupid as not to follow your advice
and so bring about the late disasters. But I am deeply sorry, and now I shall
not live long. My heir is a degenerate, but I must leave him to do the best he
can with the great inheritance.â
And the tears flowed in streams.
âI trust Your Majesty will fulfill the hopes of the people by a speedy
recovery,â said Zhuge Liang, also in tears.
Turning his head, the First Ruler saw Ma Su, Ma Liangâs brother, at the
bedside. He bade him retire.
When Ma Su had left the chamber, the First Ruler said, âDo you think Ma Su is
clever?â
âHe is one of the ablest people in the empire,â said Zhuge Liang.
âI do not think so. I think his words exceed his deeds. Do not make much use
of him. Watch him carefully.â
Having said this, he bade them summon the high officers of state to the
chamber. Taking paper and pen, the First Ruler wrote his testament.
He handed it to the Prime Minister with a sigh and said, âI am no great
scholar, and I only know the rough outlines of what should be known. But the
Teacher has said: âA birdâs song is sad when death is near, and a dying
personâs words are good.â I was waiting that we might aid each other in the
destruction of the Caos and the restoration of the Hans, but ere the work is
complete I am called away, and this last command of mine I confide to you as
Prime Minister to be handed to my son and heir, Liu Shan. My words are to be
taken seriously. I trust that you will instruct and guide my son.â
Zhuge Liang and all those present wept and prostrated themselves, saying, âWe
pray Your Majesty repose yourself. We will do our utmost whereby to prove our
gratitude for the kindness we have received.â
At the First Rulerâs command the attendants raised Zhuge Liang from the
earth. With one hand the dying man brushed away the falling tears, while with
the other he grasped Zhuge Liangâs hand.
And he said, âThe end is near. I have something more to say as to a close
general.â
âWhat holy command has Your Majesty to give?â said Zhuge Liang.
The First Ruler said, âYou are many times more clever than Cao Pi, and you
must safeguard the kingdom and complete the great work. If my son can be
helped, help him. But if he proves a fool, then take the throne yourself and be
a ruler.â
Such a speech almost startled Zhuge Liang out of his senses. A cold sweat broke
out all over his body, and his limbs threatened to cease to support him.
He fell on his knees, saying, âI could never do otherwise than wear myself to
the bone in the service of your son, whom I will serve till death.â
He knocked his head upon the ground till blood ran down.
The dying man called Zhuge Liang closer, and at the same time making his two
sons come near, he said to them, âMy sons, remember your fatherâs words.
After my death you are to treat the Prime Minister as you would your father and
be not remiss, for thereby you will fulfill your fatherâs hopes.â
He made the two Princes pay to Zhuge Liang the obeisance due to a father.
Said Zhuge Liang, âWere I destroyed and ground into the earth, I should be
unable to repay the kindness I have experienced.â
Turning to the assembled officers, the First Ruler said, âAs you have seen, I
have confided my orphan son to the care of the Prime Minister and bidden my
sons treat him as a father. You too, Sirs, are to treat him with deference.
This is my dying request and charge to you.â
Turning to Zhao Zilong, he said, âYou and I have gone together through many
dangers and difficulties. Now comes the parting of our ways. You will not
forget our old friendship, and you must see to it that my sons follow my
precepts.â
âI shall never dare to give other than my best,â said Zhao Zilong. âThe
fidelity of the dog and horse is mine to give and shall be theirs.â
Then the First Ruler turned to the others, âNoble Sirs, I am unable to speak
to you one by one and lay a charge upon each individual. But I say to you:
Maintain your self-respect.â
These were his last words. He was sixty-three, and he died on the twenty-fourth
day of the fourth month (AD 222). A poem was written by Du Fu on his death:
The Emperor set out to destroy the land that lay through the Three Gorges,
Failed he and breathed his last in the Palace of Eternal Peace,
The Palace fair of his thoughts lay not this side the highlands.
Beautiful chambers are vainly sought in his rural temple,
Now are the pines near his shrine nesting places for herons,
Through the courts aged peasants saunter, enjoying their leisure,
Nearby often is found a shrine to this famous strategist,
Prince and ministerâs needs are now but offerings in season.
Thus died the First Ruler. All present lifted up their voices and wept.
The Prime Minister led the procession that escorted the coffin to the capital,
and the heir, Liu Shan, came to the outskirts of the city, as a dutiful son
should, to receive the remains with due respect. The coffin was laid in the
Great Hall of the Palace, wherein they lamented and performed the ceremonies
appointed. At the end of these the testament was opened and read:
âI first fell ill from a simple ailment. Other disorders followed, and it
became evident that I should not recover.
âThey say that death at fifty cannot be called premature. As I have passed
sixty, I may not resent the call. But when I think of you and your brothers, I
regret. Now I say to you, strive and strive again. Do not do evil because it is
a small evil; do not leave undone a small good because it is a small good. Only
with wisdom and virtue people can be won. But your fatherâs virtue was but
slender, and do not imitate.
âAfter my death you are to conduct the affairs of the state with the Prime
Minister. You are to treat him as a father and serve him without remissness.
You and your brothers are to seek instructions. This is my final and simple
command.â
When the officials had read this, Zhuge Liang said, âThe state cannot go a
single day without a ruler, wherefore I beg you to install the heir as
successor to the great line of Han.â
Thereupon the ceremony was performed, and the new Emperor took his place. The
style of the reign was changed to âBeginning Prosperityâ. Zhuge Liang was
made Lord of Wuxiang and Imperial Protector of Yizhou.
Then they buried the late Emperor at Huiling with the posthumous style of Liu
Bei the Glorious Emperor.
The Empress, of the Wu family, was formally created Empress Dowager. The late
Consort Gan became the Glorious Empress, and the Lady Mi was granted similar,
also posthumous, rank. There were promotions in rank and rewards for all, and a
general amnesty was proclaimed.
Before long, knowledge of these things came to the Middle Land, and a report
was sent to Capital Luoyang and made known to the Ruler of Wei.
Cao Pi felt relieved and was glad of the death of his rival, saying, âLiu Bei
is dead: I am no longer worried. An attack during the critical moment can bring
a victory over Shu.â
But Jia Xu dissuaded him, saying, âLiu Bei is gone, but surely he has
confided the care of the state to Zhuge Liang, who is indebted to him so
deeply. He will exhaust every effort to support his young lord. You may not
hastily attack.â
As Jia Xu tendered this remonstrance, a man suddenly stepped out from the
serried ranks of courtiers and said fiercely, âIf you neglect this moment,
can you expect a more favorable opportunity?â
All eyes turned to the speaker. It was Sima Yi.
The interruption greatly pleased Cao Pi, who at once asked how it was to be
done.
Sima Yi propounded his plan in the following speech: âIt would be very
difficult to obtain success with our own resources. Hence we must use five
armies and attack all round at the same time, so as to divide Zhuge Liang.â
âWhere are the five armies to come from?â said Cao Pi.
Sima Yi went on, âThe first is to be got from Liaodong, from the Xianbi
State. You must write to King Kebi Neng and send him presents of gold and silks
so that he may send one hundred thousand Qiang troops from Liaoxi to attack
Xiping Pass. Secondly, the king of the Mang Tribes, Meng Huo, must be persuaded
to lead one hundred thousand troops to attack the south of Shu â-Yizhou,
Yongchang, Zangge, and Yuesui. Thirdly, you must send an ambassador to Wu with
fair promises of an increase of territory, and so induce Sun Quan to march one
hundred thousand troops to the attack of the Three Gorges, making Fucheng his
objective. The fourth army can be got from General Meng Da in Shangyong, who
can muster one hundred thousand troops to attack Hanzhong. Lastly, our own
force of one hundred thousand troops may be placed under Cao Zhen, who will
attack by way of Yangping Pass. With five hundred thousand troops making
simultaneous attacks along five different directions, it would be hard for
Zhuge Liang to hold his own, even if he had the talent of Lu Wang himself.â
The scheme delighted Cao Pi, who at once cast about for four glib-tongued
messengers. He also issued a commission to Cao Zhen as Commander-in-Chief with
the order to take Yangping Pass.
At this time Zhang Liao and most others of the veterans who had served Cao Cao
were keeping watch in various stations and passes and fords in Jizhou, Xuzhou,
Qingzhou, and Hefei. They were not summoned for this expedition to the west.
After the accession of Liu Shan, the Latter Ruler, many of those who had served
his father gradually died after the decease of their master. The work of the
administration of the country, the choice of officials, law-making, taxation,
decision of legal cases, was all done by the Prime Minister.
As the Latter Ruler had no consort, the courtiers, headed by Zhuge Liang,
proposed, saying, âThe daughter of the late General of the Flying Cavalry
Zhang Fei is prudent, and she is now seventeen. Your Majesty should make her
Empress.â
So Lady Zhang was married to the Emperor and became Empress Zhang.
It was in the autumn of the first year of Beginning Prosperity (AD 223) that
the Latter Ruler heard of the plans and intentions of Wei against his state.
The persons who told him gave him full details said: ï¿½Wei has mustered five
armies of one hundred thousand each to march against the River Lands. The first
army led by Commander-in-Chief Cao Zhen is heading to Yangping Pass. The second
army from Shangyong led by the rebel Meng Da is planning to attack Hanzhong.
The third army from Wu is threatening the Three Gorges. The fourth army under
King Kebi Neng of the Qiang tribes is marching to Xiping Pass. And the fifth
army by Meng Huo of the Mang nations is approaching the southern border near
Yizhou, Yongchang, Zangge, and Yuesui. The border stations have sent flying
requests for help. We have informed the Prime Minister. But his conduct puzzles
us. We do not know why he does not take some action instead of remaining shut
up in his palace all the time.â
The Latter Ruler became really alarmed, and he sent one of his personal
attendants to call the Prime Minister to court.
The servant was gone a long time, and then returned to say: âThe servants in
the residence said the Prime Minister was ill and not to be seen.â
The young Emperorâs distress increased, and he sent two High Ministers â-
Dong Yun and Du Qiong â-to Zhuge Liang, saying they were to see him even if
he was on his couch and tell him the dreadful news of invasion. They went; but
they got no farther than the gate. The keepers of the gate refused them
admission.
But Du Qiong said, ï¿½The First Ruler had confided his son to the Prime
Minister. It has not been long since His Majestyâs accession to the Throne
that Cao Pi threatens to invade our territories with five armies. This is
urgent military matter. How can the Prime Minister make illness as an excuse
not to appear?ï¿½
The wardens of the gate went inside with what was said.
After keeping them waiting a long time, the wardens returned, saying, âThe
Prime Minister is rather better and will be at court in the morning.â
The two ministers sighed deeply as they wended their way to the Emperorâs
palace.
Next morning a great crowd of officers assembled at the gate of the Prime
Ministerâs residence to wait for him to appear. But he did not come out. It
began to grow late, and many of them were tired of waiting, and the crowd
dispersed.
Du Qiong went again to the Emperor and suggested, saying, âYour Majesty
should go in person and try to get Zhuge Liang to say what should be done.â
The Latter Ruler then returned to his palace with the officials and told the
Empress Dowager his trouble. She was also alarmed.
âWhat can he mean?â said she. âThis does not look like acting in the
spirit of the charge laid upon him by the late Emperor. Let me go myself.â
âOh no,â said Dong Yun. âYour Majesty must not go. We think all is well,
and the Prime Minister certainly understands and will do something. Beside, you
must let His Majesty go first, and if the Prime Minister still shows
remissness, then Your Majesty can summon him to the Temple of the Dynasty and
ask him.â
So it was left at that. And the next day the Emperor rode in his chariot to the
gate of his minister. When the doorkeepers saw the imperial chariot appear,
they fell upon their knees to welcome the Emperor.
âWhere is the Prime Minister?â asked he.
âWe do not know. But we have orders not to let in the crowd of officers.â
The Emperor then descended and went on foot right in to the third gate. Then he
saw Zhuge Liang leaning on a staff beside a fishpond looking at the fish. The
Latter Ruler approached, and stood behind him for a long time.
Presently the Latter Ruler said slowly and with dignity, âIs the Prime
Minister really enjoying himself?â
Zhuge Liang started and looked round. When he saw who the speaker was, he
suddenly dropped his staff and prostrated himself.
âI ought to be put to death ten thousand times!â said Zhuge Liang.
But the Emperor put forth his hand and helped him to rise, saying, âCao Pi
threatens immediate invasion from five points. Why will you not come forth and
attend to business?â
Zhuge Liang laughed. He conducted the Emperor into an inner room, and, when he
was seated, Zhuge Liang addressed the Emperor, saying, âCould it be possible
that I was ignorant of these five armies? I was not looking at the fishes; I
was thinking.â
âBut, this being so, what shall we do?â
âI have already turned back that Kebi Neng of the Qiangs, and Meng Huo of the
Mangs, and the rebel leader Meng Da, and the army from Wei. I have also thought
out a plan to circumvent the army from Wu, but I need a special sort of person
to carry it out. I want an envoy, an able talker, one capable of persuading
other people. It was because I have not found such a person yet that I was so
deeply in thought. But Your Majesty may set your mind at rest and not be
anxious.â
The Latter Ruler heard this half terrified and half glad.
âSurely your superhuman devices are too deep for the mortal. But may I ask
how these armies have been made to turn back?â
âSince His Late Majesty bade me take the best care of your welfare, I dare
not be remiss for a single moment. Some officers in Chengdu are ignorant of
that refinement of war which consists in not allowing the enemy to guess your
plans. How could I let them know anything? When I heard that Kebi Neng, the
king of Qiangs, might invade, I remembered that Ma Chaoâs forefathers were
friendly with those tribespeople and they had a high opinion of Ma Chao,
calling him General Who Possesses Heavenly Prestige. So I sent orders by
dispatch to Ma Chao to hold the Xiping Pass, and to prepare ambushes in certain
places and change them daily so as to keep the Qiangs off. That settled them.
âI sent hastily to the south to order Wei Yan to move certain bodies of
troops about through the southwest territories, to be seen and then to
disappear, to go in and come out, and to march to and fro, so that the Mangs
should be perplexed. The Mangs are brave, but prone to doubts and hesitations,
and they would not advance in the face of the unknown. Hence there is nothing
to fear in that quarter.
âI also knew that Meng Da and our Li Yan were sworn friends. I had left Li
Yan in charge of the Palace of Eternal Peace. I sent Li Yan a letter and urged
him to write to Meng Da, so that Meng Da would feign illness and not move his
army.
âI sent Zhao Zilong to occupy Yangping Pass and all the strategic positions
on the way by which Cao Zhen would march, and bade him defend only and not go
to the battle. If our troops refuse to come out, Cao Zhen will certainly have
to retire. So all those four are settled. But for greater security I have sent
Zhang Bao and Guan Xing each with thirty thousand troops to camp at points
whence they can quickly help any of the others who may need it. And none of
these arrangements are known here.
âNow there is only Wu left to deal with. Had the other four armies succeeded
and Shu been in danger, Sun Quan would have come to the attack. If the others
fail, I know he will not budge, for he will remember that Cao Pi has just sent
three armies to attack his country. And this being so, I want someone with a
ready tongue and ingenious mind to go and talk plainly to Sun Quan. So far I
have not found such a person, and I am perplexed. I regret that I have given
Your Majesty occasion to make this journey.â
âThe Empress Dowager also wanted to come,â said the Emperor. âBut now you
have spoken, O Minister Father, I am as one awakened from a dream. I shall
grieve no more.â
They two drank a few cups of wine together, and the Prime Minister escorted his
master to his chariot. A ring of courtiers were waiting, and they could not
help remarking the happiness that shone in their masterâs face. The Latter
Ruler took his leave and returned to his palace, but the courtiers did not know
what to think.
Now Zhuge Liang had noted a certain man among the crowd who smiled and looked
quite happy. Zhuge Liang looked at him intently and then recollected his name,
which was Deng Zhi of Xinye, a descendant of Commander Deng Yu of Han. Deng Zhi
was currently the Chair of the Census Board. Zhuge Liang sent a man privately
to detain Deng Zhi, and when all the others had gone, Zhuge Liang led him into
the library for a chat. Presently he came to the matter near his heart.
âThe three states have become a fact,â said Zhuge Liang. âNow if our
state wanted to absorb the other two and restore the condition of one rule,
which country should it attack first?â
âThough Wei is the real rebel, yet Wei is strong and would be very difficult
to overthrow. Any move against it would have to develop slowly. As our Emperor
has but lately succeeded his father and the people are none too decided in his
favor, I should propose a treaty of mutual defense with Wu. This would
obliterate the enmity of His Late Majesty and would have important results.
However, you, Sir, may have another opinion. What is it?â
âThat is what I have been thinking of this long time, but I had not the
person for the task. Now I have found him.â
âWhat do you want the person to do?â said Deng Zhi.
âI want him to go as envoy to Wu to negotiate such a treaty. As you
understand the position so well, you will surely do honor to your princeâs
commission as envoy. There is no other who would succeed.â
âI fear I am not equal to such a task: I am not clever enough and too
ignorant.â
âI will inform the Emperor tomorrow and beg him to appoint you. Of course you
will accept.â
Deng Zhi consented and then took his leave. As promised, Zhuge Liang
memorialized, and the Latter Ruler consented that the mission should be
entrusted to Deng Zhi. And he started.
The din of war will cease in Wu,
When Shuâs desires are known.
For the success or failure of this mission read the next chapter.

title General Who Upholds the State, was ennobled as Lord of Jiangling, and
received the Governorship of Jingzhou. He became Supreme Commander of all the
military forces.
Zhang Zhao and Gu Yong, thinking the moment opportune for enhancing their
lordâs dignity, sent in a memorial proposing that his rule should be
designated by a distinctive style, and Sun Quan assumed ï¿½Yellow Might Eraï¿½
as his reign style (AD 222).
Then arrived a messenger from Wei, and he was called in to an assembly and
bidden to state his business.
The messenger said, âRecently Shu sent to Wei for help, and, the situation
being misunderstood, the Ruler of Wei dispatched a force against Wu. Now this
action is greatly regretted. In Wei it is thought desirable to set four armies
in motion against Shu to capture it. Now if Wu will assist, and success crowns
these efforts, Wei and Wu will share the conquered territory.â
Sun Quan listened, but was not prepared to give a decided answer. He betook
himself to his counselors, Zhang Zhao and Gu Yong.
They said, âLu Xun is the man of profound knowledge. He should be
consulted.â
So Lu Xun was called, and his speech ran thus: âCao Pi is too firmly
established in the Middle Land to be upset now; and if this offer of his be
refused, we shall provoke his enmity. Neither Wei nor Wu, so far as I see, has
anyone fit to oppose Zhuge Liang. We must perforce consent and put our army in
order. But we can wait till we see how the four armies speed. If Shu seems
likely to fall and Zhuge Liang is outmaneuvered, then our army can be
dispatched and we will take Capital Chengdu. If the four armies fail, we shall
have to consider.â
So Sun Quan said to the envoy of Wei, âWe are not ready at the moment, so we
will choose a day to start later.â
And with this answer the envoy left.
Next they made careful inquiries about the success or failure of the four
armies against Shu.
The spies reported: âThe western Qiangs under King Kebi Neng have turned back
when they saw Ma Chao in command at Xiping Pass. The southern Mangs led by Meng
Huo have been perplexed at the tactics of Wei Yan and have retreated to their
territories. The Shangyong leader, Meng Da, have set out, but half way have
fallen ill and gone back. And Cao Zhenâs army, while marching toward Yangping
Pass, have been brought to a halt by the defensive preparations of Zhao Zilong,
who has garrisoned every pass and occupied every point of vantage; they have
eventually retreated, after being camped in the Xie Valley for some time.â
Knowing all this, Sun Quan said to his officials, âLu Xunâs words were
indeed prophetic; he made most perfect deductions. Any rash action on my part
would place me on bad terms with Shu.â
Just then the coming of an envoy from Shu was announced.
Said Zhang Zhao, âThis mission is also part of Zhuge Liangâs scheme to
divert danger from Shu. Deng Zhi has come as envoy.â
âThat being so, how should I reply?â asked Sun Quan.
âI will tell you. Set up a large cauldron and pour therein a quantity of oil.
Light a fire beneath. When the oil is boiling, choose a goodly company of your
tallest and brawniest fighting guards, arm them and draw them up in lines
between the Palace gate and your throne room. Then summon Deng Zhi. But before
he can say a word, forewarn him that he will have the same fate of being boiled
in oil if being guilty of the same sort of treachery as Li Yiji when he was a
persuader to the state of Qi. Then see what Deng Zhi will say.â
Sun Quan followed this advice, and prepared the cauldron of oil and had the
strong guards ready. Then he bade them introduce the envoy.
Deng Zhi came, his ceremonial dress in perfect order, and advanced as far as
the gate. Seeing the grim array of fighting men armed, some with gleaming
swords, some with great axes, some with long spears, and some with short
knives, he understood at once what was meant, but he never blenched. He
advanced quite steadily and bravely till he reached the door of the hall. Even
when he saw the boiling cauldron of oil and the savage executioners glaring at
him, he only smiled.
He was led to the front of the curtain behind which sat the Prince of Wu, and
he made the ordinary salutation of raising his extended arms, but he did not
bow in obeisance.
The Prince bade his attendants roll up the curtain, and called out, âWhy do
you not make an obeisance?â
Deng Zhi replied, âThe envoy of the superior state does not make an obeisance
to the ruler of a smaller country.â
âIf you do not control that tongue of yours, but will let it wag, you will be
like that fellow Li Yiji who went to talk to Qi. You will soon find yourself in
the cauldron.â
Then Deng Zhi laughed aloud, saying, âPeople say there are many sages in Wu.
No one would believe that they would be frightened of a simple scholar.â
This reply only increased Sun Quanâs anger, and he said, âWho fears an
unmerited fool like you?â
âIf you fear not the envoy, why so anxious about what he may have to say?â
âBecause you come here as spokesman of Zhuge Liang, and you want me to sever
with Wei and turn to your country. Is not that your message?â
âI am a simple scholar of Shu, and I am come to explain matters to the state
of Wu. But here I find armed guards and a boiling cauldron all prepared against
an envoy. How can I form any other opinion than that you will not allow me to
speak?â
As soon as Sun Quan heard these words, he bade the soldiers go, and called the
envoy into the hall.
There he invited Deng Zhi to a seat and said, âWhat is the real matter
between Wei and Wu? I desire that you would inform me.â
Then Deng Zhi replied, âDo you, great Prince, desire to discuss peace with
Wei or with Shu?â
âI really desire to discuss peace with the Ruler of Shu. But he is young and
inexperienced and ignorant, and unable to carry a matter through.â
âPrince, you are a valiant warrior, just as Zhuge Liang is a great minister.
Now Shu has the strength of its mountainous geography just as Wu has the
protection of its three rivers. If these two countries are at peace, they are
mutually protective. They may swallow up the rest of the empire, or they may
stand secure alone. If you send tribute to Wei and acknowledge yourself one of
its ministers, you will be expected to attend at court, and your heir-apparent
will become a servant in that court; and if you disobey, an army of Wei will be
sent to attack you. Shu also will come down the river and invade your country.
Then the South Land will be yours no longer. And if you listen not to these
words of mine, and refuse my offer, I shall commit suicide before you to prove
I am not persuading you only for our own benefit.â
As Deng Zhi spoke these last words, he gathered up his robes and marched down
the hall as though he was just going to jump into the cauldron.
âStop him!â cried Sun Quan, and they did so.
Then he requested Deng Zhi to go into an inner apartment, where he treated the
envoy as a guest of the highest honor.
âO Master,â said Sun Quan, âyour words exactly express my thoughts, and I
desire to make a league of peace with your country. Are you willing to be the
intermediary?â
âJust now it was you, O Prince, who wished to boil this poor servant. Now it
is also you who wishes to use him. How can such a doubtful person be
trusted?â
âMy mind is made up,â replied Sun Quan. âDo not doubt me, Master.â
Deng Zhi was detained, and a conclave of officers gathered.
Said Sun Quan to the assembly, âUnder my hand are all eighty-one counties of
the southeast, and I have the lands of Jingzhou to boot, yet I am not so well
off as that little country of Shu, for Shu has Deng Zhi for an envoy, and he
glorifies his lord. I have no one to send to declare my wishes to Shu.â
Then one stepped forth and said he would go. The speaker was Zhang Wen of
Wucheng, who held the office of Imperial Commander.
âSir, I fear that when you reach Shu and are in the presence of Zhuge Liang,
you will not explain my real sentiments,â said Sun Quan.
Zhang Wen replied, âThink you that I shall fear him? He also is but a man.â
Sun Quan conferred great gifts on Zhang Wen, and sent him on the return mission
to Shu to negotiate the league of peace.
While Deng Zhi was absent, Zhuge Liang said to his lord, âThis mission to Wu
will succeed, and of the many wise people in the east one will come as return
envoy. Your Majesty should treat him with courtesy, and let him return to Wu to
complete the league. For if we have an alliance with Wu, Wei will not dare to
send an army against us. And if we are safe from those quarters, I will lead an
expedition to subdue the Mangs in the south country. After that we can deal
with Wei. If Wei is reduced, Wu will not last long, and the whole empire will
again be under one ruler.â
Presently the report reached the capital that Deng Zhi and Zhang Wen, as envoy
of Wu, would soon arrive. The Latter Ruler assembled the courtiers to receive
them honorably. The envoy of Wu carried himself as one who had attained his
desires, and advanced boldly. Having made his salute, the Latter Ruler gave him
to sit on a brocaded stool on his left hand. A banquet followed at which Zhang
Wen was treated with much honor. At the end of the banquet, the whole court
escorted the envoy to the guest-house where he was to lodge.
On the second day there was a banquet at the Prime Ministerâs palace, and
Zhuge Liang broached the real business.
He said, âOur First Ruler was not on friendly terms with Wu. But that is all
changed, as is demonstrated by these banquets, and our present Emperor is
disposed to be very friendly. It is hoped that the former enmity may be
entirely forgotten and the two countries swear eternal friendship and alliance
in their common end â-the destruction of Wei. I look to you, Sir, to speak in
favor of this league.â
Zhang Wen said that he would support the plan. The wine went merrily round, and
as the envoy became mellow, he laughed freely and swaggered and put on a proud
demeanor.
Next day the Latter Ruler gave Zhang Wen rich presents of gold and studs and
prepared a parting banquet for him in the south guest-chamber, and all the
court assembled to take leave of him. The Prime Minister paid him assiduous
attention and pressed him to drink. While this banquet was in progress, a man
suddenly came in as if he were already drunk, made a proud sort of salutation
to the company and at once took a seat.
His conduct seemed strange to Zhang Wen, who asked, âWho is the new comer,
Sir Prime Minister?â
âHe is a man named Qin Mi, a Doctorate Academician of Yizhou,â replied
Zhuge Liang.
âHe may be that,â said Zhang Wen with a laugh, âbut I wonder if he has
any learning at all inside him.â
Qin Mi listened without changing countenance, and said, âSince our children
are all learned, of course I am more so.â
âWhat may have been your special studies, Sir?â said Zhang Wen.
âMany things: Astronomy on one hand, geography on the other, the three
teachings and the nine systems, many philosophers, history all through, and
many sacred books and traditions.â
âSince you talk so big,â said Zhang Wen, âI should like to ask you a few
questions on celestial matters. Now has the sky a head?â
âYes, it has a head.â
âWhere is it?â
âIn the western quarter. The Odes say, âGod turns his head kindly toward
the west,â and further it follows from this that the head is in the west.â
âWell, has the sky ears?â
âOh, yes. The sky is above and listens to all things below. The Odes say,
âThe crane calls from the midst of the marsh, its cry is heard by the sky.â
How could the sky hear without ears?â
âHas the sky feet?â
âIt has. The Odes say, âHeaven treads down difficulties.â If there were
no feet, how could it tread?â
âHas heaven a name?â
âWhy not?â
âThen what is it?â
âLiu.â
âHow do you know that?â
âBecause the Emperorâs family name is Liu, and he is the Son of Heaven.
That is how I know.â
âDoes the sun spring from the east?â
âThough it does, yet it sets in the west.â
All this time Qin Miâs repartees had flashed back clear and perfect. They
came so naturally as to astonish all the guests. Zhang Wen had no word to reply
to them.
Then it became Qin Miâs turn, âYou are a famous scholar in your own land,
Sir; and since you have asked so many questions about Heaven, I take it you are
I well up in all celestial matters. When original chaos resolved into its two
elements yin and yang, the lighter portion rose and became sky, and the grosser
sank and solidified into earth. When Gong Gongâs rebellion was crushed, his
head struck the Imperfect Mountain, the pillar, which upholds heaven, was
broken and the bonds of earth were destroyed. Heaven fell over to the
northwest, and earth sank into the southeast. Since heaven was ethereal and had
floated to the top, how could it fall over? Another thing I do not know is what
is beyond the ether. I should be glad if you would explain, Master.â
Zhang Wen had no reply ready, but he rose from his place and bowed his
acknowledgment, saying, âI knew not that there was so much ability in this
land. I am happy to have heard such a discourse. Now all obstructions have
disappeared, and I see quite clearly.â
But Zhuge Liang, fearing lest the guest should feel mortified, soothed him with
fair words, saying, âThis is all play upon words, the sort of puzzles one
propounds at a merry feast. You, honored Sir, know that the tranquillity and
safety of states are no matters to joke with.â
The envoy bowed. Then Deng Zhi was ordered to return to Wu and thank its ruler
for his courtesy, and he was to accompany Zhang Wen. So both, having taken
leave of the Prime Minister, set out on their journey to the east.
In the meantime Sun Quan was beginning to feel perplexed at the long delay of
his envoy. He had summoned a council to discuss this question, when the report
came that his own envoy had returned, and Deng Zhi was with him. They were
brought in forthwith. Zhang Wen, having made his obeisance, began to discourse
upon the virtue of the Ruler of Shu and Zhuge Liang and to lay before his lord
the proposal for a league of peace. Deng Zhi, the Chair of the Secretariat, was
empowered to discuss this matter.
Turning to Deng Zhi, Sun Quan said, âWould it not be a happy result if
tranquillity should be restored to the empire by the destruction of Wei, and Wu
and Shu should share its administration?â
âThe sky knows not two suns,â replied Deng Zhi, ânor can the people
recognize two kings. If Wei be destroyed, no one can say upon whom the divine
command will devolve. But one who becomes an overlord must perfect his virtue,
and those who become ministers must be wholly loyal. In this way strife will
cease.â
Sun Quan smiled, saying, âAnd your sincerity is beyond question.â
Deng Zhi was dismissed with rich gifts, and after this Wu and Shu were good
friends.
The negotiations between his two rivals were reported in Capital Luoyang
without loss of time, and Cao Pi was very angry.
âIf they have made an alliance, it can only mean that they cherish the
intention of swallowing the Middle Land. My best move is to strike first.â
He called a great council. This council lacked the presence of Regent Marshal
Cao Ren and Grand Commander Jia Xu, who had both died.
In the council Counselor Xin Pi stepped forward and said, âThe Middle Land is
extensive, but the population so sparse that no successful army could be raised
just now. My advice is to wait ten years, spending that period in forming an
army and in cultivating the land till stores and weapons shall have been
accumulated. Then both our rivals may be destroyed.â
âThis is only the distorted opinion of a perverted pedant. Having made this
league, Shu and Wu may fall upon us at any moment. This matter cannot be
postponed for ten years,â said the Ruler of Wei.
An edict appeared commanding the enlistment of soldiers and the formation of an
army to subdue Wu.
Sima Yi then said, âBattleships are necessary, as Wu is protected by the
Great River. Your Majesty must lead small and big vessels. The navy can advance
by way of River Huai, taking Shouchun. When you reach Guangling, the river is
to be crossed and Nanxu is to be captured. Then Wu will be subdued.â
This plan was accepted, and the construction of dragon ships was put in hand
and went on day and night. Ten were built two hundred spans long to carry two
thousand marines each. They also collected three thousand fighting ships.
In the autumn of the fifth year of Yellow Dawn (AD 224) the various generals
assembled, and Cao Zhen was appointed leader of the first corps. Zhang Liao,
Zhang He, Wen Ping, and Xu Huang were Chief Commanders; Xu Chu and Lu Qian were
guards of the Center Army; and Cao Xiu commanded the rear guard; the
strategists were Liu Ye and Jiang Ji. In all, land and marine forces numbered
over three hundred thousand troops. When the starting day was decided upon,
Sima Yi was made Chair of the Secretariat and left in the capital with the
powers of Regent Marshal.
The spies told the Prince of Wuâs attendants of the dangers, and the latter
hastened to inform the Prince.
They said, âCao Pi is leading the dragon fleet and commanding three hundred
thousand marines and ground forces against the South Land, and the danger is
very great.â
When Sun Quan met his council, Gu Yong said, âMy lord, you can call upon Shu
for help according to the treaty. Write to Zhuge Liang and get him to send out
an army through Hanzhong so as to divert part of Weiâs army. Also you send an
army to Nanxu to oppose them there.â
âI shall have to recall Lu Xun,â said the Prince. âHe is the only man to
undertake this great task.â
âDo not move him if you can help it. He is necessary for the protection of
Jingzhou.â
âYes, I know. But there is no other strong enough to help me.â
At these words Xu Sheng advanced, saying, âI know I am not very able, but I
desire to be given an army to meet this danger. If Cao Pi crosses the river in
person, I will make him prisoner and present him at the gate of the Palace. If
he does not come over here, I will slay so many of his soldiers that his army
shall not dare even to look southward.â
Sun Quan was pleased to find a willing volunteer, and replied, âNoble Sir,
what anxiety need I feel if I have your protection?â
Xu Sheng was given the title of General Who Protects the East and made Chief
Commander of all the forces in Nanxu and Jianye. As soon as he had received his
orders, he retired. He gave command to gather enormous quantities of weapons,
and had many flags and banners made for the protection of the river banks.
But another impetuous young leader was anxious to take more vigorous measures,
and he stood forth, saying, âMy lord has laid upon you, O General, a heavy
responsibility. But if you really desire to destroy the invading force and
capture Cao Pi, you should send an army to meet him on the north side in the
South of River Huai. I fear failure if you wait till the northern troops have
come this far.â
The young man was Sun Shao, nephew of the Prince of Wu. Sun Shao was born to a
Yu family, and he was adopted by Sun Ce and given the Sun family name. He had
already the title of General Who Possesses Wide Prestige, and was in command at
Guangling. Though young and impetuous, he was very valiant.
Said Xu Sheng, âCao Piâs army is strong and its leaders famous. I hold that
we may not cross the river to meet him, but wait the arrival of his ships on
the other side. Then I shall carry out my plan.â
âI have three thousand troops of my own, and I know the country about
Guangling thoroughly. Let me go across the river and fight a battle. I will
willingly undergo the penalty if I fail,â said Sun Shao.
However, Xu Sheng refused, and all the pleadings of his impetuous general were
vain.
And when Sun Shao still persisted, the commander grew angry and said, âWhat
control shall I have if you are allowed to disobey orders?â
Xu Sheng ordered the lictors to take Sun Shao out and put him to death.
They led him away, and forthwith the black flag was hoisted. But one of Sun
Shaoâs generals went off in hot haste to tell Sun Quan, who came immediately
to try to save his favorite. Happily the execution had not been accomplished
when the Prince appeared on the scene, and he bade the executioners disperse.
The youth was saved.
Sun Shao began to press his claim to the Prince, saying, âI have been at
Guangling, and if we do not attack the enemy there, but let him get down to the
river, there will be an end of Wu.â
Sun Quan went into the camp, and Xu Sheng came to receive him.
When the Prince was seated in his tent, Xu Sheng said, âO Prince, you placed
me in command of the force to repulse Wei. Now this general of mine, Sun Shao,
is disobedient and should suffer death. I would ask why he should be
pardoned.â
âHe is naturally hot and impetuous. He has been guilty of disobedience, but I
hope you will overlook his fault.â
âThe law is none of my making, nor is it yours, O Prince. It is a state
penalty, and if relationship is enough to evade it, where is discipline?â
âHe has offended, and you have the right to judge and punish. But although
his real name is Yu Shao, yet my brother Sun Ce loved him and gave him our
family name. Further, Sun Shao has rendered me good service. If he should be
put to death, I should fail in my fraternal duty.â
âSince you have intervened, O Prince, I remit the death penalty.â
Sun Quan bade his nephew thank his chief, but the youth would not make an
obeisance. On the contrary, he loudly maintained the correctness of his view.
âLeading troops against Cao Pi is the only way,â cried Sun Shao. âI
cannot consent to your other plan even under the penalty of death!â
Xu Shengâs countenance changed. The recalcitrant young man was ordered to
leave the tent by Sun Quan.
âHe will not be any loss to us,â said Sun Quan to Xu Sheng, âand I will
not employ him again.â
Then the Prince left and returned to his own place.
That night they reported to Xu Sheng that Sun Shao had gone secretly over the
river with his own three thousand troops. Xu Sheng did not wish him to come to
harm, as evidently that would displease the Prince. So Xu Sheng sent a force to
support him. Ding Feng was chosen to command this reinforcement, and he was
told what to do.
The Ruler of Wei, in his dragon ships, reached Guangling, and the van got to
the river bank. He came to survey the position.
âHow many soldiers are on the other bank?â asked Cao Pi.
Cao Zhen replied, âI have not seen a single one. Nor are there any flags or
encampments.â
âThat is a ruse. I will go and find out.â
So Cao Pi set out to cross the river in one of the dragon ships. He anchored
under the bank. On his boat were displayed the imperial emblems of dragon,
phoenix, sun, moon, and they shone out bravely. Seated in the ship, the Emperor
looked up and down the south bank, but not a man was visible.
âDo you think we should cross?â asked the Emperor of his strategists.
Liu Ye replied, âIf the rules of war mean anything, they ought to be
prepared. We think Your Majesty should exercise caution. Wait a few days and
watch. Then perhaps the van might be sent to make a reconnaissance.â
âSo I think,â said the Ruler of Wei. âBut as it is now late, we will pass
the night on the river.â
It was a dark night, and the ships was brilliantly lighted up; it seemed like
day on board. But all along the south bank there appeared no glimmer of light.
âWhat do you think it means?â said Cao Pi.
The courtiers replied, âThey heard that Your Majestyâs heavenly army was
coming, and ran away like so many rats.â
The Ruler of Wei laughed to himself. When daylight came there came with it a
thick fog, so that nothing on the bank could be seen. After a time, a breeze
blew off the fog, and then, to their immense surprise, they found that the
whole length of the South of the Great River as far as they could see was one
battlement, with towers at intervals, while spears and swords glittered in the
sun and flags and pennons fluttered in the breeze.
In just a short time several reports came: âA long wall by the Great River
has grown up in a night and stood there with carts and masts of ships lying
along it, stretching some one hundred miles from Shidou to Nanxu.â
The fact was that the wall was an imitation, and the warriors that manned it
were bundles of reeds dressed in soldiersâ uniforms. And this was Xu
Shengâs tactic. But the sight chilled the ardor of the invaders.
âMy hosts of troops are no use against such warriors. We can do nothing
against those talents of the South Land,â said Cao Pi.
He thought over this sadly enough. But now the wind had increased in force, and
white combers began to heave up in the river, and waters broke over his boat,
drenching the dragon robes. The ship seemed as if it would roll right over. So
Cao Zhen sent out small boats to rescue his master and his people. But they
were too affrighted to move. Wherefore Wen Ping, who was in charge, leaped on
board and helped the Emperor down into one of the smaller craft, which then
flew away before the wind and got safely into a creek.
Soon came a hasty messenger to report: âZhao Zilong is marching out through
Yangping Pass and threatening Changan.â
This frightened Cao Pi so badly that he decided to retreat, and gave orders to
retire. The whole army were in a mood to run away, and moved off toward the
north, pursued by the troops of Wu. To hasten the march, the Ruler of Wei bade
his soldiers abandon all the imperial paraphernalia and impediments. The dragon
ships withdrew into River Huai one by one.
As they moved in disorder, suddenly arose the sounds of an enemy force, shouts
and the rolling of drums and the blaring of trumpets, and a cohort marched down
obliquely on to their line. And at the head was Sun Shao.
The troops of Wei could make no effective stand, and many were slain, while
large numbers were driven into the river and drowned. By dint of great efforts,
the Emperor was saved and got away up the river. But when they had sailed about
ten miles, they saw ahead a tract of blazing reeds. The enemy had poured fish
oil over the dry reeds and set them afire. The wind was spreading the flames
down river toward the fleet of Wei, and the heat was intense. The dragon ships
had to stop.
Cao Pi was put into a smaller craft and taken on shore. His larger ships were
presently set on fire and destroyed. They mounted the Emperor on a horse and
moved along the bank, but soon they fell in with another body of troops. This
time it was the supports under Ding Feng.
Zhang Liao rode ahead to engage the leader, but was soon wounded by an arrow of
Ding Feng in the loins. However, he was helped away by Xu Huang, and the Ruler
of Wei was gotten safely out of the turmoil. The loss of soldiers was heavy,
and a huge booty of horses, carts, ships, and weapons fell to the victors.
So the Wei armies went away north thoroughly beaten, while Xu Sheng had scored
a great success. Sun Quan richly rewarded him.
Zhang Liao got to Xuchang, but only to die from the effects of his wound. He
was honorably buried by the Ruler of Wei.
It has been said that Zhao Zilong was threatening Changan. But soon after he
went through Yangping Pass, the Prime Minister of Shu sent a dispatch to recall
him because General Yong Kai in Yizhou had joined himself with the Mangs and
invaded the four southern territories. So Zhao Zilong returned. Meanwhile Ma
Chao was ordered to take command of Yangping Pass. The Prime Minister was about
to go to subdue the nations along the south border. He was then preparing at
Chengdu for this expedition.
First Wu met Wei and drove them north,
Then Shu against the Mangs went south.
The story of this campaign will follow in the next chapters.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 87 ****
With Prime Minister Zhuge Liangâs administration of affairs in the two River
Lands began a period of happiness and prosperity for the people. Tranquillity
prevailed, and the state of society was well nigh perfect: Doors unbolted at
night, property left by the roadside remaining untouched till the owner
returned for it. Moreover, the harvests were rich year after year, and old and
young, with fair, round bellies, well lined, simply sang with joy. The people
hastened to fulfill their state duties and vied with each other in the
performance of all arts. As a natural consequence all military preparations
were perfect, the granaries bursting with grain and the treasury full to
overflowing.
Such was the state of things when, in the third year of Beginning Prosperity
(AD 225), the news came from Yizhou to the capital to report: âThe Mang King,
Meng Huo, leading one hundred thousand Mang tribesmen, has invaded the south
and is laying waste the country. Yong Kai, the Governor of Jianning, a descent
of the Han Lord Yong Chi of Shifang, had joined Meng Huo to rebel. Zhu Bao and
Gao Ding, the Governors of Zangge and Yuesui, have yielded to the invaders. But
the Governor of Yongchang, Wang Kang, is staunchly holding out. The three
rebels â-Yong Kai, Gao Ding, and Zhu Bao â-, who had joined the invaders,
are now acting as guides and assisting in the attack on Yongchang, which has
remained faithful. Governor Wang Kang, ably assisted by Lu Kai, his Deputy
Governor, is making a all-out effort to defend the city with only its ordinary
inhabitants as fighting men. The position is very desperate.â
When this news came, Zhuge Liang went into the Palace and thus memorialized to
his lord, âThe contumacy of the Mangs is a real danger to our state. I feel
it incumbent upon me to lead an expedition to reduce the tribespeople to
obedience.â
But the Latter Ruler was afraid, and said, âSun Quan is in the east, and Cao
Pi the north. If you abandon me and either of them comes, what shall I do?â
âYour Majesty need have no fear. We have just concluded a league of peace
with Wu, and I think they will be true to their pledge. Li Yan in Baidicheng is
quite a match for Lu Xun. Cao Piâs recent defeat has taken the keenness out
of his army, so that he will not feel inclined to make any expeditions further.
Ma Chao is in command at the passes between Wei and Hanzhong. I shall also
leave Guan Xing and Zhang Bao with forces to reinforce any point where danger
may appear. I can assure Your Majesty that no untoward event will happen.
âI am going to sweep clean the Mang country, so that we may have a free hand
to attack Wei when the day comes. Thus I shall be enabled to requite the honor
paid me by your father the First Ruler, who came thrice to seek me and who
doubled my obligation when he confided to me the care of his son.â
âIndeed I am young and ignorant,â replied the Latter Ruler, âand can only
exist with you to decide for me.â
At that moment Counselor Wang Lian, a man of Nanyang, stepped forward, crying,
âNo, no, Sir; you may not go! The South Mang is a wild country reeking with
malaria. It is wrong that an officer of state in such an exalted and
responsible position should go away on a distant expedition. These rebels and
tribespeople are but an irritation, not a disease, and an ordinary leader would
be enough to send against them. He would not fail.â
Zhuge Liang replied, âThis country of the Mangs is distant and mostly tribal.
To pacify them will be difficult, and I feel I ought to go. When to be harsh
and when to show leniency are matters to be decided on at the moment, and
instructions cannot be easily given to another.â
Zhuge Liang steadily opposed all Wang Lianâs efforts to bring about a change
of intention, and he soon took leave of the Latter Ruler and made ready to
start.
Jiang Wan was Army Counselor of the expedition; Fei Yi, Secretary; Dong Jue and
Fan Jian, Army Inspectors; Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan, Commanders; Wang Ping and
Zhang Yi, Deputy Commanders. Beside these were other half a hundred leaders and
officers of Shu, and the whole force was five hundred thousand troops.
Soon after the force marched south to Yizhou, Guan Suo, the third son of Guan
Yu, appeared and wished to see Zhuge Liang.
And Guan Suo said to him, âAfter the fall of Jingzhou, I was hidden by the
Bao family from where I wanted to go to the River Lands to ask the First Ruler
for a revenge for my father. But I fell in illness, which was long and severe,
and I only just recovered. I was then traveling toward Chengdu to meet with the
Latter Ruler, when I met the army in the south expedition. I know that
vengeance has been taken on the murderers of my father. And now I want to
present myself to the Prime Minster.â
Zhuge Liang was greatly affected to see him. He sent news of the young manâs
arrival to the court and gave Guan Suo a post of Van Leader.
The army, foot and horse, marched in the best of order, eating when hungry,
drinking when thirsty, camping at night, and moving by day. No plundering was
permitted, and the people suffered not at all.
When Yong Kai and his fellow rebels heard that Zhuge Liang was marching against
them, they called their troops together and formed three divisions, Gao Ding in
the center, Yong Kai on the left, and Zhu Bao on the right. They mustered about
fifty thousand troops in each army, and they went to oppose the march of the
Shu army.
Gao Ding sent E Huan to lead the van. This E Huan was nine spans tall in
stature, and savage of countenance. His weapon was a two-bladed halberd. He was
very valiant and could face many warriors. He led his own cohort out in advance
of the main body and fell in with the leading bodies of the Shu army
immediately after they had got into Yizhou.
The two sides drew up for battle. The arrays being complete, Wei Yan rode out
and vilified the rebels, shouting, âO malcontent! Be quick to surrender!â
Instead, E Huan galloped out and fought with Wei Yan. After a few bouts Wei Yan
seemed to be bested and fled. But this was only a ruse. As E Huan followed, the
gongs clanged and from left and right poured out Zhang Yi and Wang Ping. Wei
Yan turned around, and three generals besieged and captured E Huan.
He was taken to the tent of Zhuge Liang, who bade his attendants loose his
bonds, gave him wine, and comforted him.
Then Zhuge Liang asked, âWhom do you belong to?â
E Huan replied, âI am one of the generals under Gao Ding.â
âI know Gao Ding as a loyal and good sort, but he has been led away by this
Yong Kai. Now I shall release you, but you are to bring Gao Ding to his senses
and see to it that he comes to surrender and avoids grave disaster.â
E Huan thanked him and withdrew. He went to his own side and soon saw Gao Ding.
He told Gao Ding what Zhuge Liang had said, and Zhuge Liangâs kindly feeling
deeply affected Gao Ding.
Next day, Yong Kai came over to Gao Dingâs camp to visit him.
After the exchange of salutations, Yong Kai asked, âHow did E Huan manage to
return?â
âZhuge Liang released him out of pure kindness,â replied Gao Ding.
âThis is a ruse of his to separate you from me: He wishes to make us
enemies.â
Gao Ding almost believed this too, and he was much perplexed.
Just then the watchers reported that the leaders of Shu had come up and were
offering battle. So Yong Kai led out thirty thousand troops to take up the
challenge. But after the third encounter he fled. Wei Yan pursued him and smote
for a distance of seven miles.
Next day Yong Kai challenged, but the soldiers of Shu refused to fight, and
remained within their lines for three days. On the fourth day Yong Kai and Gao
Ding divided their troops into two parts and came to attack the camp. Now Zhuge
Liang had told Wei Yan to wait for this double attack, and so when it came to
pass, both divisions fell into an ambush and suffered great loss, many being
killed and more captured.
The prisoners were taken to the camp, and the soldiers belonging to the two
leaders â-Yong Kai and Gao Ding â-were confined separately. Then Zhuge
Liang told the soldiers to let it be known that only those belonging to Gao
Ding would be spared, the others would be put to death. When time had been
given for this story to spread among the prisoners, Yong Kaiâs troops were
brought up to the commanderâs tent.
âWhose soldiers were you?â asked Zhuge Liang.
âGao Dingâs,â cried they all, falsely.
Then they were all pardoned, and, after being given wine and food, they were
taken to the frontier and set free.
Next the real Gao Dingâs soldiers were brought forward, and the same question
was put to them.
âWe all really belong to Gao Dingâs command,â said they.
In like manner they were pardoned and refreshed with wine and food.
Then Zhuge Liang addressed them, saying, âYong Kai has just sent a messenger
to ask that he may surrender, and he offers to bring with him the heads of Gao
Ding and Zhu Bao as a proof of merit. But I will not receive him, and you,
since you are Gao Dingâs soldiers, shall be released and allowed to return to
him. But let there be no ingratitude and fighting again, for if there is, I
certainly will not pardon you next time.â
So they thanked their liberator and went away. As soon as they reached their
own camp, they told the whole story. Then Gao Ding sent a spy to the camp of
Yong Kai to find out what was doing. There the spy met those who had been
released, and they were all talking about Zhuge Liangâs kindness, and many of
them were inclined to desert their own camp for the other.
Although this seemed very satisfactory, yet Gao Ding did not feel convinced,
and he sent another man to Zhuge Liangâs camp to try to verify the rumor. But
this man was captured and taken before the Commander-in-Chief, who pretended
that he thought the spy belonged to Yong Kai.
Zhuge Liang said to him, âWhy has your leader failed to send me the heads of
Gao Ding and Zhu Bao as he promised? You lot are not very clever, and what are
you come to spy out?â
The soldier muttered and mumbled in confusion.
But Zhuge Liang gave the man wine and food, and then wrote a letter which he
handed to the spy, saying, âYou give this letter to your commander, Yong Kai,
and tell him to get the job done quickly.â
The spy took the letter and got away. As soon as he reached camp, he gave the
letter to Gao Ding and also the message.
Gao Ding read the missive and became very angry.
âI have ever been true to him, and yet he wants to kill me. It is hard to be
either friendly or reasonable.â
Then he decided to take E Huan into his confidence, and called him.
E Huan was much prejudiced in favor of Zhuge Liang, and said, âZhuge Liang is
a most benevolent man, and it would be ill to turn our backs upon him. It is
Yong Kaiâs fault that we are now rebels, and our best course would be to slay
him and betake ourselves to Zhuge Liang.â
âHow could it be done?â asked Gao Ding.
âInvite him to a banquet. If he refuses, it means he is a traitor, and then
you can attack him in front while I will lie in wait behind his camp to capture
him as he runs away.â
They agreed to try this plan. The banquet was prepared, and Yong Kai invited.
But as Yong Kaiâs mind was full of suspicion from what his returned soldiers
had said, he would not come. That night, as soon as darkness fell, Gao Ding
attacked his camp.
Now the soldiers who had been released were imbued with the goodness of Gao
Ding all quite ready to help him fight. On the other hand, Yong Kaiâs troops
mutinied against him, and so Yong Kai mounted his steed and fled. Before he had
gone far, he found his road blocked by the cohort under E Huan, who galloped
out with his halberd and confronted the fugitive. Yong Kai could not defend
himself, and was struck down. E Huan decapitated him. As soon as they knew he
was dead, his troops joined themselves to Gao Ding, who then went and
surrendered to Zhuge Liang.
Zhuge Liang received Gao Ding sitting in state in his tent, but at once ordered
the lictors to decapitate Gao Ding.
But Gao Ding said, âInfluenced by your kindness, Sir, I have brought the head
of my colleague as a proof of the sincerity of my surrender. Why should I
die?â
âYou come with false intent. Do you think you can hoodwink me?â said Zhuge
Liang, laughing.
âWhat proof have you that I am false?â
Zhuge Liang drew a letter from his box, and said, âZhu Bao sent this secretly
to say he wished to surrender, and he said you and Yong Kai were sworn friends
to death. How could you suddenly change your feelings and slay him? That is how
I know your treachery.â
âZhu Bao only tried to make trouble,â cried Gao Ding, kneeling.
Zhuge Liang still refused to believe him, and said, âI cannot believe you
without more solid proof. If you would slay Zhu Bao, I could take that as
proving you were sincere in your surrender.â
âDo not doubt me. What if I go and capture this man?â
âIf you did that, my doubts would be set at rest.â
Thereupon Gao Ding and his subordinate, E Huan, led away their troops to the
camp of Zhu Bao. When they were about three miles from his camp, Zhu Bao
appeared with a cohort. As soon as they recognized each other, Zhu Bao hastily
came forward to parley.
But Gao Ding cried out to him, âWhy did you write a letter to the Prime
Minister and so intrigue with him to get me killed?â
Zhu Bao stared open mouthed and could not reply. Then E Huan rode out from
behind his chief and struck Zhu Bao with his halberd so that he fell to the
ground.
Thereupon Gao Ding shouted, âThe soldiers should either yield or be slain!â
And they yielded in a body.
Gao Ding then went back to Zhuge Liang and offered the head of the man just
slain.
Zhuge Liang laughed again. âI have made you kill both these as a proof of
loyalty.â
Then he created Gao Ding Governor of Yizhou and chief of three territories,
while E Huan was made General. Thus the three rebel divisions were disposed of
and troubled the peace no more.
Governor Wang Kang of Yongchang then came out of the city and welcomed Zhuge
Liang.
When Zhuge Liang had made his entry into that city, he called Wang Kang and
asked, âWho has aided you in the defense of this city?â
The Governor said, âThe safety of this city is due entirely to Lu Kai.â
So Lu Kai was called. He came and bowed.
Zhuge Liang said, âLong since I heard of you as a remarkable person of this
area. We are greatly indebted to you for its safety. Now we wish to conquer the
Mangs. Have you any advice to offer?â
Lu Kai then produced a map of the country and presented it, saying, âFrom the
time of my appointment, I have felt certain that the southern tribespeople
would rise against you, and so I sent secret agents to map out the country and
find the strategic points. From that information I prepared this map, which I
call âThe Plan to Subdue the Mangs.â I beg you, Sir, to accept it, as it
may be of use.â
Zhuge Liang was very glad. He took Lu Kai into his service as Adviser and Army
Guide. With Lu Kaiâs help, Zhuge Liang advanced and penetrated deeply into
the country.
While the army was advancing, there came a messenger from the court. When he
appeared, Zhuge Liang saw it was Ma Su, and he was clothed in white. He was in
mourning for his brother, Ma Liang, who had just died.
He said, âI come by special command of the Emperor with gifts of wine and
silks for the soldiers.â
When the ceremonies proper on receipt of a mandate from the Emperor had been
performed, and the gifts distributed as instructed, Ma Su was asked to remain
to talk over matters.
Zhuge Liang said, âI have His Majestyâs command to conquer these Mangs. I
hear you have some advice to offer, and I should be pleased if you would
instruct me.â
âYes. I have one thing to say that may be worth thinking over. These people
refuse to recognize our supremacy, because they think their country is distant
and difficult. If you should overcome them today, tomorrow they would revolt.
Wherever your army marches, they are overcome and submit; but the day you
withdraw the army and attack Cao Pi, they will renew their attack. In arms even
it is best to attack hearts rather than cities; to fight with sentiment is
better than to fight with weapons. It will be well if you can win them over.â
âYou read my inmost thoughts,â said Zhuge Liang.
Then Ma Su was retained with the army as Adviser, and the army marched on.
When the King of the Mangs, Meng Huo, heard how cleverly Zhuge Liang had got
rid of Yong Kai, he called together the leaders of the âThree Ravinesâ to
discuss matters. The chief of the first Ravine was Jinhua Sanjie, of the second
Dongtu Na, and of the third Ahui Nan.
These having come to the Kingâs place, he said to them, âZhuge Liang of Shu
and his Grand Army has invaded our country, and we must exert our united
strength to drive out the invaders. You three must lead your forces, and
whoever conquers the enemy shall be chief of chiefs.â
It was arranged that Jinhua Sanjie should march in the center division, Dongtu
Na on the left, and Ahui Nan on the right. Each division was fifty thousand
tribesmen.
When the scouts made out that the Mang armies were coming, they at once told
Zhuge Liang, who called Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan to his side, but gave them no
orders.
Next he sent for Wang Ping and Ma Zheng, and said to them, âI cannot send
Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan against the Mangs because they do not know the country.
You two are to go, one against each wing, and the two veteran warriors shall
support you. Get your troops ready and start tomorrow at dawn.â
Wang Ping and Ma Zheng took the orders and went out.
Then Zhang Yi and Zhang Ni were given orders: âYou two are to march against
the center army. You are to act with Wang Ping and Ma Zheng tomorrow. I want to
send Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan, but I am still afraid they do not know the
country well.â
Zhang Yi and Zhang Ni also received the orders and went out.
Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan now began to feel hurt.
Noticing this, Zhuge Liang said, âI have no wish to pass you over, you two,
but I fear that if you get too deeply into the country and should fall victims
to the Mangs, it will have an ill effect on the others.â
âBut what if we did know the geography of the country?â said Zhao Zilong.
âAll I say to you is to be careful how you do anything,â replied Zhuge
Liang.
The two soldiers left and went together to the camp of Zhao Zilong.
Zhao Zilong said, âWe are greatly ashamed at being put in the background
because we do not know the country. We cannot bear this.â
âThen let us ride out and survey,â said his colleague. âLet us capture a
few natives and make them show us the road, and let us defeat these
tribesmen.â
They rode off. Before they had gone far they saw a cloud of dust in the
distance. Climbing a hill to get a better view, they saw a small party of
mounted Mangs coming toward them. The two waited till they were near and then
suddenly burst out. The Mangs, taken entirely by surprise, ran away all but a
few, who yielded themselves prisoners. The two warriors returned to camp.
The prisoners were given wine and food. When they had satisfied their hunger,
they were questioned.
Said they, âThe camp of Chief Jinhua Sanjie is just in front, just by the
entrance to the mountains. Near the camp, running east and west, is the Five
Valleys. The camps of the other two chiefs â-Dongtu Na and Ahui Nan â-are
behind.â
Having listening to this information, Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan got together five
thousand troops, took the captured men as guides, and marched out about the
second watch. It was a clear night, and the moon gave light to march by.
The first camp was reached about the fourth watch. The Mang soldiers were
already awake and preparing their morning meal, as they intended to attack at
daylight. Suddenly Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan gave a signal of attack, and their
troops poured forward. The vigorous and unexpected attack of the two generals
threw the camp into confusion. Zhao Zilong fought into the center of the camp
and encountered Jinhua Sanjie. Both leaders engaged, and Zhao Zilong slew
Jinhua Sanjie by a spear thrust. Then Zhao Zilong dismounted and cut off the
head of the Chief.
Next Wei Yan took half the force and went west to the second camp, while Zhao
Zilong marched east to the third one. By the time they reached the camps, day
had dawned. The Mangs also had news of Wei Yanâs coming, and drew up the camp
to oppose. But when they had got clear, there was a great uproar behind them at
the stockade gates, and confusion followed. The reason was the arrival of Wang
Ping. Between the two bodies, the Mangs were beaten. Their Chief, Dongtu Na,
forced his way out and got away. Wei Yanâs soldiers followed, but they could
not catch him.
When Zhao Zilong led his troops east to attack the third camp in the rear, Ma
Zheng made an attack on the front. They scored a success, but the Chief Ahui
Nan escaped.
They returned to headquarters, and Zhuge Liang said, âThe three parties of
Mangs have fled, and Dongtu Na and Ahui Nan escaped. Where is the head of
Jinhua Sanjie?â
Zhao Zilong produced it. At the same time he reported: âDongtu Na and Ahui
Nan escaped by abandoning their horses and going over the hills. Therefore,
they could not be followed.â
âThey are already prisoners,â said Zhuge Liang with a laugh.
The fighting men could not credit it. But soon after Zhang Ni brought out
Dongtu Na; and Zhang Yi, Ahui Nan.
When the Shu leaders expressed surprise and admiration, Zhuge Liang said, âI
had studied the map and knew the positions of the camps. I taunted Zhao Zilong
and Wei Yan into making a supreme effort into the camp of Jinhua Sanjie. At the
same time I sent other forces under Wang Ping and Ma Zheng, with the purpose to
support Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan and to force Dongtu Na and Ahui Nan to flee. I
felt certain the two chiefs would run away along those small roads, and I set
soldiers under Zhang Ni and Zhang Yi on those roads to wait for them. They also
were supported.â
They all bowed, saying, âThe Prime Ministerâs calculations are divine and
incomprehensible.â
The two captive chiefs were then called. As soon as they appeared, Zhuge Liang
loosed their bonds, gave them refreshments, and released them, bidding them
offend no more. They thanked him for their liberty, and disappeared along a by-
road.
Then Zhuge Liang said to his generals, âTomorrow Meng Huo will come in person
to make an attack. We shall probably capture him.â
Then he summoned Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan and gave them orders. They left, each
with five thousand troops. Next he sent Wang Ping and Guan Suo away with
instructions. And then he and other officers sat in his tent to wait for the
result.
The King of the Mangs was sitting in his tent when the scouts told him that his
three chiefs had been captured and their armies scattered. It made him very
angry, and he quickly got his army ready to march. Soon he met Wang Ping and
Guan Suo, and, when the armies were arrayed, Wang Ping rode out to the front,
saber in his hand. The flaunting banners of the array formation of his foes
then opened out, and he saw their ranks. Many generals were on horseback on
both sides. In the middle was the King, who advanced to the front. He wore a
golden, inlaid headdress; his belt bore a lionâs face as clasp; his boots had
pointed toes and were green; he rode a frizzy-haired horse the color of a red
hare; he carried at his waist a pair of swords chased with the pine amber.
He looked haughtily at his foes, and then, turning to his generals, said, âIt
has always been said that Zhuge Liang is a wonderful strategist, but I see that
is false. Look at this array with its banners all in confusion and the ranks in
disorder. There is not a weapon among all the swords and spears better than
ours. If I had only realized this before, I would have fought them long ago.
Who dares go out and capture a Shu general to show them what sort of warriors
we are?â
At once a general rode toward the leader Wang Ping. His name was Mangya Chang.
His weapon was a huge headsmanâs sword, and he rode a dun pony. Riding up to
Wang Ping, the two engaged.
Wang Ping only fought a short time, and then fled. Meng Huo at once ordered his
troops on in quick pursuit, and the troops of Shu retreated seven miles or so
before the Mangs were near enough to fight. Just as the Mangs thought their
enemies were in their power, a great shouting arose and two cohorts appeared,
Zhang Ni from the left and Zhang Yi from the right, and attacked. The Mangs
could not retreat, and as the force under Wang Ping and Guan Suo also turned
upon them, the Mangs were surrounded and lost the day. Meng Huo and some of his
generals fought their way out and made for the Brocade Mountains. The troops of
Shu followed and forced them forward, and presently there appeared, in front,
Zhao Zilong.
Meng Huo hastily changed his route to go deeper into the mountains, but Zhao
Zilongâs soldiers spread around, and the Mangs could not make a stand. Here
many were captured. Meng Huo and a few horsemen got away into a valley, which,
however, soon became too narrow for the horses to advance. Meng Huo then left
his horse and crawled up the mountains, but very soon he fell upon Wei Yan, who
had been sent with five hundred troops to lie in wait in that very valley. Meng
Huo tried to struggle but soon was captured.
The King and his followers were taken to the main camp, where Zhuge Liang was
waiting with wine and meat ready for the captives. But his tent was now guarded
by soldiers all well armed with snow-glittering weapons, beside the lictors
bearing the golden axes, a present from the Emperor, and other insignia of
rank. The feather-hatted drummers and clarion players were in front and behind,
and the Imperial Guards were extended on both sides. The whole was very
imposing and awe-inspiring.
Zhuge Liang was seated at the top of it all and watched the captives as they
came forward in crowds. When they were all assembled, he ordered their bonds to
be loosed, and then he addressed them.
âYou are all simple and well-disposed people who have been led into trouble
by Meng Huo. I know your fathers and mothers, your brothers and wives, and your
children are anxiously watching from the doorways for your return, and they are
cut to dear suffering that the news of defeat and capture has reached their
ears. They are weeping bitter tears for you. And so I will set you all free to
go home and comfort them.â
After they had been given food and wine and a present of grain, he sent them
all away. They went off grateful for the kindness shown them, and they wept as
they thanked Zhuge Liang.
Then the guards were told to bring the King before the tent. He came, bound,
being hustled forward. He knelt in front of the Commander-in-Chief.
Zhuge Liang said, âWhy did you rebel after the generous treatment you have
received from our Emperor?â
âThe two River Lands belonged to others, and your lord took it from them by
force, and gave himself the title of Emperor. My people have lived here for
ages, and you and your cohorts invaded my country without the least excuse. How
can you talk of rebellion to me?â
âYou are my prisoner. Will you submit or are you still contumacious?â
âWhy should I submit? You happened to find me in a narrow place. That is
all.â
âIf I release you, what then?â
âIf you release me I shall return, and when I have set my army in order, I
shall come to fight you again. However, if you catch me once more, I will
submit.â
The Kingâs bonds were loosed. He was clothed and refreshed, given a horse and
caparisons, and sent with a guide to his own camp.
Once more the captured chieftain is let go,
To yield tribesmen are ever slow.
Further results of this war will be related in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 88 ****
The officers did not approve of the release of the King of the Mangs, and they
came to the tent of Zhuge Liang and said, âMeng Huo is the most important
personage of all the Mangs, and his capture is the key to restoring order in
the south. Why then, O Minister, did you release him?â
âI can capture him just as easily as I can get something out of my pocket.
What I want to do is to overcome and win his heart, so that peace may follow of
itself.â
They listened, but they had no great confidence in the success of the policy of
conciliation.
In the meantime Meng Huo had reached the River Lu, and there he fell in with
some of his defeated leaders, who were trying to get news of their Kingâs
fate.
They were surprised, but glad, to see him, and asked, âHow were Your Highness
able to get back?â
The King lied, saying, âThey confined me in a tent, and I broke out in the
night. I slew more than ten guards and ran. And then I met one of their
sentries, killed him, and that is how I got this horse.â
They never doubted his word, and very joyfully they hurried him over the river
to a camping place. Then all the notables assembled from the various ravines,
and the soldiers that had escaped death were mustered and got into shape as a
fighting force.
The two leaders in the late campaign, Dongtu Na and Ahui Nan, were in one of
the ravines, and Meng Huo sent to ask them to come. They were afraid, but they
could not disobey, and they came with an escort.
When all had assembled, the King proclaimed as follows: âI know Zhuge Liang
is too full of ruses for us to conquer him in a fight; we should only fall
victims to other base devices. However, we must remember that his soldiers have
marched far and the weather is sultry, which are factors in our favor. Beside,
River Lu is our rampart. We will have boats and rafts on the south side, and we
will build a mud wall. With such good defenses we can afford to wait and see
what the enemy intends.â
His speech met with approval, and his plan was carried out. The wall was
supported by the hills and strengthened by fighting turrets, upon which were
placed large bows and crossbows and arrows and stones. The defenses looked as
if they were permanent. Moreover, each ravine sent supplies in plenty. And
having made these preparations, Meng Huo felt comfortable and safe.
Zhuge Liang had advanced, and his leading division was now close to the river.
Spies came back to report: âNo boats or rafts can be found to cross, and the
current is too strong to think of fording. Beside, we can see the formidable
defenses on the farther bank, the mud wall and the turrets all fully manned.â
The weather was burning hot, for it was the fifth month, and the soldiers could
not tolerate their armor nor even their clothing.
When Zhuge Liang had inspected the river, he returned to his tent and assembled
his officers, to whom he read this order: âThe enemy is securely established
on the south bank ready to repel our attack. Yet, having come so far, we cannot
return empty. For the present you will all seek what shelter you can find in
the forests, and rest and refresh your troops.â
Then he sent Lu Kai to a distance to select a cool stretch of thirty miles, and
there he made four stockades. Within the stockades he built huts for the
soldiers and sheds for the horses, so that they were sheltered from the intense
heat. The four camps were stationed by Wang Ping, Zhang Ni, Zhang Yi, and Guan
Suo.
However, Jiang Wan, observed these shelters and went to Zhuge Liang, saying,
âThese shelters of Lu Kai are very unsuitable. He has made the same mistake
as that which led to the defeat of the First Ruler at the hands of Wu. He has
not taken into account the surroundings of the stockades; and if the Mangs
should come over and start a fire, there could be no rescue.â
âDo not anticipate trouble,â said the Commander-in-Chief, smiling. âI
have provided against all such dangers.â
Jiang Wan did not know what the chief meant to do, but he said no more. Then Ma
Dai arrived from the River Lands, and he brought summer medicines and further
supplies of grain. He saw Zhuge Liang, and then proceeded to distribute the
supplies he had brought according to orders.
Then Zhuge Liang said, âWhat force have you brought?â
âThree thousand,â replied Ma Dai.
âMy people are weary and worn out. I want to use yours. You have no
objections?â
âOf course not. They are equally government troops. They are ready even to
die for you if you wish.â
âThis Meng Huo is established on the river, and we have no means of crossing.
But I am anxious to intercept his supplies, so that his troops may mutiny.â
âHow can you do it?â
âSome fifty miles lower down River Lu there is a place called Shakou, where
the current is slow and shallow because of sand. You could cross there on
rafts. I wish you and your soldiers to cross and cut the road of supplies.
After that you are to arrange with the two leaders â-Dongtu Na and Ahui Nan
â-whose lives I spared, to be your allies on the inside, and we shall
succeed.â
Ma Dai went off gladly enough, and marched his troops to Shakou, where they set
about the crossing at once. And as the water was shallow, they did not trouble
to make rafts, but just tucked up their clothes and waded in. But half-way
across, the men began to fall over; and when they had been rescued and taken to
the bank, many of them began to bleed from the nose and mouth and died. In
great alarm, Ma Dai sent hasty messages to Zhuge Liang, who called in the
native guides and asked what this meant.
They told him, âIt happens so every year. In the hot season, poisonous miasma
collects over the waters of the River Lu, especially during the heat of the
day. Anyone who drinks the water will surely die. Travelers who wish to cross
have to wait till night, because the cooler waters do not breathe out the
poisonous vapors. Further, the crossing should be attempted on a full
stomach.â
Zhuge Liang bade the local guides point out the best crossing place. He sent
five hundred well-seasoned soldiers to Ma Dai to lash together poles into rafts
at Shakou, and in the night the crossing was safely accomplished. Further, the
guides then led two thousand men of Shu over to where the grain road of the
Mangs led through a narrow valley, called Jiashan Gorge, where, for part of the
way, only single file was possible as the road was only wide enough for a
soldier and a horse.
Ma Dai at once occupied this valley and stationed a force there. And a stockade
was put up with tents inside. Presently a convoy of grain came along, and it
was captured, more than a hundred wagons. The guards ran off to Meng Huoâs
great camp and told him.
Meng Huo, thinking all was safe during the hot season, was enjoying himself.
Wine and music were the order of the day, and military matters were far from
his thoughts. In his cups he admitted Zhuge Liang was ruseful, but said his
army had nothing to fear.
Said he, âIf I attempt to oppose Zhuge Liang, I shall certainly fall a victim
to some wile of his. However, my waiting policy is a safe one. With our
defenses, and the river to back them, we can wait for the heat to overcome
these men of Shu, who cannot stand the hot season. They will have to retreat,
and then we can harass them. And we will capture this Zhuge Liang.â
He lay back and laughed at the thought.
However, one chief, more prudent than the others, stood forth and said,
âRemember the shallows at Shakou. It would be very serious if the soldiers of
Shu got across there secretly. It ought to be guarded.â
âYou belong to these areas. Do you not know that I want the enemy to try to
get across there? Why, they will all perish in the water.â
âBut what if the natives tell them to cross only in the night?â
âDo not be so anxious,â said Meng Huo. âOur own people will not help the
enemy that far.â
It was just then that intelligence came: âThe troops of Shu, unknown in
number, have crossed the river and, moreover, have seized the Jiashan Gorge.
The flags show the words âGeneral Who Pacifies The North, Ma Daiâ.â
Meng Huo affected indifference.
âThis sort of fellow is not worth talking about,â said he.
He sent General Mangya Chang with three thousands troops to recapture the gorge
and reopen the grain road.
When Ma Dai saw the Mang soldiers approaching, he placed two thousand troops in
front of the hills and drew up the troops in formal array. Then Mangya Chang
rode out to give battle. This was but a small engagement, as the general of the
tribespeople fell at the first stroke of Ma Daiâs sword. The Mangs ran away
at once.
They returned to the Kingâs camp and told him what had happened. Whereupon he
called up all his generals and asked for another to go up against Ma Dai.
âI will go,â cried Dongtu Na.
The King gave him three thousand troops. After he had gone, Meng Huo thought it
would be wise to keep others from crossing the river. So he sent a force of
three thousand under Ahui Nan to guard Shakou.
Dongtu Na duly arrived at the gorge and made a camp. Ma Dai came out to meet
him. Among the soldiers in his cohort were some who recognized the leader of
the Mangs and told Ma Dai certain things about how he had been captured and
liberated.
So Ma Dai galloped toward him, shouting, âO you ingrate! How could you forget
the debt to the Prime Minister? Have you known no shame?â
Dongtu Na was very greatly ashamed and turned red in the face, and turned his
horse before striking a blow. Ma Dai followed and fell on, slaying many of the
Mangs. Then both sides withdrew.
Dongtu Na went back and told the King that Ma Dai was too strong for him.
But Meng Huo was angry, and cried, âYou are a traitor! I know Zhuge Liang was
good to you, and that is why you would not fight.â
Meng Huo ordered Dongtu Na out to execution. However, the notables and chiefs
interceded, and the death penalty was remitted, but the unhappy leader was
severely beaten, one hundred strokes with the heavy staff.
The chiefs were mostly on the side of the beaten general and against the
Kingâs policy.
They went to the tent of Dongtu Na and said, âThough we live in the Mang
country, we have never had any thoughts of rebellion against the Imperial
Government, nor has the Middle Kingdom ever encroached upon our land. We must
own that Meng Huoâs superior power forced us into this rising, and we could
not help ourselves. Zhuge Liang is too clever for us, and no one can guess what
he may do. Even Cao Cao and Sun Quan fear him; how much more must we? Moreover,
we have received kindness at his hands and owe him our lives. We ought to show
our gratitude. Now let us at all risks slay this Meng Huo and submit to Zhuge
Liang so that our people may not suffer.â
Dongtu Na said, âI do not know your inner sentiments.â
At this, all those who had been prisoners and released cried with one voice,
âWe desire to go to Meng Huo.â
Thereupon Dongtu Na took in his hand a sharp sword, placed himself at the head
of more than a hundred malcontents, and rushed into the great camp. At that
moment Meng Huo was, as usual, intoxicated and lay in his tent. The mutineers
rushed in. They found two generals on guard.
âYou also received kindness from Zhuge Liang and ought to repay it,â cried
Dongtu Na.
They replied, âYou do not have to slay him. Let us carry him a prisoner to
the Prime Minister.â
So they bound the King securely, took him down to the river, and crossed in a
boat to the northern bank. There they halted, while they sent a messenger to
Zhuge Liang.
Now Zhuge Liang knew what had been happening, and he had issued orders for
every camp to prepare their weapons. All being ready, he told the chiefs to
bring up their prisoner, and bade the others return to their camps. Dongtu Na
went first and told the matter to Zhuge Liang, who praised his zeal and gave
him presents. Then he retired with the chiefs, and the executioners brought in
Meng Huo.
âYou said once before that if you were captured again, you would give in,â
said Zhuge Liang, smiling. âNow will you yield?â
âThis capture is not your work,â replied Meng Huo. âIt is the work of
these minions of mine who want to hurt me. I will not yield on this.â
âIf I free you again, what then?â
âI am a Mang, and so I am not wholly ignorant of war. If you, O Minister, let
me return to my ravines, I will muster another army and fight a decisive battle
with you. If you capture me again, then I will incline my heart and own myself
beaten and yield. I will not go back on my promise again.â
âIf you refuse to yield next time you are captured, I shall hardly pardon
you.â
At Zhuge Liangâs orders the cords were loosed and refreshments were brought
for the prisoner.
âRemember,â said Zhuge Liang, âI have never failed yet. I have never
failed to win a battle or to take a city I have assaulted. Why do you Mangs not
yield?â
Meng Huo only nodded his head; he said nothing. After the wine, Zhuge Liang and
Meng Huo rode round the camps together, and the King saw all the arrangements
and the piles of stores and heaps of weapons.
And after the inspection Zhuge Liang said, âYou are silly not to yield to me.
You see my veteran soldiers, my able generals, my stores of all kinds and war
gear. How can you hope to prevail against me? If you will yield, I will inform
the Emperor, and you shall retain your kingship, and your sons and grandsons
shall succeed as perpetual guardians of the Mang country. Do you not think it
would be well?â
Meng Huo replied, âIf I did yield, the people of my valleys would not be
content. If you release me once more, I will see to it that my own people keep
the peace and bring them round to unanimity of feeling, and then they will not
oppose any more.â
Zhuge Liang was glad, and they returned to the main camp to feast until dusk,
when Meng Huo took his leave. Zhuge Liang ordered a craft and went to see him
across River Lu.
But Meng Huoâs first act on his return to his own camp was to send one of his
people to Dongtu Naâs and Ahui Nanâs camps, and pretend to ask them to come
to meet a messenger from Zhuge Liang. When the two generals came, Meng Huo
ordered assassins who had been placed hidden to do away with the two leaders.
Their corpses were thrown into a gully. Then he sent his friends to guard the
most important strategic points, while he marched to fight a battle with Ma
Dai. But when he got near the valley, he saw no signs of the enemy.
He questioned the inhabitants, and they said, ï¿½The Shu army, with all their
stores, recrossed the river last night and joined the main body in the northern
bank.ï¿½
Meng Huo then returned to his own ravine and discussed matters with his
brother, Meng You, saying, âI know all the details of the enemyâs force
from what I saw in their camp.â
And Meng Huo gave his brother certain instructions, which Meng You at once
began to carry out. Meng You loaded a hundred men with gold and jewels and
pearls and ivory and rhinoceros horn, crossed River Lu, and was on his way to
the main camp of the Shu army, when he heard the sound of drums and a cohort
under Ma Dai poured out to stop him. Meng You did not expect to meet an enemy,
and was surprised. But Ma Dai only asked what he had come for. And when he had
heard, Meng You was detained while a message was sent to Zhuge Liang.
The messenger arrived while a council was in progress, the matter under
discussion being how to pacify the Mangs.
They announced, ï¿½The brother of Meng Huo has come bearing gifts of gold and
pearls.ï¿½
Zhuge Liang turned to Ma Su, saying, âKnow you why this man has come?â
âI dare not say plainly, but let me write it,â said Ma Su.
âWrite it, then.â
So Ma Su wrote and handed the paper to his chief, who had no sooner read it
than he clapped his hands with joy, crying, âWhat you say is exactly what I
think. But you may know I have already made arrangements for the capture of
Meng Huo.â
Then Zhao Zilong was called, and some orders were whispered into his ear. Next
Wei Yan came, and he also went off with secret orders. Wang Ping, Ma Zheng, and
Guan Suo also came, and left with particular instructions. All these things
done, the bearer of gifts was called.
Meng You came and bowed low at the door of the tent, saying, âThe brother of
my house, Meng Huo, having received great kindness at your hands in sparing his
life, feels bound to offer a paltry gift. He has presumed to collect a few
pearls and some gold and other trifling jewels by way of something to give your
soldiers. And hereafter he will send tribute to your Emperor.â
âWhere is your brother at this moment?â asked Zhuge Liang.
âHaving been the recipient of your great bounty, he has gone to the Silver
Pit Ravine to collect some treasures. He will soon return.â
âHow many soldiers have you brought?â
âOnly about a hundred. I should not dare to bring any large number. They are
just porters.â
They were brought in for Zhuge Liangâs inspection. They had blue eyes and
swarthy faces, auburn hair and purple beards. They wore earrings, their hair
was fuzzy, and they went barefoot. They were tall and powerful.
Zhuge Liang made them sit down, and bade his generals press them to drink and
treat them well and compliment them.
Meanwhile, Meng Huo was anxious about the reception that would be given to his
brother and the treatment of his gifts, so he sat in his tent expecting the
messenger at any moment. Then two men came, and he questioned them eagerly.
They said, âThe presents have been accepted, and even the porters have been
invited to drink in the tent and have been regaled with beef and flesh in
plenty. O King, your brother sends the news that all will be ready at the
second watch for the attack. He will support you from within.â
This was pleasing news, and Meng Huo prepared his thirty thousand troops ready
to march out to the camp. They were divided into three divisions.
The King called up his chieftains and notables, and said, âLet each army
carry the means of making fire, and as soon as they arrive let a light be shown
as a signal. I am coming to the main camp to capture Zhuge Liang.â
With these orders they marched, and they crossed River Lu at sunset. The King,
with a hundred generals as escort, pressed on at once toward the main camp of
Shu. They met with no opposition. They even found the main gate open, and Meng
Huo and his party rode straight in. But the camp was a desert; not a soldier
was visible.
Meng Huo rode right up to the large tent and pushed open the flap. It was
brilliantly lighted with lamps, and lying about under their light were his
brother and all his men, dead drunk. Zhuge Liang had ordered Ma Su and Lu Kai
to entertain Meng You and his men with wine and dance performances. The wine
they had been pressed to drink while the plays were going on had been heavily
drugged, and they had fallen down almost as soon as they had swallowed it. One
or two who had recovered a little could not speak: They only pointed to their
mouths.
Meng Huo then saw that he had been the simple victim of another ruse. However,
he picked up his brother and the others and started off to return to his main
army.
But as he turned, torches began to flash out and drums to beat. The Mangs were
frightened and took to their heels. But they were pursued, and the pursuing
cohort was led by Wang Ping. The King bore away to the left to escape, but
again a cohort appeared in front of him; Wei Yan was there. Meng Huo tried the
other side, and was stopped by Zhao Zilong. He was in a trap and attacked on
three sides and no fourth to escape by. He abandoned everything, making one
wild rush for the River Lu.
As he reached the river bank, he saw a bark on the river with Mang soldiers on
board. Here was safety. He hailed the boat and jumped on board as soon as it
touched the bank. No sooner had he embarked than suddenly he was seized and
bound. The boat, which Ma Dai had provided and prepared, was part of the
general plan, and the Mang soldiers therein were Ma Daiâs soldiers disguised.
Many of Meng Huoâs troops accepted the chance of surrender held out by Zhuge
Liang, who soothed them and treated them well and did not injure one of them.
The remains of the conflagration were stamped out, and in a short time Ma Dai
brought along his prisoner. At the same time Zhao Zilong led in his brother,
Meng You. Wei Yan, Ma Su, Wang Ping, and Guan Suo also brought their prisoners,
chiefs or notables, to the camp of the Prime Minister.
Zhuge Liang looked at the King and laughed.
âThat was but a shallow ruse of yours to send your brother with presents to
pretend to submit to me. Did you really think I should not see through it? But
here you are once more in my power. Now do you yield?â
âI am a prisoner owing to the gluttony of my brother and the power of your
poisonous drugs. If I had only played his part myself and left him to support
me with soldiers, I should have succeeded. I am the victim of fate and not of
my own incapacity. No, I will not yield.â
âRemember this is the third time. Why not?â said Zhuge Liang.
Meng Huo dropped his head and made no answer.
âAh, well. I will let you go once more,â said Zhuge Liang.
âO Minister, if you will let me and my brother go, we will get together our
family and clients and fight you once more. If I am caught that time, then I
will confess myself beaten to the ground, and that shall be the end.â
âCertainly I shall scarcely pardon you next time,â said Zhuge Liang. âYou
had better be careful. Diligently tackle your Book of Strategy; look over your
list of confidants. If you can apply a good plan at the proper moment, you will
not have any need for late regrets.â
Meng Huo and his brother and all the chiefs were released from their bonds.
They thanked Zhuge Liang for his clemency and went away.
By the time the released prisoners had got back to the river, the army of Shu
had crossed to the farther side and had captured the Mang defenses, the Shu
flags fluttering in the breeze. As Meng Huo passed the camp, he saw Ma Dai
sitting in state.
Ma Dai pointed his sword at the King as he passed, and said, âNext time you
are caught, you will not escape.â
When Meng Huo came to his own camp, he found Zhao Zilong in possession and all
in order. Zhao Zilong was seated beneath the large banner, with his sword
drawn, and as the King passed.
Zhao Zilong also said, âDo not presume on the kindness of the Prime Minister
because you have been generously treated.â
Meng Huo grunted and passed on. Just as he was going over the frontier hills,
he saw Wei Yan and a company drawn up on the slopes.
Wei Yan shouted, âSee to it: We have got into the inmost recesses of your
country and have taken all your defensive positions. Yet you are foolish enough
to hold out. Next time you are caught, you will be quite destroyed. There will
be no more pardons.â
Meng Huo and his company ran away with their arms over their heads. Each one
returned to his own ravine.
In the fifth moon, when the sun is fierce,
Marched the army into the wild land,
To the River Lu, bright and clear,
But deadly with miasma.
Zhuge Liang the leader cared not,
Pledged was he to subdue the south,
Thereby to repay the First Rulerâs deference with service.
Wherefore he attacked the Mangs.
Yet seven times he freed their captured king.
After the crossing of the river, the Shu soldiers were feasted.
Then Zhuge Liang addressed his officers: âI let Meng Huo see our camp the
second time he was our prisoner, because I wanted to tempt him into raiding it.
He is something of a soldier, and I dangled our supplies and resources before
his eyes, knowing he would try to burn them and that he would send his brother
to pretend to submit that thereby he could get into our camp and have a chance
to betray us. I have captured and released him three times, trying to win him
over. I do not wish to do him any harm. I now explain my policy that you may
understand I am not wasting your efforts and you are still to work your best
for the government.â
They all bowed, and one said, âO Prime Minister, you are indeed perfect in
everyone of the three gifts: Wisdom, benevolence, and valor. Not even Lu Wang
or Zhang Liang can equal you!â
Said Zhuge Liang, âHow can I expect to equal our men of old? But my trust is
in your strength, and together we shall succeed.â
This speech of their leaderâs pleased them all mightily.
In the meantime Meng Huo, upset at the three captures, hastened home to his own
Silver Pit Ravine, whence he sent trusted friends with gifts to the Eight
Nations and the Ninety-three Sees and all the Mang quarters and clans to borrow
shields and swords and warriors and braves. He got together one hundred
thousand soldiers. They all assembled on an appointed day, massing like clouds
and sweeping in like mists gathering on the mountains, each and all obeying the
commands of the King Meng Huo.
And the scouts knew it all, and they told Zhuge Liang, who said, âThis is
what I was waiting for, that the Mangs should have an opportunity of knowing
our might.â
Thereupon he seated himself in a small carriage and went out to watch.
O let our enemyâs courage glow
That our greater might may show.
The story of the campaign will be continued in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 89 ****
Zhuge Liangâs small carriage was escorted by only a few horsemen. Hearing
that a sluggish river, the West Er River, lay in the way, and having no boat,
Zhuge Liang bade the escort cut down some trees and make a raft. They did so,
but the raft sank.
So Zhuge Liang turned to Lu Kai, who said, âThere is close by a mountain
covered with bamboos. I have heard of these bamboos, and some are several spans
in girth. We can make a bridge of them for the army to cross.â
So thirty thousand soldiers were sent to the mountains, where they cut down
many thousands of bamboos, and floated them down river. Then at the narrowest
point they made a bridge a hundred spans or so in length. Next the main army
was brought down to the river and camped in line along the bank. The camp was
protected by a moat, crossed by a floating bridge, and a mud rampart. On the
south bank they constructed three large stockades so as to prepare for the
coming of the Mang soldiers.
They had not long to wait. Meng Huo was hot with rage and came quickly with an
army of one hundred thousand. As soon as he got near the river, he led out ten
thousand fierce warriors, armed with big swords and shield, and challenged the
first stockade.
Zhuge Liang went forth in simple state. He wore a silk cap and a crane-white
robe and held in his hand a feather fan. He sat in a four-horse carriage, and
his generals rode right and left.
The King of the Mang was clad in mail of rhinoceros hide and wore a bright red
casque. In his left hand he bore a shield, and his right gripped a sword. He
rode a red ox. As soon as he saw his enemies, he opened his mouth and poured
forth abuse and insults, while his warriors, huge and bold, darted to and fro
brandishing their weapons.
Zhuge Liang at once ordered the army to retire within the stockades and bar the
gates. The Mangs came close up to the stockade and pranced about naked,
shouting in derision.
Within the stockade the Shu generals grew very angry, and they went in a body
to see their leader.
They all said, ï¿½We volunteer to march out and fight until death!ï¿½
But Zhuge Liang would not listen.
Presently he said, âThese men are not submissive to the Imperial Government
and are naturally fierce and turbulent. In that mood we are no match for them.
But all we have to do is to remain on guard for a few days till their ferocity
has spent itself. Then I have a plan that will overcome them.â
Days passed, and the army of Shu made no move; they only maintained the
defensive. Zhuge Liang watched the besiegers from an eminence, and saw the
first vigor of their advance give way to careless idleness.
Then Zhuge Liang called together his generals and asked, âDare you give
battle now?â
They all rejoiced at the suggestion. So he called them two by two or one by one
and gave them secret orders. Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan went in first. Wang Ping
and Ma Zheng followed.
To Ma Dai he said, âI am going to abandon these stockades and retire north of
the river. As soon as we have crossed, you are to cut loose the floating bridge
and move it down the stream so that Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan may cross.â
To Zhang Yi he said, âYou are to remain by the camp and light it up at night
â-as if it is still occupied. When Meng Huo pursues, then you are to cut off
his retreat.â
Last of all, Guan Suo was to escort Zhuge Liangâs carriage.
The soldiers marched out of the camp at evening, and the lamps were hung up as
usual. The Mangs saw this from a distance and dared not attack. But the next
morning at dawn Meng Huo led his troops to the stockades and found all was
quiet. He went close up and saw they were all empty and bare; not a soldier was
there. Grain and fodder lay about among empty carts. All was in confusion,
suggesting hasty departure.
âThey have abandoned the camp,â said Meng You to his brother. âBut this
is only a ruse.â
Said Meng Huo, âI think that Zhuge Liang has important news from the capital
that has made him leave without his baggage train like this. Either Wu has
invaded or Wei has attacked. They left these lamps burning to make us think the
camps were occupied, but they ran away leaving everything behind. If we pursue,
we cannot go wrong.â
So the King urged his army onward, himself heading the leading division. When
they reached the bank of the West Er River, they saw on the farther side that
the camps were all in order and the banners flying as usual like a brightly
tinted cloud of silk. Along the bank stood a wall of cloth. They dared not
attack.
Meng Huo said to his brother, âThis means that Zhuge Liang fears lest we may
pursue. That is only a temporary halt, and they will retire in a couple of
days.â
The Mangs camped on the river bank while they sent into the mountains to cut
bamboos to make rafts. The boldest of the soldiers were placed in front of the
camp till the rafts should be ready to cross. Little did Meng Huo suspect that
the army of Shu was already within his borders.
One day when the wind blew violently, the Mangs saw great flames spring up
around them, and at the same time the rolling of drums heralded an attack. The
Mangs, instead of going out to meet the enemy, began to force their way out of
the Shu attack. Meng Huo became alarmed and fled with all his clans and
dependents. They fought their way through and made a dash for their former
camp.
Just as they reached it, there appeared a cohort of the enemy led by Zhao
Zilong. Meng Huo turned off west and sought refuge in the mountains. But he was
fiercely attacked by a cohort under Ma Dai. With a small remnant of followers,
he got away into a valley. Soon he saw in the west, north, and south clouds of
smoke rising and the glow of torches, so that he was forced to halt. However,
the east remained clear, and presently he fled in that direction. As he was
crossing the mouth of a gully, he noticed a few horsemen outlined against a
thick wood and saw they were escorting a small carriage. And in that carriage
sat Zhuge Liang.
Zhuge Liang laughed, and said, âSo King of the Mangs has got here! You have
been defeated. I have waited for you a long time.â
Meng Huo angrily turned to his followers and said, âThrice have I been the
victim of this manâs base wiles and have been put to shame. Now chance has
sent him across my path, and you must attack him with all your energy. Let us
cut him to pieces and those with him.â
The Mang horsemen, with Meng Huo shouting to encourage them, pushed forward in
hot haste toward the wood. But in a few moments they all stumbled and
disappeared into some pits that had been dug in the way. And just then Wei Yan
emerged from the wood. One by one the Mangs were pulled out of the pits and
bound tight with cords.
Zhuge Liang returned to his camp, where the captors of the King could bring in
their prisoner. Zhuge Liang busied himself in soothing the other Mang
prisoners. Many of the notables and chiefs of the tributaries had betaken
themselves to their own ravines and villages with their followers. Many of
those who remained came over and yielded to Shu. They were well fed and assured
of safety, and allowed to go to their own. They went off gladly enough.
By and by Zhang Yi brought up the Kingâs brother, Meng You. Zhuge Liang
reproached him for his brotherâs behavior.
âYour brother is a misguided simpleton. You ought to remonstrate with him and
persuade him to change his course. Here you are, a captive for the fourth time.
Are you not ashamed? How can you have the effrontery to look anyone in the
face?â
A deep flush of shame passed over Meng Youâs face, and he threw himself to
the earth begging forgiveness.
Zhuge Liang said, âIf I put you to death, it shall not be today. This time I
pardon you, but you are to talk to your brother.â
So Meng You was loosed from his bonds and allowed to get up. He went away
weeping.
Very soon Wei Yan brought up Meng Huo, and to him Zhuge Liang simulated great
rage, saying, âWhat can you say now? You see you are in my hands again.â
âI am again an unfortunate victim,â said Meng Huo. âOnce more I have
blundered into your net, and now I shall die with unclosed eyes.â
Zhuge Liang shouted to the lictors to take him away and behead him.
Meng Huo never blenched at the sentence, but he turned to his captor and said,
âIf you freed me only once more, I would wipe out the shame of all four
captures.â
Zhuge Liang smiled at the bold reply and bade the lictors loose his bonds, and
the attendants served him with wine. Meng Huo was invited to sit in the
commanderâs tent.
Said Zhuge Liang, âFour times you have been treated generously and yet you
are still defiant. Why?â
âThough I am what you call a barbarian, I would scorn to employ your vile
ruses. And that is why I remain defiant.â
âI have liberated you four times. Do you think you can give battle again?â
âIf you catch me again, I will incline my heart to yield and I will give
everything in my ravine to reward your army. I will also take an oath not to
cause any further trouble.â
Zhuge Liang smiled, but let him go. The King thanked him and left.
As soon as he was set at liberty, Meng Huo got together several thousand of his
adherents and went away southward. Before long he fell in with his brother,
Meng You, who had got together an army and was on his way to avenge his
brother. As soon as they saw each other, the brothers fell upon each otherâs
necks and wept. They related their experiences.
Meng You said, âWe cannot stand against the enemy. We have been defeated
several times. Now I think we had better go into the mountains and hide in some
dark gully where they cannot find us. Those soldiers of Shu will never stand
the summer heat. They must retire.â
âWhere can we hide?â asked his brother.
âI know a valley away southwest from us called âBald Dragon Ravineâ, and
the King, Duo Si, is a friend of mine. Let us take refuge with him.â
âVery well. Go and arrange it,â said Meng Huo.
So Meng You went. When he got there and talked to the chief, King Duo Si lost
no time but came out with his soldiers to welcome Meng Huo, who then entered
the valley. After the exchange of salutations, Meng Huo explained his case.
Duo Si said, âO King, rest content. If those men from the River Lands come
here, I will see to it that not one goes home. And Zhuge Liang will meet his
death here too.â
Naturally, Meng Huo was pleased. But he wanted to know how his host could feel
so secure.
Duo Si said, âIn this ravine there are only two roads, the one you came by
and another by the northwest. The road you traveled along is level and soft,
and the waters are sweet. Humans and horses may both use it. But if we close
the mouth of the ravine with a barricade, then no one, however strong, can get
in. The other road is precipitous, dangerous, and narrow. The only path is
beset with venomous serpents and scorpions, and as evening comes on there are
malarial exhalations which are dangerous till past noon the next day. The road
is only practicable between two watches before sunset. Then the water is
undrinkable. The road is very difficult.
âThen again there are four streams actually poisonous. One is called âThe
Dumb Springâ. Its water is pleasant to the palate, but it makes people dumb
and they die in a few days. A second fountain is called âThe Destruction
Springâ and is hot. But if a person bathes therein, his flesh rots till his
bones protrude and he dies. The third is âThe Black Springâ. Its water is
clear. If it be sprinkled on a personâs body, his limbs turn black and
presently he dies. The fourth is âThe Weak Springâ, ice cold. If a person
drink of this water his breath is chilled, he becomes weak as a thread and soon
dies. Neither birds nor insects are found in this region, and no one but the
Han General Ma Yuan, who was styled General Who Quells the Waves for this
exploit, has ever passed. Now the northeast road shall be blocked, and you may
hide here perfectly safe from those troops of Shu, for, finding that way
blocked, they will try the other road, which is waterless save for the four
deadly springs. No matter how many they be, they will perish, and we need no
weapons.â
âNow indeed I have found a place to live in,â cried Meng Huo, striking his
forehead. Then looking to the north he said, âEven Zhuge Liangâs wonderful
cunning will be of no avail. The four springs alone will defeat him and avenge
my army.â
The two brothers settled down comfortably as guests of King Duo Si, with whom
they spent the days in feasting.
In the meantime, as the Mangs did not appear, Zhuge Liang gave orders to leave
the West Er River and push south. It was then the sixth month, and blazing hot.
A poet sang about the bitter heat of the south:
The hills are sere, the valleys dry,
A raging heat fills all the sky,
Throughout the whole wide universe
No spot exists where heat is worse.
Another poem runs:
The glowing sun darts out fierce rays,
No cloud gives shelter from the blaze.
In parching heat there pants a crane,
The whale swims through the hissing main.
The brookâs cool margin now I love,
Or idle stroll through bamboo grove.
I would not march to deserts far
In leathern jerkin donned for war.
Just at the moment of setting out southward, the spies brought news of Meng
Huoâs retreat: âMeng Huo has fled into the Bald Dragon Ravine, and there he
has barricaded the entrance. The valley is garrisoned; the hills are
precipitous and even impassable.â
So Zhuge Liang called in Lu Kai and questioned him, but he did not know exactly
the conditions.
Then out spoke Jiang Wan, saying, âMeng Huoâs repeated captures have broken
his spirit so that he dare not take the field again. Our soldiers are exhausted
with this intense heat, and little is to be gained by prolonging the campaign.
The best move would be to return to our own country.â
âIf we do this, we shall fall victims to Meng Huoâs scheme,â said Zhuge
Liang. âIf we retreated, he would certainly follow. Beside, having advanced
so far, it would be fruitless to turn back now.â
Wang Ping was sent on with the advanced guard and some of the Mangs as guides
to seek an entrance on the northwest. They found the road and came to the first
spring â-the Dumb Spring â-, of which the thirsty men and horses drank
freely.
Wang Ping returned to report his success, but by the time he reached camp, he
and all his soldiers were speechless. They could only point to their mouths.
Zhuge Liang knew they had been poisoned, and was alarmed. He went forward in
his light chariot to find out the cause. He came to the spring. The water was
very deep and dark green. A mass of vapor hung about the surface rising and
falling. They would not touch the water. Zhuge Liang went up the hills to look
around, but could see nothing except a rampart of mountains. A deep silence
hung over all, unbroken by the cry even of a bird. He was perplexed.
Presently he noticed an old temple away up among the crags. By the aid of the
lianas and creepers he managed to clamber up, and in a chamber hewn out of the
rock he saw the figure of an officer. Beside it was a tablet saying the temple
was dedicated to Ma Yuan, the famous general who had preceded him in that
country. The natives had erected it to sacrifice to the leader who had headed
the campaign against the Mangs.
Zhuge Liang, much impressed, bowed before the image of the great leader, and
said, âYour humble servant received a sacred trust, the protection of the son
of the First Ruler. That son, the present Emperor, sent him here to subdue the
Mangs that the land might be free from peril when he decided to attack Wei and
take possession of Wu and thereby restore the glory of Han. But the soldiers
are ignorant of the country, and some of them have drunk of a poisonous spring
so that they have become dumb. Your servant earnestly prays your honored
spirit, out of regard for the kindness and justice of the present Emperor, to
reveal your spiritual character and manifest your holiness by safeguarding and
assisting the army.â
Having prayed thus, Zhuge Liang left the temple. While seeking some native whom
he might question, he saw in the distance, on a hill opposite, an aged man
leaning on a staff. He approached, and as he drew nearer, Zhuge Liang noted his
extraordinary appearance. When he had reached the temple, Zhuge Liang asked the
venerable visitor to walk in. After the salutations, the old man sat on the
stones, and Zhuge Liang opened the conversation with the usual questions.
The old gentleman replied, âSir Minister, I know you well by repute, and am
happy to meet you. Many of the Mangs owe their lives to you, and all have been
deeply impressed by your kindness.â
Then Zhuge Liang returned to the matter nearest his heart, the mystery of the
spring.
The old man told him, âThat is the Dumb Spring that your soldiers have drunk,
and they will die in a few days. Besides that, there are other three poisonous
streams called Destruction Spring, Black Spring, and Weak Spring. All miasma
gathers there in the four streams, and it only vaporizes during the two watch
before sunset.â
âIn short, the Mangs cannot be conquered,â said Zhuge Liang when the old
man had finished. âAnd Wu cannot be repressed, nor Wei overcome. And the Hans
cannot be restored. So, I fail in the task set me by my Prince: I wish that I
might die.â
âBe not so cast down, O Minister,â said the aged one. âI can lead you to
a place where you may counteract all this.â
âI would ask for your instruction, Venerable One,â said Zhuge Liang.
âWhat exalted advice have you to confer upon me? I hope you will instruct
me.â
âWest of this, not far off, is a valley, and seven miles from its entrance is
a stream called the âSpring of Eternal Peaceâ, near which there lives a
recluse known as the Hermit of the Stream. He has not left the valley these
twenty years. Behind his hut there gushes out a spring of water, called the
âSpring of Peace and Joyâ. This is the antidote to your poison. Bathing in
its waters is a cure for skin diseases and for malaria. Moreover, near the hut
grows an herb called the âgarlic-leaved fragranceâ. Chewing a leaf of this
safeguards one from malaria. You can do no better than go to the hut of the
recluse forthwith and get these remedies.â
Zhuge Liang humbly thanked his aged counselor, and said, âVenerable Sir, I am
profoundly affected by your merciful kindness and compassion. May I ask again
by what name may call you?â
The old man rose and entered the temple, saying, âI am the Spirit of this
mountain, sent by Ma Yuan to guide you.â
As he said this, he shouted at the solid rock behind the temple, and it opened
of itself and let him in.
Zhuge Liangâs astonishment was beyond words. He made another obeisance to the
Spirit of the temple and went down by the way he had come. Then he returned to
his camp.
Next day, bearing incense and gifts, Wang Ping and his stricken men went west
to the spot which the old man had indicated. They luckily found the valley and
followed its narrow road till they came to a small, farm-like enclosure, where
tall pines and lofty cypresses, luxuriant bamboos, and gorgeous flowers
sheltered a few simple huts. An exquisite perfume pervaded the whole place.
Zhuge Liang rejoiced to recognize the spot and at once knocked at the door.
A lad answered his knock, and Zhuge Liang was telling his name when the host
came out quickly, saying, âSurely my visitor is the Prime Minister of the Han
Dynasty?â
Zhuge Liang saw at the door a man with a bamboo comb holding back his hair,
grass shoes on his feet, and a robe of white girded in by a black girdle. He
had green eyes and yellowed hair.
âGreat Scholar, how did you know who I was?â said Zhuge Liang.
âHow could I not have heard of your expedition to the south?â
He invited Zhuge Liang to enter.
When they had seated themselves in their relative positions as host and guest,
Zhuge Liang said, âMy former Prince, the First Ruler, confided to me the care
of his son and successor. That son, now Emperor, gave me a command to lead an
army to this country, get the Mangs on our side, and spread our culture among
them. But now to my disappointment Meng Huo, the King, has hidden himself in
the Bald Dragon Ravine, and some of my soldiers on the way to seek him drank of
a certain fountain and are dumb. But last evening the former leader of an
expedition, Ma Yuan, manifested his sacred presence and told me that you,
Exalted Sir, had a remedy for this evil, and I pray you of your pity to give me
of the potent fluid whereby my soldiersâ lives may be saved.â
The recluse replied, âI am only a worthless old man of the wild woods and
unworthy of the visit of such as you, O Minister. The water you desire flows
out at the back of my cottage, and you may take what you will of it.â
The serving lad then showed Wang Ping and his dumb companions to the Spring of
Peace and Joy, and he dipped up the waters for them to drink. As soon as they
had drunk, they coughed up some poisoned mucus and could speak. The lad also
led the soldiers to the Spring of Eternal Peace where they could bathe.
In the cottage the recluse regaled Zhuge Liang with tea made of cypress seeds
and a conserve of pine flowers.
He also told his guest, saying, âIn this region, the lands are full of
serpents and scorpions, and the lily flowers blown into the springs by the wind
make them unfit to drink. However, if you dig wells, you will find good
water.â
Then Zhuge Liang begged some of the garlic-leaved herb as an antidote against
malaria. The recluse said the soldiers could pluck as much as they wanted. And
so everyone put a leaf in his mouth and thus became malaria-proof.
Zhuge Liang, with a low bow then begged to be told the name of his benefactor.
âI am Meng Huoâs eldest brother,â said the recluse, smiling. âMy name
is Meng Jie.â
Zhuge Liang started.
âDo not be afraid,â said the recluse. âLet me explain. We were three
brothers of the same parents, the eldest being myself. Our parents are both
dead. My brother Meng Huo, being headstrong and vicious, has never been
amenable to culture. I have talked to him many times, but he kept his own
course. Finally, under an assumed name, I retired to this spot. I am ashamed
for my brotherâs rebellion, which has put you, O Minister, to the trouble of
making this expedition into a barren country, but it has given me the privilege
of seeing you. For my responsibility in this I deserve to die a thousand times,
as I own to your face, and I beg your pardon.â
Zhuge Liang sighed, saying, âNow I believe that story of the two brothers
â-Robber Liu Zhi and Noble Liu Xiahui. This is the same thing over again.
People renowned for villainy and virtue may come from the same stock.â
Then he said to his host, âWould you wish me to represent your merits to the
Emperor and get you created a king?â
âHow can you think I desire honors or wealth when I am here because of my
contempt for all such things?â
Zhuge Liang then wished to make him certain presents, but the recluse would
have none of them.
So taking leave of his host, Zhuge Liang went back to his camp.
In the southern expedition when the Mangs were subdued,
Zhuge Liang found a high-born recluse in a shady solitude.
Up till then the gloomy forests were thought destitute of men,
That no curling smoke wreath ever floated upwards from the glen.
As soon as Zhuge Liang reached camp, he set the soldiers digging for water.
They dug to a great depth but found none; nor were they more successful when
they tried other places. They were very discouraged.
Then Zhuge Liang in the depths of the night burned incense and prayed to God:
âUnworthy as is thy servant Zhuge Liang, he has received favor from the Great
Han and now has been ordered to subdue the Mangs. Alas! Now our water is spent
and my soldiers and animals are parched with thirst. If Thy will be to preserve
the line of Hans, then give, I beseech Thee, sweet water; but if their course
is run, then may Thy servant and those with him die in this place.â
The morning after this prayer the wells were full of sweet water.
The Mangs must be conquered; Zhuge Liang led a great array,
Though his skill was superhuman, yet he held the righteous way;
As the wells gave forth sweet water when Geng Gongâs head bowed full low,
So the reverent prayers of Zhuge Liang made the lower springs to flow.
The soldiersâ spirits revived with the supply of water, and the army soon
advanced by hill paths to the Valley of the Bald Dragon, where they camped.
When Meng Huo heard the news, he was greatly taken aback.
âThese troops do not appear to have suffered either thirst or fever,â said
he. âOur springs have lost their power.â
King Duo Si heard it, but doubted. He and Meng Huo ascended into a high hill
whence they could see their enemies. They saw no signs of illness or distress.
All went on calmly and quietly in the camps, water carrying and cooking, eating
and attending to the cattle. Duo Siâs hair stood on end as he looked at them.
âThese are not human soldiers,â said he, shivering. âThey must be sent
from Heaven.â
âOur two brothers will fight one fierce battle with these troops of Shu and
die therein,â said Meng Huo, âWe cannot wait calmly to be put into
bonds.â
âBut, O King, if your army should be beaten, my whole family will also
perish. Let us encourage the people of the ravines. Let us kill bullocks and
slaughter horses to feed them, and urge them to go through fire and water to
rush right up to the camp of the enemy and seize upon victory.â
So there was great feasting before the Mangs took the field. Just as this was
going on, there arrived one Yang Fang, King of twenty-one ravines in the west,
and he led thirty thousand troops.
Meng Huo rejoiced exceedingly, saying, ï¿½This addition to our forces shall
surely bring us victory.ï¿½
So he and Duo Si went out of their own valley to welcome Yang Fang.
Yang Fang said, âI have with me thirty thousand troops in iron mail, brave
and intrepid warriors, who can fly over mountains and bound across the peaks.
They of themselves are a match for the enemy even if the enemy numbered a
hundred legions. And, moreover, my five sons, all trained in arms, are with me,
all to help you, O Kings.â
The five sons were brought in and presented. They were handsome young fellows,
bold and martial looking. Father and sons were entertained at a banquet.
Halfway through the feast Yang Fang proposed a diversion.
âThere is but scanty amusement in the field,â said Yang Fang, âand so I
have brought along some native singing girls who have been taught fencing and
such things. If you care for it, they might give an exhibition.â
The feasters hailed the suggestion with joy, and soon thirty maidens came to
the front of the tent. Their hair hung about their shoulders, and they were
barefooted. They danced and skipped and went through their performance outside.
The guests inside clapped their hands and applauded their skill, and the
soldiers joined in the choruses.
Presently, at a signal from their father, two of Yang Fangâs sons bore two
goblets to Meng Huo and Meng You. Meng Huo and Meng You took the cups and were
raising them to their lips when Yang Fang shouted a single word of command,
and, instantly, the cupbearers had the two brothers out of their seats and
helpless in their hands. At this, Duo Si jumped up to run away, but Yang Fang
gripped him, and he was a prisoner too. The Mang maidens ranged themselves in a
line along the front of the tent so that none dared approach.
âWhen the hare dies the fox mourns,â said Meng Huo. âOne sympathizes with
oneâs own as a rule. We are both chiefs and have been friends. I know not why
you should injure me.â
âI had to repay Zhuge Liang the Minister for his compassion on me and my
people, and there was no way till you rebelled. Why should I not offer up a
rebel in propitiation?â
Leaving Meng Huo, Meng You, and Duo Si in the hands of Yang Fang, the Mang
warriors dispersed, each man returning to his own valley.
Yang Fang then took the prisoners to the camp of Shu, where he bowed at the
tent door, saying, âI and my sons and the sons of my brother are grateful to
you for much kindness, wherefore we bring to you as an offering the persons of
these rebels.â
Zhuge Liang rewarded Yang Fang and bade them bring forward Meng Huo.
âThis time are you prepared to yield?â said the Prime Minister.
âIt is not your ability, but the treachery of my own people that has brought
me to this. If you wish to slay, slay. But I will not yield.â
âYou know you were the cause of my army entering into a waterless land, where
there were those four evil streams, and yet my soldiers were not poisoned and
came to no harm. Does it not seem to you like evidence of a superior protecting
power? Why will you follow this misguided road and always be obstinate?â
Meng Huo replied, âMy fathers have long held the Silver Pit Ravine, and the
three rivers and the two forests are their ramparts. If you can take that
stronghold, then will I and my heirs forever acknowledge your power and
yield.â
âI am going to liberate you once more,â said Zhuge Liang, âand you may
put your army in order if you will and fight a decisive battle. But after that,
if you are my prisoner and are still refractory and unsubmissive, I shall have
to exterminate your whole family.â
Zhuge Liang ordered the lictors to loose the prisonerâs bonds and let him go.
After he had gone, the other two, Meng You and Duo Si, were led in and they
also received their liberty. They were given wine and food. but they were
confused and could not look Zhuge Liang in the face. They were given horses to
travel on.
The way has been long and now danger is near,
But faith in their leader banishes fear.
The next chapter will tell how Meng Huo reorganized his army and whose the
victory was.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 90 ****
All the prisoners were released. Yang Fang and his sons were rewarded with
ranks, and his people were given presents. They expressed their gratitude and
returned to their own, while Meng Huo and his brother hastened home to Silver
Pit Ravine.
Outside this ravine were three rivers â-River Lu, River Gannan, and River
Xicheng. These three streams united to form the Three Rivers. Close to the
ravine on the north was a wide and fruitful plain; on the west were salt wells.
The River Lu flowed about seventy miles to the southwest, and due south was a
valley called the Liangdu Ravine. There were hills in, as well as surrounding,
the ravine, and in these they found silver â-whence the name âSilver
Pitâ.
A palace complex had been built in the ravine, which the Mang kings had made
their stronghold, and there was an ancestral temple, which they called
âFamily Spiritsâ, where they solemnized sacrifices of bulls and horses at
the four seasons. They called these sacrifices âInquiring of the Spiritsâ.
Human sacrifices were offered also, humans of Shu or of their own people
belonging to other villages. The sick swallowed no drugs, but prayed to a chief
sorcerer, called âDrug Demonâ. There was no legal code, the only punishment
for every transgression being death.
When girls were grown and became women, they bathed in a stream. Men and women
were kept separate, and they married whom they willed, the parents having no
control in that particular. There was no formal vocational training. In good
seasons the country produced grain, but if the harvest failed, they would make
soup out of serpents and eat boiled elephant flesh.
All over the country the head of the family of greatest local consideration was
termed âKing of the Ravineâ, and the next in importance was called a
âNotableâ. A market was held in the city of Three Rivers, on the first day
of every moon, and another on the fifteenth. Goods were brought in and
bartered.
In his own ravine, Meng Huo gathered his family and clan to the number of a
thousand or more and addressed them: âI have been put to shame by the leaders
of Shu many times, and I have sworn to take revenge for the insults. Has anyone
any proposal to make?â
Thereupon a certain one replied, saying, âI can produce a man able to defeat
Zhuge Liang.â
The assembly turned to the speaker, who was a brother of Meng Huoâs wife. He
was the head of eight tribes of the Southern Mangs, and was named Chief Dai
Lai.
âWho is the man?â asked Meng Huo.
Chief Dai Lai replied, âHe is Mu Lu, King of the Bana Ravine. He is a master
of witchcraft who can call up the wind and invoke the rain. He rides upon an
elephant and is attended by tigers, leopards, wolves, venomous snakes, and
scorpions. Beside, he has under his hand thirty thousand superhuman soldiers.
He is very bold. O King, write him a letter and send him presents, which I will
deliver. If he will consent to lend his aid, what fear have we of Shu?â
Meng Huo was pleased with the scheme and ordered Dai Lai to draft a letter.
Then he ordered Duo Si to defend Three Rivers and make the first line of
defense.
Zhuge Liang led his troops near the city of Three Rivers. Taking a survey of
the country, he noted that the city was surrounded by the three rivers and
could only be reached by a bank on one face, so he sent Wei Yan and Zhao Zilong
to march along the road and attack. But when they reached the rampart, they
found it well defended by bows and crossbows.
The defenders of the city were adepts in the use of the crossbow, and they had
one sort which discharged ten arrows at once. Furthermore, the arrows were
poisoned, and a wound meant certain death. The two generals saw that they could
not succeed, and so retired.
When Zhuge Liang heard of the poisoned arrows, he mounted his light chariot and
went to see for himself. Having regarded the defenses, he returned to his camp
and ordered a retirement of three miles. This move delighted the Mangs, who
congratulated each other on their success in driving off the besiegers, who, as
they concluded, had been frightened away. So they gave themselves up to
rejoicing and kept no watch. Nor did they even send out scouts.
The army of Shu made a strong camp in their new halting place and closed the
gates for defense. For five days they gave no sign. One evening, just at
sunset, a slight breeze began to blow.
Then Zhuge Liang issued an order: âEvery man should provide himself with a
coat by the first watch. If anyone lacks, he will be put to death.â
None of the generals knew what was in the wind, but the order was obeyed. Next,
each man was ordered to fill his coat with earth. This order appeared equally
strange, but it was carried out.
When all were ready, they were told: âYou are to carry the earth to the foot
of the city wall, and the first arrivals will be rewarded.â
So they ran with all speed with the dry earth and reached the wall. Then with
the earth they were ordered to make a raised way, and the first soldier on the
wall was promised a reward.
The whole of the one hundred thousand troops of Shu, and their native allies,
having thrown their burdens of earth near the wall, then quickly rushed up the
incline, and with one great shout were on the wall. The archers on the wall
were seized and dragged down. Those who got clear ran away into the city. King
Duo Si was slain in the melee that followed on this attack. The soldiers of Shu
moved through the city slaying all they met. Thus was the city captured and
with it great booty of jewels, which were made over to the army as a reward for
their prowess.
The few soldiers who escaped went away and told Meng Huo: ï¿½The city of Three
Rivers was lost, and King Duo Si slain!ï¿½
Meng Huo was much distressed. Before he had recovered, they told him: ï¿½The
army of Shu has come over and is encamped at the mouth of Silver Pit Ravine.ï¿½
Just as he was in the very depths of distress, a laugh came from behind the
screen.
A woman appeared, saying, âThough you are brave, how silly you are! Though I
am a woman, but I want to go out and fight.â
The woman was his wife, Lady Zhurong. She was a descendant of the Zhurong
family of the Southern Mang. She was expert in the use of the flying sword and
never missed her aim.
Meng Huo rose and bowed to her. Lady Zhurong thereupon mounted a horse and
forthwith marched out at the head of a hundred generals, leading fifty thousand
troops of the ravines, and set out to drive off the troops of Shu.
Just as the host got clear of the Silver Pit Palace, it was stopped by a cohort
led by Zhang Ni. At once the Mangs deployed, and the lady leader armed herself
with five swords such as she used. In one hand she held an eighteen-foot signal
staff, and she sat a curly-haired, reddish horse.
Zhang Ni was secretly troubled at the sight before him, but he engaged the lady
commander. After a few passes the lady turned her steed and bolted. Zhang Ni
went after her, but a sword came flying through the air directly at him. He
tried to fend off with one hand, but it wounded his arm, and he fell to the
ground. The Mangs gave a loud shout; some of them pounced on the unlucky leader
and made him prisoner.
Then Ma Zheng, hearing his comrade had been taken, rushed out to rescue, but
only to be surrounded. He saw the lady commander holding up her staff and made
a dash forward, but just then the Mangs threw hooks and pulled down his steed,
and he was also a prisoner.
Both generals were taken into the ravine and led before the King. He gave a
banquet in honor of his wifeâs success, and during the feast the lady bade
the lictors put the two prisoners to death. They hustled the two generals in
and were just going to carry out their orders when Meng Huo checked them.
âNo! Five times has Zhuge Liang set me at liberty. It would be unjust to put
these to death. Confine them till we have taken their chief, then we may
execute them.â
His wife was merry with wine and did not object. So their lives were spared.
The defeated soldiers returned to their camp. Zhuge Liang took steps to
retrieve the mishap by sending for Ma Dai, Zhao Zilong, and Wei Yan, to each of
whom he gave special and private orders.
Next day the Mang soldiers reported to the King that Zhao Zilong was offering a
challenge. Lady Zhurong forthwith mounted and rode out to battle. She engaged
Zhao Zilong, who soon fled. The lady was too prudent to risk pursuit, and rode
home. Then Wei Yan repeated the challenge, and he also fled as if defeated. But
again the lady declined to pursue. Next day Zhao Zilong repeated his challenge
and ran away as before. Lady Zhurong signaled no pursuit. But at this Wei Yan
rode up and opened a volley of abuse and obloquy. This proved too much, and she
gave the signal to go after him and led the way. Wei Yan increased his pace,
and the lady commander doubled hers, and she and her followers pressed into a
narrow road along a valley. Suddenly behind her was heard a noise, and Wei Yan,
turning his head, saw the lady tumble out of her saddle.
She had rushed into an ambush prepared by Ma Dai: Her horse had been tripped up
by ropes. She was captured, bound, and carried off to the Shu camp. Some of her
people endeavored to rescue her, but they were driven off.
Zhuge Liang seated himself in his tent to see his prisoner, and Lady Zhurong
was led up. He bade them remove her bonds, and she was conducted to another
tent, where wine was laid before her. Then a message was sent to Meng Huo to
say that she would be exchanged for the two captive leaders.
The King agreed, and Ma Zheng and Zhang Ni were set free. As soon as they
arrived, the lady was escorted by Zhuge Liang himself to the mouth of the
ravine, where Meng Huo welcomed her both gladly and angrily.
Then they told Meng Huo of the coming of the King of the Bana Ravine, and he
went out to meet Mu Lu. Mu Lu rode up on his white elephant, dressed in silks,
and with many gold and pearl ornaments. He wore a double sword at his belt, and
he was followed by the motley pack of fighting animals that he fed, gamboling
and dancing about him.
Meng Huo made him a low obeisance and then poured out his tale of woes. Mu Lu
promised to avenge his wrongs and was led off to a banquet which had been
prepared.
Next day the deliverer went out to battle, with his pack of wild creatures in
his train. Zhao Zilong and his colleague Wei Yan quickly made their array of
footmen and then took their station in front side by side and studied their
opponents. The Mang banners and weapons were all extraordinary. Most of the
warriors wore no armor and none wore any clothing. Their faces were sunburned.
They carried four sharp pointed knives in their belts. Signals were not given
by drum or trumpet, but by a gong.
King Mu Lu had two swords in his belt and carried a hand bell. He urged his
white elephant forward and emerged from between his flags.
âWe have spent all our life in the battlefields, but we have never seen the
like of this before,â said Zhao Zilong.
As they talked to one another, they noticed that the opposing leader was
mumbling something that might be a spell or a curse, and from time to time he
rang his bell. Then suddenly the wind got up, stones began to roll and sand to
fly, and there was a sound as of a heavy shower of rain. Next a horn rang out,
and thereupon the tigers and the leopards, and the wolves and the serpents, and
all the other wild beasts came down on the wind snapping and clawing. How could
the soldiers of Shu stand such a thing as that? So they retreated, and the
Mangs came after them fiercely, chasing and slaying their enemies as far as the
city of Three Rivers.
Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan mustered their defeated troops and went to their leader
to confess their failure. Zhuge Liang, however, was neither angry nor dejected.
âThe fault is not yours,â he said. âLong ago, when I was still in my
rustic hut, I knew the Mangs possessed certain powers over beasts, and I
provided against this adventure before we left Shu. You will find twenty big
sealed carts in the baggage train. We will use half of them now.â
He bade his staff bring forward ten of the red box-carts; the other ten black
carts were left untouched. They all wondered what would happen. Then the carts
were opened, and they turned out to be carved and colored models of huge wild
beasts, with coats of worsted, teeth and claws of steel; each could accommodate
ten people. Choosing one hundred beasts, he told off a thousand troops and bade
them stuff the mouths of the beasts full of inflammables.
Next day the army of Shu marched out to the attack and were arrayed at the
entrance to the Silver Pit Ravine. The Mang soldiers went into the ravine and
told their king. Mu Lu, thinking himself perfectly invincible, did not
hesitate, but marched out, taking Meng Huo with him. Zhuge Liang, dressed in
the simple robe of a Daoist, went out in his light chariot. In his hand he held
a feather fan. Meng Huo, who recognized his enemy, pointed him out to Mu Lu.
âThat is Zhuge Liang in that small chariot. If we can only capture him, our
task is done.â
Then Mu Lu began to mutter his spells and to ring his bell. As before, the wind
got up and blew with violence, and the wild beasts came on.
But at a wave of the simple feather fan, lo! the wind turned and blew the other
way. Then from out of the host of Shu there burst the horrible wild beasts. The
real wild beasts of the Mang saw rushing down upon them huge creatures, whose
mouths vomited flames and whose nostrils breathed out black smoke. They came
along with jingling bells, snapping and clawing, and the real beasts turned
tail and fled in among the host of their own side, trampling them down as they
sped. Zhuge Liang gave the signal for a general onset, and his troops rushed
forward with beating drums and blaring trumpets. Mu Lu was killed in the melee.
Meng Huoâs whole clan fled in panic and tore up among the hills out of the
way. And thus the Silver Pit Ravine was taken.
Next day, as Zhuge Liang was telling off parties to search for and capture the
King, it was announced that the brother-in-law of Meng Huo, Chief Dai Lai,
having vainly tried to persuade the King to yield, had made prisoners of him
and his wife and all his clan and were bringing them to Zhuge Liang.
Hearing this, Zhang Ni and Ma Zheng were called and received certain orders,
upon which they hid themselves in the wings of the tent with a large body of
sturdy warriors. This done, Zhuge Liang ordered the keepers to open the gates,
and in came Chief Dai Lai with Meng Huo and his people in custody.
As Dai Lai bowed at the entrance of the hall, Zhuge Liang called out, âLet my
strong captors appear!â
At once out came the hidden men, and every two of them laid hands upon a
prisoner and bound him.
âDid you think your paltry ruse would deceive me?â said Zhuge Liang.
âHere you are a second time captured by your own people and brought before me
that you might surrender. The first time I did not hurt you. But now I firmly
believe this surrender is part of a plot to kill me.â
Then he called out to his guards to search the prisoners. They did so, and on
every man they found a sharp knife.
âDid you not say that if your family were taken prisoners you would yield?
How now?â said Zhuge Liang.
âWe have come of our own will and at the risk of our lives. The credit is not
yours. Still I refuse to yield,â replied Meng Huo.
âThis is the sixth time I have captured you, and yet you are obstinate. What
do you expect?â
âIf you take me a seventh time, then I will turn to you and never rebel
again.â
âWell, your stronghold is now destroyed. What have I to fear?â said Zhuge
Liang.
He ordered the bonds to be loosed, saying, âIf you are caught again and lie
to me once more, I shall certainly not be inclined to let you off.â
Meng Huo and his people put their hands over their heads and ran off like rats.
The defeated Mangs who had fled were of thousands, and more than half of them
were wounded. They fell in with their King, who restored what order was
possible and felt glad that he had still some leaders left. Then he and the
Chief Dai Lai took counsel together.
âWhither can we go?â said Meng Huo. âOur stronghold is in the hands of
the enemy.â
Dai Lai replied, âThere is but one country that can overcome these troops.
That is the Wuguo Kingdom. It lies two hundred miles to the southeast. The King
of that state is named Wutu Gu. He is a giant of twelve spans. He does not eat
grain, but lives on serpents and venomous beasts. He wears scaly armor, which
is impenetrable to swords and arrows. His warriors wear rattan armor. This
rattan grows in gullies, climbing over rocks and walls. The inhabitants cut the
rattans and steep them in oil for half a year. Then they are dried in the sun.
When dry they are steeped again, and so on many times. Then they are plaited
into helmets and armor. Clad in this, the men float across rivers, and it does
not get wet. No weapon can penetrate it. The soldiers are called the Rattan
Army. You may seek aid from this king, and with his help you can take Zhuge
Liang as easily as a sharp knife cleaves a bamboo.â
Meng Huo went to the Wuguo Kingdom and saw the King. The people of this country
do not live in houses, but dwell in caves. Meng Huo told the story of his woes.
And King Wutu Gu said, ï¿½I shall muster all my men to avenge you.ï¿½
Meng Huo bowed low and expressed great gratitude.
Wutu Gu called up two generals named Xi Ni and Tu An and gave them thirty
thousand of the rattan-armored soldiers and bade them march northeast.
They came to a river called the River of Peach Flowers, on both banks of which
grow many peach trees. Year after year the leaves of these trees fall into the
river and render it poisonous to all but the natives. But to the natives it is
a stimulant which doubles their vigor. They camped on the bank of this river to
await the coming of the army of Shu.
Now Zhuge Liang was informed of the journey of Meng Huo and its results, and he
knew when the rattan-clad army camped at the ford. He also knew that Meng Huo
had collected all the soldiers of his own that he could help. Zhuge Liang at
once marched to the ford. He questioned the natives, and they told him that the
peach leaves were falling and the water of the river was undrinkable. So he
retired two miles and camped. Only Wei Yan was left to hold the bank of the
River of Peach Flowers.
Next day Wutu Gu led the Wuguo warriors across the stream, and, with a rolling
of drums, Wei Yan went out to meet them. The Wuguo men poured forth. The
soldiers of Shu shot at them, but neither arrows nor bolts penetrated their
armors; they rolled off harmless. Nor could swords cut or spears enter. The
enemy, thus protected and armed with big swords and prongs, were too much for
the troops of Shu, who had to run away. However, they were not pursued. When,
on the retreat, they came to the Peach Flowers Ford, they saw the Mangs
crossing as if walking on the water. Some of them were tired, so they took off
their rattan breastplates, sat upon them and floated to the other side.
When Zhuge Liang heard the report of his general, he summoned Lu Kai and called
in some natives.
Lu Kai said, âI have heard of the Wuguo Kingdom as perfectly tribal among the
Mang nations. I have also heard of the rattan armor, which can withstand all
thrusts, and the harmful River of Peach Flowers. The Southern Mangs are so
untameable that victory will mean little. We would rather retreat.â
âNo, no,â said Zhuge Liang merrily, âwe have had too much difficulty in
getting here to go back so easily. I shall have a counter-plan for these people
tomorrow.â
Having provided for the defense of his camp, he gave strict orders to his
generals not to go out to fight, Zhuge Liang went to reconnoiter. He rode in
his light chariot with a few natives as guides. He came to the ford, and from a
secluded spot in the mountains on the north bank, he looked about him.
The whole country was mountainous and difficult, impassable for any carriage.
So he got out and went afoot. Presently, from a hill he saw a long winding
valley, like a huge serpent. The sides were very precipitous and bare. However,
a road ran through the middle.
âWhat is the name of the valley?â asked Zhuge Liang.
âIt is called âCoiled Serpent Valleyâ,â said the guides. âAt the
other end you come into the high road to Three Rivers. The road goes by a
valley called âTalang Seeâ.â
âThe very thing,â said Zhuge Liang gladly. âSurely this is providence. I
shall score a great success here.â
Having seen enough, he retraced his steps, found his chariot, and returned to
camp. Arrived at the camp, Ma Dai was called and put in charge of the
preparations.
Zhuge Liang gave him an order: âI will give you the ten black painted carts,
and you are to get a thousand long bamboo poles. Open the carts, and follow my
instructions there. Then you are to keep the two ends of the Coiled Serpent
Valley. Half a month is the deadline, and all of these must be performed with
the most perfect secrecy under military law and punishment.â
Next Zhao Zilong was sent to a point on the Three Rivers road; Wei Yan to camp
at the Peach Flowers Ford.
Zhuge Liang told Wei Yan, âIf the Mangs come over the river, you are to
abandon the camp and march toward a certain white flag you will see. Further,
in half a month you would have to acknowledge defeat some fifteen times and
abandon seven camps. On no account are you to come to interview me even after
fourteen defeats.â
Wei Yan went off, not a little hipped at the prospect, but prepared to obey.
Next, Zhang Yi was sent to make a stockade at a certain indicated point, and
Zhang Ni and Ma Zheng was told to lead the Mang soldiers who had surrendered,
and other orders were given.
Meng Huo had begun to have a real terror of Zhuge Liang, and he warned King
Wutu Gu of Wuguo, saying, âThis Zhuge Liang is exceedingly crafty. Ambush is
one of his favorite ruses, so you should warn your soldiers that on no account
should they enter a valley where the trees are thick.â
âGreat King, you speak with reason,â said Wutu Gu. âI have always heard
that the people of the Middle Kingdom are full of wiles, and I will see that
your advice is followed. I will go in front to fight, and you may remain in the
rear to give orders.â
Presently the scouts told them of the arrival of the troops of Shu on the bank
of the Peach Flowers River. Wutu Gu sent his two generals â-Xi Ni and Tu An
â-to cross the river and engage them. The two sides met, but Wei Yan soon
suffered a defeat and left the field. The Mangs were afraid to pursue as they
dreaded an ambush.
In the meantime, Wei Yan laid out another camp. The Mangs crossed the river in
greater force. Wei Yan came out to meet them, but again fled after a very short
fight. This time the Mangs pursued, but having lost their hold of the enemy
after three miles, and coming then to the late camp of the Shu army, which
seemed quite safe, they occupied it.
Next day Xi Ni and Tu An asked their King Wutu Gu to come to the camp, and they
reported what had happened. Wutu Gu decided to make a general advance to drive
the troops of Shu before him. They fled, even casting aside their breastplates
and throwing away their arms; they were in such haste to flee. And the troops
of Shu went toward a white flag that appeared in the distance. They found a
camp already made, which they occupied.
Soon, however, Wutu Gu came near, and as he pressed forward Wei Yan abandoned
this camp and fled. When the Mangs reached the camp, they took up quarters
therein.
Soon after they set out to renew the pursuit, but Wei Yan turned back and
checked them. This was only a temporary check, for he fled after three
encounters, going toward a white flag in the distance.
This sort of thing continued daily until the soldiers of Shu had been defeated
and driven out of the field fifteen times and had abandoned their camp on seven
different occasions.
The Mangs were now hot in pursuit and pressed on with all their might, Wutu Gu
being in the forefront of the pursuers. But then they came to a thick
umbrageous wood, and he halted, for he saw flags moving about behind the
sheltering trees.
âJust as you foretold,â said Wutu Gu to Meng Huo. âThe men of Shu like
using ambush.â
âYes. Zhuge Liang is going to be worsted this time. We have beaten off his
troops now daily for half a month and won fifteen successive victories. His
troops simply run when they hear the wind. The fact is he has exhausted all his
craft and has tried every ruse. Now our task is nearly done.â
Wutu Gu was greatly cheered and began to feel contempt for his enemy.
The sixteenth day of the long fight found Wei Yan leading his oft-defeated
troops once more against the rattan-protected foe. King Wutu Gu on his white
elephant was well in the forefront. He had on a cap with symbols of the sun and
moon and streamers of wolfâs beard, a fringed garment studded with gems,
which allowed the plates or scales of his cuirass to appear, and his eyes
seemed to flash fire. He pointed the finger of scorn at Wei Yan and began to
revile him.
Wei Yan whipped up his steed and fled. The Mangs pressed after him. Wei Yan
made for the Coiled Serpent Valley, for he saw a white flag calling him
thither. Wutu Gu followed in hot haste, and as he saw only bare hills without a
sign of vegetation, he felt quite confident that no ambush was laid. So he
followed into the valley. There he saw some score of black painted carts in the
road.
The soldiers said to each other, âThe carts must be the commissariat wagons
of the enemy, abandoned in their hasty flight when they heard of the coming of
Your Majesty.â
This only urged the King to greater speed, and he went on toward the other
mouth of the valley, for the soldiers of Shu had disappeared. However, he saw
piles of timber being tumbled down across the track and great boulders rolled
down the hill side into the road. The pursuers cleared away the obstacles. When
they had done so and advanced a little, they saw certain wheeled vehicles in
the road, some large, some small, laden with wood and straw, which was burning.
Wutu Gu was suddenly frightened and ordered a retreat.
But he heard much shouting in the rear, and they told him: âThe exit has been
blocked with wood-laden carts, which on being broken open are found to contain
explosive, and they are all on fire.â
However, seeing that the valley was barren and devoid of grass and wood, Wutu
Gu was not in the least alarmed and merely bade his soldiers search for a way
round.
Then he saw torches being hurled down the mountain side. These torches rolled
till they came to a certain spot, where they ignited the fuses leading to the
powder. Then the ground suddenly heaved with the explosion of bombs beneath.
The whole valley was soon full of flames, darting and playing in all
directions, and wherever they met with rattan armor the rattan caught fire, and
thus the whole army, huddled and crowded together, burned in the midst of the
valley.
Zhuge Liang looked on from the heights above and saw the Mangs burned. Many of
the dead had been mangled and torn by the explosions of the mines. The air was
full of suffocating vapor.
Zhuge Liangâs tears fell fast as he saw the slaughter, and he sighed, saying,
âThough I am rendering great service to my country, yet I have sacrificed
many lives. My life shall be shortened for this.â
Those who were with him were also deeply affected.
King Meng Huo was in his camp awaiting news of success when he saw a crowd of
Mang soldiers come along, and they bowed before him and told him, âKing Wutu
Gu is fighting a great battle and is about to surround Zhuge Liang in the
Valley of the Coiled Serpent. But he needs help. We are the natives of the
local ravines, and we ourselves had no alternative when we yielded to Shu. But
now we have returned to your allegiance and are willing to come to help Your
Majesty.â
So Meng Huo placed himself at the head of his clansmen and those who had just
come to him, and lost no time in marching out. He bade them lead him to the
spot. But when he reached the valley and saw the destruction, he knew he had
been made a victim again. As he made to retire, there appeared a body of his
enemy on each side under Zhang Ni and Ma Zheng, and they began to attack. Meng
Huo was making what stand he could when a great shouting arose. The Mangs were
nearly all disguised soldiers of Shu, and they quickly surrounded him and his
clansmen to make them prisoners.
Meng Huo galloped clear and got into the hills. Presently he fell upon a small
chariot, with a few guards about it, and therein sat Zhuge Liang, simply
dressed and holding a fan.
âWhat now, rebel Meng Huo?â cried Zhuge Liang.
But Meng Huo had galloped away. He was soon stopped by Ma Dai and lay a
helpless prisoner bound hand and foot. His wife, Lady Zhurong, and the other
members of his family were also taken.
Zhuge Liang returned to camp and seated himself in the high place in his own
tent. He was still sad at the thought of the sacrifice of life.
He said to his officers, âThere was no help for it; I had to use that plan.
But it has sadly injured my inner virtue. Guessing that the enemy would suspect
an ambush in every thicket, I sent people to walk about in wooded places with
flags. Really there was no ambush. I bade Wei Yan lose battle after battle just
to lead the enemy on and harden their hearts. When I saw the Valley of the
Coiled Serpent, with its bare sides of smooth rock and the road in its depths,
I recognized what could be done and sent Ma Dai to arrange the contents of the
black carts, the mines, which I had prepared long ago for this purpose. In
every bomb were nine others, and they were buried thirty paces apart. They were
connected by fuses laid in hollow bamboos that they might explode in
succession, and the force was enormous. Zhao Zilong prepared those carts laden
with straw and rolled down the piles of timber and boulders that blocked the
mouth. Wei Yan led Wutu Gu on and on till he had enticed the King into the
valley, when he took up a position to escape. Then the burning began. They say
that what is good for water is not much good for fire, and the oil-soaked
rattan, excellent as a protection against swords and arrows, was most
inflammable, catching fire at sight. The Mangs were so stubborn that the only
way was to use fire, or we should never have scored a victory. But I much
regret that the destruction of the people of Wuguo has been so complete. Heaven
shall not overlook this wrong.â
The officers were deeply moved.
Then Meng Huo was summoned. He appeared and fell upon his knees. His limbs were
freed from the bonds, and he was sent into a side tent for refreshment. The
chief prisoners were Meng Huo, Lady Zhurong, Meng You, and Dai Lai. There were
many of his clan as well.
As they were eating and drinking, a messenger appeared in the door of the tent
and addressed the King: âThe Prime Minister is ashamed and does not wish to
see you again, Sir. He has sent me to release you. You may enlist another army
if you can and once more try a decisive battle. Now you may go.â
But instead of going Meng Huo began to weep.
âSeven times a captive and seven times released!â said the King. âSurely
there was never anything like it in the whole world. I am not entirely devoid
of a sense of propriety and rectitude. Does he think that I feel no shame?â
Thereupon he and all his followers fell upon their knees and crawled to the
tent of the Commander-in-Chief and begged pardon, saying, âO Minister, you
are the majesty of Heaven. We people of the south will offer no more
opposition.â
âThen you yield?â said Zhuge Liang, sighing.
âI and my children and grandchildren are deeply affected by your all-
pervading and life-giving mercy. Now how can we not yield?â
Zhuge Liang asked Meng Huo to come up into the tent and be seated, and he
prepared a banquet of felicitation. Also he confirmed Meng Huo in his kingship
and restored all the places that had been captured. Everyone was overwhelmed
with Zhuge Liangâs generosity, and they all went away rejoicing. A poem has
praised Zhuge Liangâs action:
He rode in his chariot green,
In his hand just a feather fan,
Seven times he released a king
As part of his conquering plan.
Having chosen a beautiful spot
Where the valleys debauch on the plain,
Lest his kindness should ever be forgot,
The vanquished erected a fane.
High Counselor Fei Yi ventured to remonstrate with Zhuge Liang on his policy.
He said, âYou, O Minister, have led the army this long journey into the wilds
and have reduced the Mang country, and have brought about the submission of the
king. Why not appoint officials to share in the administration and hold the
land?â
Zhuge Liang replied, âThere are three difficulties. To leave foreigners
implies leaving a guard for them: There is the difficulty of feeding the guard.
The Mangs have lost many of their relatives. To leave foreigners without the
guard will invite a calamity: This is the second difficulty. Among the Mangs,
dethronements and murders are frequent, and there will be enmities and
suspicions. Foreigners and they will be mutually distrustful: This is the third
difficulty. If I do not leave our people, I shall not have to send supplies,
which makes for peace and freedom from trouble.â
They had to agree that the policy was wise.
The kindness of the conqueror was rewarded by the gratitude of these southern
people, and they even erected a shrine in his honor, where they sacrificed at
the four seasons. As Zhuge Liang and Meng Huo declared peace, the joy spread to
all ravines and villages. And the people sent gifts of jewels, cinnabar,
lacquer, medicines, plowing cattle, and chargers for the use of the army. And
they pledged themselves not to rebel.
When the feastings to the soldiers were finished, the army marched homeward to
Shu. Wei Yan was in command of the advanced column. He marched to the River Lu.
But on his arrival the clouds gathered and a gale blew over the face of the
waters. Because of the force of the gale, the army could not advance. Wei Yan
then returned and reported the matter to his chief. Zhuge Liang called in Meng
Huo to ask what this might mean.
The Mangs beyond the border have yielded now at last,
The water demons raging mad wonât let the Shu men go past.
The next chapter will contain Meng Huoâs explanation.
