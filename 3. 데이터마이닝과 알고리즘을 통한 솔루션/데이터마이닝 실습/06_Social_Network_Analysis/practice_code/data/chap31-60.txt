**** Chapter 31 ****
Cao Cao lost no time in taking advantage of Yuan Shaoâs flight, but smote
hard at the retreating army. Yuan Shao without helmet or proper dress, and with
few followers, crossed hastily to the north bank at Liyang. He was met by one
of his generals, Jiang Yiqu, who took him in and comforted him and listened to
the tale of misfortunes. Next Jiang Yiqu called in the scattered remnants of
the army, and when the soldiers heard that their old lord was alive they
swarmed to him like ants, so that Yuan Shao quickly became strong enough to
attempt the march to Jizhou. Soon the army set out and at night halted at Huang
Hills.
That evening, sitting in his tent, Yuan Shao seemed to hear a far off sound of
lamentation. He crept out quietly to listen and found it was his own soldiers
telling each other tales of woe. This one lamented an elder brother lost, that
one grieved for his younger brother abandoned, a third mourned a companion
missing, a fourth, a relative cut off. And each beat his breast and wept.
And all said, âHad he but listened to Tian Feng, we had not met this
disaster!â
Yuan Shao, very remorseful, said, âI did not hearken unto Tian Feng, and now
my soldiers have been beaten and I was nearly lost. How can I return and look
him in the face?â
Next day the march was resumed, and Yuan Shao met Peng Ji with reinforcements,
to whom he said, âI disregarded Tian Fengâs advice and have brought myself
to defeat. Now shall I be greatly ashamed to look him in the face.â
This tribute to Tian Fengâs prescience roused the jealousy of Peng Ji, who
replied, âYes. When he heard the news of your defeat, though he was a
prisoner, he clapped his hands for joy and said, âIndeed, just as I
foretold!ââ
âHow dare he laugh at me, the blockhead? Assuredly he shall die!â said Yuan
Shao.
Whereupon Yuan Shao wrote a letter and sent therewith a sword to slay the
prisoner.
Meanwhile Tian Fengâs gaoler came to him one day, saying, âAbove all humans
I felicitate you.â
âWhat is the joyful occasion and why felicitate?â said Tian Feng.
The gaoler replied, âImperial Protector Yuan Shao has been defeated and is on
his way back. He will treat you with redoubled respect.â
âNow am I a dead man!â said Tian Feng.
âWhy say you that, Sir, when all people give you joy?â
âThe Imperial Protector appears liberal, but he is jealous and forgetful of
honest advice. Had he been victorious, he might have pardoned me. Now that he
has been defeated and put to shame, I may not hope to live.â
But the gaoler did not believe Tian Feng. Before long came the letter and the
sword with the fatal order.
The gaoler was dismayed, but the victim said, âI knew all too well that I
should have to die.â
The gaoler wept.
Tian Feng said, âAn able person born into this world who does not recognize
and serve the right lord is ignorant. Today I die, but I am not deserving of
pity.â
Whereupon he cut his throat in the prison.
Ju Shou but yesterday was killed,
Tian Feng ends his life his fate fulfilled;
The Yellow Riverâs main beams break one by one,
Mourn ye that Yuan House! Its day is done.
Thus died Tian Feng, pitied of all who heard of his fate.
When Yuan Shao came home in Jizhou, he was with troubled mind and distorted
thoughts. He could not attend to the business of government and became so ill
that his second wife, who came of the Liu family and had replaced the first
wife after her death, besought him to make his last dispositions.
Now three sons had been born to Yuan Shao: Yuan Tan the eldest, who was the
Commander of Qingzhou; Yuan Xi, who ruled over Youzhou; and Yuan Shang, borne
to him by Lady Liu. This youngest son was very handsome and noble looking, and
his fatherâs favorite. So he was kept at home.
After the defeat at Guandu, the ladâs mother was constantly urging that her
son should be named as successor, and Yuan Shao called together four of his
counselors to consider this matter. These four happened to be divided in their
sympathies: Shen Pei and Peng Ji being in favor of the youngest son, and Xin
Ping and Guo Tu supporters of the eldest.
When they met to consult, Yuan Shao said, âAs there is nought but war and
trouble outside our borders, it is necessary that tranquillity within be early
provided for, and I wish to appoint my successor. My eldest son is hard and
cruel, my second is mild and unfit. The third has the outward form of a hero,
appreciates the wise, and is courteous to his subordinates. I wish him to
succeed, but I wish that you tell me your opinions.â
Guo Tu said, âYuan Tan is your first born, and he is in a position of
authority beyond your control. If you pass over the eldest in favor of the
youngest, you sow the seeds of turbulence. The prestige of the army has been
somewhat lowered and enemies are on our border. Should you add to our weakness
by making strife between father and son, elder and younger brothers? Rather
consider how the enemy may be repulsed and turn to the question of the heirship
later.â
Then the natural hesitation of Yuan Shao asserted itself, and he could not make
up his mind. Soon came news that his sons Yuan Tan was coming from Qingzhou
with sixty thousand troops, Yuan Xi coming from Youzhou with fifty thousand
troops, and his nephew Gao Gan coming from Bingzhou with fifty thousand troops
to help him, and he turned his attention to preparations for fighting Cao Cao.
When Cao Cao drew up his victorious army on the banks of Yellow River, the aged
natives brought an offering of food and sauce to bid him welcome. Their
venerable and hoary appearances led Cao Cao to treat them with the highest
respect.
He invited them to be seated and said to them, âVenerable Sirs, what may be
your age?â
âWe are nearly a hundred,â replied the old villagers.
âI should be very sorry if my army had disturbed your village,â said Cao
Cao.
One of them said, âIn the days of the Emperor Huan a yellow star was seen
over by way of the ancient states of Chu and Song in the southwest. Yin Kui of
Liaodong, who was learned in astrology, happened to be passing the night here,
and he told us that the star foretold the arrival in these parts, fifty years
hence, of a true and honest man here in the Yellow River. Lo! That is exactly
fifty years ago. Now Yuan Shao is very hard on the people and they hate him.
You, Sir, having raised this army in the cause of humanity and righteousness,
out of pity for the people and to punish crimes, and having destroyed the
hordes of Yuan Shao at Guandu, just fulfill the prophecy of Yin Kui. The
millions of the land may look now for tranquillity.â
âHow dare I presume that I am he?â said Cao Cao with a smile.
Wine was served and refreshments brought in, and the old gentlemen were sent
away with presents of silk stuffs. And an order was issued to the army that if
anyone killed so much as a fowl or a dog belonging to the villagers, he should
be punished as for murder. And the soldiers obeyed with fear and trembling
while Cao Cao rejoiced in his heart.
It was told Cao Cao that the total army from the four regions under the Yuan
family amounted to two hundred thirty thousand soldiers and they were camped at
Cangting. Cao Cao then advanced nearer to them and made a strong camp.
Next day the two armies were arrayed over against each other. On one side Cao
Cao rode to the front surrounded by his commanders, and on the other appeared
Yuan Shao supported by his three sons, his nephew, and his leaders.
Cao Cao spoke first, âYuan Shao, your schemes are poor, your strength is
exhausted, why still refuse to think of surrender? Are you waiting till the
sword shall be upon your neck? Then it will be too late.â
Yuan Shao turned to those about him, saying, âWho dares go out?â
His son Yuan Shang was anxious to exhibit his prowess in the presence of his
father, so he flourished his pair of swords and rode forth.
Cao Cao pointed him out to his officers and asked, âAnyone knows him?â
âHe is the youngest son of Yuan Shao,â was the reply.
Before they had finished speaking, from their own side rode out Shi Huan, armed
with a spear. The two champions fought a little while and suddenly Yuan Shang
whipped up his horse, made a feint and fled. His opponent followed. Yuan Shang
took his bow, fitted an arrow, turned in his saddle, and shot at Shi Huan,
wounding him in the left eye. Shi Huan fell from the saddle and died on the
spot.
Yuan Shao seeing his son thus get the better of his opponent, gave the signal
for attack, and the whole army thundered forward. The onslaught was heavy, but
presently the gongs on both sides sounded the retire and the battle ceased.
When he had returned to camp, Cao Cao took counsel to find a plan to overcome
Yuan Shao. Then Cheng Yu proposed the plan of the âTen Ambushesâ and
persuaded Cao Cao to retire upon the river, placing troops in ambush as he
went. Thus would Yuan Shao be inveigled into pursuit as far as the river, when
Cao Caoâs army would be forced to make a desperate stand or be driven into
the water.
Cao Cao accepted this suggestion and told off ten companies of five thousand
soldiers each to lie in ten ambush on two sides of the road of retreat. The
arrangement of the ambushes were thus: On the left, first company under Xiahou
Dun; second company, Zhang Liao; third company, Li Dian; fourth company, Yue
Jing; fifth company, Xiahou Yuan; on the right, first company was under Cao
Hong; second company, Zhang He; third company, Xu Huang; fourth company, Yu
Jin; fifth company, Gao Lan. Xu Chu commanded the advanced front.
Next day the ten companies started first and placed themselves right and left
as ordered. In the night Cao Cao ordered the advanced front to feign an attack
on the camp, which roused all the enemy in all their camps. This done, Xu Chu
retreated and Yuan Shaoâs army came in pursuit. The roar of battle went on
without cessation, and at dawn Cao Caoâs army rested on the river and could
retreat no farther.
Then Cao Cao shouted, âThere is no road in front, so all must fight or
die.â
The retreating army turned about and advanced vigorously. Xu Chu simply flew to
the front, smote and killed ten generals and threw Yuan Shaoâs army into
confusion. They tried to turn and march back, but Cao Cao was close behind.
Then the drums of the enemy were heard, and right and left there appeared two
ambush companies of Gao Lan and Xiahou Yuan. Yuan Shao collected about him his
three sons and his nephew, and they were enabled to cut an alley out and flee.
Three miles further on they fell into another ambush of Yue Jing and Yu Jin,
and here many troops of Yuan Shao were lost so that their corpses lay over the
countryside and the blood filled the water courses. Another three miles and
they met the third pair of Li Dian and Xu Huang barring their road.
Here they lost heart and bolted for an old camp of their own that was near, and
bade their men prepare a meal. But just as the food was ready to eat, down came
Zhang Liao and Zhang He and burst into the camp.
Yuan Shao mounted and fled as far as Cangting, when he was tired and his steed
spent. But there was no rest, for Cao Cao came in close pursuit. It seemed now
a race for life. But presently Yuan Shao found his onward course again blocked
by Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong, and he groaned aloud.
âIf we do not make most desperate efforts, we are all captives!â said he.
And they plunged forward. His second son Yuan Xi and his nephew Gao Gan were
wounded by arrows, and most of his soldiers were dead or had disappeared. He
gathered his sons into his arms and wept bitterly. Then he fell into a swoon.
He was picked up, but his mouth was full of blood which ran forth in a bright
scarlet stream.
He sighed, saying, âMany battles have I fought, and little did I think to be
driven to this. Heaven is afflicting me. You had better return each to his own
territory and swear to fight this Cao Cao to the end.â
Then Yuan Shao bade Xin Ping and Guo Tu as quickly as possible follow Yuan Tan
to Qingzhou and prepare to give battle to Cao Cao lest he should invade. Yuan
Xi was told to go to Youzhou and Gao Gan to Bingzhou.
So each started to prepare armies and horses for repulsing Cao Cao. Yuan Shao
with his youngest son Yuan Shang and the remnant of his officers went away to
Jizhou, and military operations were suspended for a time.
Meanwhile Cao Cao was distributing rewards to his army for the late victory,
and his spies were scouting all about Jizhou. He soon learned that Yuan Shao
was ill, and that the youngest son Yuan Shang and Shen Pei were in command of
the city, while his brothers and cousin had returned each to his own. Cao
Caoâs advisers were in favor of a speedy attack.
But he objected, saying, âJizhou is large and well supplied. Shen Pei is an
able strategist. And it behooves me to be careful. I would rather wait till the
autumn when the crops have been gathered in so that the people will not
suffer.â
While the attack was being talked over there came letters from Xun Yu:
âLiu Bei was strengthening himself at Runan with the force of Liu Pi and Gong
Du and, when he heard that you was attacking Jizhou, he said he would take the
opportunity to march on the capital. Wherefore you, Sir, should hasten homeward
to defend Xuchang.â
This news disconcerted Cao Cao. He left Cao Hong in command on the river bank,
with orders to maintain the appearance of strength there, while he led the main
part of his army to meet the threatened attack from Runan.
Meanwhile Liu Bei, his brothers, and the leaders, having gone forth with the
intention of attacking the capital, had reached a point near the Rang Mountains
when Cao Cao came upon them. So Liu Bei camped by the hills and divided his
army into three, sending Guan Yu and Zhang Fei with ten thousand troops each to
entrench themselves southeast and southwest respectively of the main body,
which he and Zhao Zilong commanded.
When Cao Cao came near, Liu Bei beat his drums and went out to where Cao Cao
had already arrayed his army.
Cao Cao called Liu Bei to a parley, and when the latter appeared under his
great standard, Cao Cao pointed his whip at him and railed, saying, âI
treated you as a guest of the highest consideration. Why then do you turn your
back on righteousness and forget kindness?â
Liu Bei replied, âUnder the name of Prime Minister you are really a rebel. I
am a direct descendant of the family, and I have a secret decree from the
Throne to take such offenders as you.â
As he said these words, he produced and recited the decree which is known as
the âGirdle Mandate.â
Cao Cao grew very angry and ordered Xu Chu to go out to battle. As Liu Beiâs
champion, out rode Zhao Zilong with spear ready to thrust. The two warriors
exchanged thirty bouts without advantage to either. Then there arose an earth-
rending shout and up came the two brothers, Guan Yu from the southeast and
Zhang Fei from the southwest. The three armies then began a great attack, which
proved too much for Cao Caoâs troops, fatigued by a long march, and they were
worsted and fled. Liu Bei having scored this victory returned to camp.
Next day he sent out Zhao Zilong again to challenge the enemy, but it was not
accepted and Cao Caoâs army remained ten days without movement. Then Zhang
Fei offered a challenge which also was not accepted. And Liu Bei began to feel
anxious.
Then unexpectedly came news that the enemy had stopped a train of supplies
brought by Gong Du, and at once Zhang Fei went to the rescue. Worse still was
the news that followed, that an army led by Xiahou Dun had got in behind to
attack Runan.
Quite dismayed, Liu Bei said, âIf this be true, I have enemies in front and
rear and have no place to go.â
He then sent Guan Yu to try to recover the city and thus both his brothers were
absent from his side. One day later a horseman rode up to say that Runan had
fallen, its defender Liu Pi had fled, and Guan Yu was surrounded. To make the
matters worse, the news came that Zhang Fei, who had gone to rescue Gong Du,
was in like case.
Liu Bei tried to withdraw his troops, fearing all the time an attack from Cao
Cao. Suddenly the sentinels came in, saying: âXu Chu is at the camp gate
offering a challenge.â
Liu Bei did not allow his army to go out. They waited till dawn, and then Liu
Bei bade the soldiers get a good meal and be ready to start. When ready the
foot went out first, the horsemen next, leaving a few troops in the camp to
beat the watches and maintain an appearance of occupation.
After traveling some miles, they passed some mounds. Suddenly torches blazed
out, and on the summit stood one who shouted, âDo not let Liu Bei run away!
I, the Prime Minister, am here awaiting you!â
Liu Bei dashed along the first clear road he saw.
Zhao Zilong said, âFear not, my lord, only follow me!â
And setting his spear, Zhao Zilong galloped in front opening an alley as he
went. Liu Bei gripped his double swords and followed close. As they were
winning through, Xu Chu came in pursuit and engaged Zhao Zilong, and two other
companies led by Yu Jin and Li Dian bore down as well. Seeing the situation so
desperate, Liu Bei plunged into the wilds and fled. Gradually the sounds of
battle became fainter and died away while he went deeper and deeper into the
hills, a single horseman fleeing for his life. He kept on his way till
daybreak, when a company suddenly appeared beside the road. Liu Bei saw these
men with terror at first, but was presently relieved to find they were led by
the friendly Liu Pi. They were a company of his defeated army escorting the
family of their chief. With them also were Sun Qian, Jian Yong, and Mi Fang.
They told him, âThe attack on Runan was too strong to be resisted, and so we
were compelled to abandon the defense, and the enemy followed, and only Guan
Yuâs timely arrival saved us from destruction.â
âI do not know where my brother is,â said Liu Bei.
âAll will come right if you will push on,â said Liu Pi.
They pushed on. Before they had gone far, the beating of drums was heard and
suddenly appeared Zhang He with a thousand soldiers.
Zhang He cried, âLiu Bei, quickly dismount and surrender!â
Liu Bei was about to retire when he saw a red flag waving from a rampart on the
hills and down came rushing another body of troops under Gao Lan.
Thus checked in front and his retreat cut off, Liu Bei looked up to Heaven and
cried, âO Heaven, why am I brought to this state of misery? Nothing is left
me now but death!â
And he drew his sword to slay himself.
But Liu Pi stayed his hand, saying, âLet me try to fight a way out and save
you. Death is nothing to me!â
As he spoke Gao Lanâs force was on the point of engaging his. The two leaders
met and in the third bout Liu Pi was cut down. Liu Bei at once rushed up to
fight, but just then there was sudden confusion in the rear ranks of the
opponents, and a warrior dashed up and thrust at Gao Lan with his spear. Gao
Lan fell from his steed. The newcomer was Zhao Zilong.
His arrival was most opportune. He urged forward his steed thrusting right and
left, and the enemyâs ranks broke and scattered. Then the first force under
Zhang He came into the fight, and the leader and Zhao Zilong fought thirty or
more bouts. However, this proved enough, for Zhang He turned his horse away
recognizing that he was worsted. Zhao Zilong vigorously attacked, but was
forced into a narrow space in the hills where he was hemmed in. While seeking
for some outlet, they saw Guan Yu, Guan Ping, and Zhou Cang, with three hundred
men, coming along. Soon Zhang He was driven off, and then Liu Beiâs troops
came out of the narrow defile and occupied a strong position among the hills
where they made a camp.
Liu Bei sent Guan Yu for news of the missing brother. Zhang Fei had been
attacked by Xiahou Yuan who had killed Gong Du, but Zhang Fei had vigorously
resisted, beaten him off, and followed him up. Then Yue Jing had come along and
surrounded Zhang Fei.
In this pass he was found by Guan Yu, who had heard of his plight from some of
his scattered soldiers met on the way. Now they drove off the enemy. The two
brothers returned. Soon they heard of the approach of a large body of Cao
Caoâs army. Liu Bei then bade Sun Qian guard his family and sent him on
ahead, while he and the others kept off the enemy, sometimes giving battle and
anon marching. Seeing that Liu Bei had retired too far, Cao Cao let him go and
left the pursuit.
When Liu Bei collected his army, he found they numbered only a thousand, and
this halting and broken force marched as fast as possible to the west. Coming
to a river they asked the natives its name and were told it was the Han River,
and near it Liu Bei made a temporary camp. When the local people found out who
was in the camp, they presented meat and wine.
A feast was given upon a sandy bank of the Han River.
After they had drunk awhile, Liu Bei addressed his faithful followers, saying,
âAll you, Fair Sirs, have talents fitting you to be advisers to a monarch,
but your destiny has led you to follow poor me. My fate is distressful and full
of misery. Today I have not a spot to call my own, and I am indeed leading you
astray. Therefore I say you should abandon me and go to some illustrious lord
where you may be able to become famous.â
At these words they all covered their faces and wept.
Guan Yu said, âBrother, you are wrong to speak thus. When the great Founder
of Han contended with Xiang Yu, he was defeated many times, but he won at the
Nine-Mile Mountains and that achievement was the foundation of a dynasty that
endured for four centuries. Victory and defeat are but ordinary events in a
soldierâs career, and why should you give up?â
âSuccess and failure both have their seasons,â said Sun Qian, âand we are
not to grieve. Jingzhou, which your illustrious relative, Liu Biao, commands,
is a rich and prosperous country. Liu Biao is of your house, why not go to
him?â
âOnly that I fear he may not receive me,â said Liu Bei.
âThen let me go and prepare the way. I will make Liu Biao come out to his
borders to welcome you.â
So with his lordâs approval, Sun Qian set off immediately and hastened to
Jingzhou. When the ceremonies of greeting were over, Liu Biao asked the reason
of the visit.
Said Sun Qian, âThe princely Liu Bei is one of the heroes of the day,
although just at the moment he may lack soldiers and leaders. His mind is set
upon restoring the dynasty to its pristine glory, and at Runan the two
commanders, Liu Pi and Gong Du, though bound to him by no ties, were content to
die for the sake of his ideals. You, Illustrious Sir, like Liu Bei, are a scion
of the imperial stock. Now the Princely One has recently suffered defeat and
thinks of seeking a home in the east with Sun Quan. I have ventured to dissuade
him, saying that he should not turn from a relative and go to a mere
acquaintance; telling him that you, Sir, are well known as courteous to the
wise and condescending to scholars, so that they flock to you as the waters
flow to the east sea, and that certainly you would show kindness to one of the
same ancestry. Wherefore he has sent me to explain matters and request your
commands.â
âHe is my brother,â said Liu Biao, âand I have long desired to see him,
but no opportunity has occurred. I should be very happy if he would come.â
Cai Mao, who was sitting by, here broke in, âNo, no! Liu Bei first followed
Lu Bu, then he served Cao Cao, and next he joined himself to Yuan Shao. And he
stayed with none of these, so that you can see what manner of man he is. If he
comes here, Cao Cao will assuredly come against us and fight. Better cut off
this messengerâs head and send it as an offering to Cao Cao, who would reward
you well for the service.â
Sun Qian sat unmoved while this harangue was pronounced, saying at the end,
âI am not afraid of death. Liu Bei, the Princely One, is true and loyal to
the state and so out of sympathy with Lu Bu, or Cao Cao, or Yuan Shao. It is
true he followed these three, but there was no help for it. Now he knows your
chief is a member of the family, so that both are of the same ancestry, and
that is why he has come far to join him. How can you slander a good man like
that?â
Liu Biao bade Cai Mao be silent and said, âI have decided, and you need say
no more.â
Whereat Cai Mao sulkily left the audience chamber.
Then Sun Qian was told to return with the news that Liu Bei would be welcome,
and Imperial Protector Liu Biao went ten miles beyond the city to meet his
guest.
When Liu Bei arrived, he behaved to his host with the utmost politeness and was
warmly welcomed in return. Then Liu Bei introduced his two sworn brothers and
friends and they entered Jingzhou City where Liu Bei finally was lodged in the
Imperial Protectorâs own residence.
As soon as Cao Cao knew whither his enemy had gone, he wished to attack Liu
Biao, but Cheng Yu advised against any attempt so long as Yuan Shao, the
dangerous enemy, was left with power to inflict damage.
He said, âMy lord should return to the capital to refresh the soldiers so
that they may be ready for a north and south campaign in the mild spring
weather.â
Cao Cao accepted his advice and set out for the capital. In the first month of
the eighth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 203), Cao Cao once again began to
think of war, and sent to garrison Runan as a precaution against Liu Biao.
Then, after arranging for the safety of the capital, he marched a large army to
Guandu, the camp of the year before, and aimed at Jizhou.
As to Yuan Shao, who had been suffering from blood-spitting but was now in
better health, he began to think of measures against Xuchang, but Shen Pei
dissuaded him, saying, âYou are not yet recovered from the fatigues of last
year. It would be better to make your position impregnable and set to improving
the army.â
When the news of Cao Caoâs approach arrived, Yuan Shao said, âIf we allow
the foe to get close to the city before we march to the river, we shall have
missed our opportunity. I must go out to repel this army.â
Here his son Yuan Shang interposed, âFather, you are not sufficiently
recovered for a campaign and should not go so far. Let me lead the army against
this enemy.â
Yuan Shao consented, and he sent to Qingzhou and Youzhou and Bingzhou to call
upon his other two sons and his nephew to attack Cao Cao at the same time as
his own army.
Against Runan they beat the drum,
And from Jizhou the armies come.
To whom the victory will be seen in the next chapter.

**** Chapter 32 ****
without deigning to wait the arrival of his brothers, he marched out with
thirty thousand troops to Liyang to meet the army of Cao Cao. Zhang Liao came
out to challenge him, and Yuan Shang, accepting the challenge rode out with
spear set. But he only lasted to the third bout when he had to give way. Zhang
Liao smote with full force and Yuan Shang, quite broken, fled pell-mell to
Jizhou. His defeat was a heavy shock to his father Yuan Shao, who had a severe
fit of hemorrhage at the news and swooned.
Lady Liu, his wife, got him to bed as quickly as possible, but he did not
rally; and she soon saw it was necessary to prepare for the end. So she sent
for Shen Pei and Peng Ji that the succession might be settled. They came and
stood by the sick manâs bed, but by this time he could no longer speak. He
only made motions with his hands.
When his wife put the formal question, âIs Yuan Shang to succeed?â
Yuan Shao nodded his head. Shen Pei at the bedside wrote out the dying manâs
testament. Presently Yuan Shao uttered a loud moan, a fresh fit of bleeding
followed, and he passed away.
Born of a line of nobles famous for generations,
He himself in his youth was wayward always and headstrong,
Vainly he called to his side generals skilled and courageous,
Gathered beneath his banner countless legions of soldiers,
For he was timid at heart, a lamb dressed as a tiger,
Merely a cowardly chicken, phoenix-feathered but spurless.
Pitiful was the fate of his house; for when he departed
Brother with brother strove and quarrels arose in the household.
Shen Pei and some others set about the mourning ceremonies for the dead man.
His wife, Lady Liu, put to death five of his favorite concubines, and such was
the bitterness of her jealousy that, not content with this, she shaved off the
hair and slashed the faces of their poor corpses lest their spirits should meet
and rejoin her late husband in the land of shades beneath the Nine Golden
Springs. Her son followed up this piece of cruelty by slaying all the relatives
of the unhappy concubines lest they should avenge their deaths.
Shen Pei and Peng Ji declared Yuan Shang successor with the titles of Regent
Marshal and Supreme Imperial Protector of the four regions of Jizhou, Qingzhou,
Youzhou, and Bingzhou and sent in a report of the death of the late Imperial
Protector.
At this time Yuan Tan, the eldest son, had already marched out his army to
oppose Cao Cao. But hearing of his fatherâs death, he called in Guo Tu and
Xin Ping to consult as to his course of action.
âIn your absence, my lord,â said Guo Tu, âthe two advisers of your
younger brother will certainly set him up as lord, wherefore you must act
quickly.â
âThose two, Shen Pei and Peng Ji, have already laid their plans,â said Xin
Ping. âIf you go, you will meet with some misfortune.â
âThen what should I do?â asked Yuan Tan.
Guo Tu replied, âGo and camp near the city, and watch what is taking place
while I enter and inquire.â
Accordingly Guo Tu entered the city and sought an interview with the young
Imperial Protector.
âWhy did not my brother come?â asked Yuan Shang after the usual salutes.
Guo Tu said, âHe cannot come as he is in the camp unwell.â
âBy the command of my late father, I take the lordship. Now I confer upon my
brother the rank of General of the Flying Cavalry, and I wish him to go at once
to attack Cao Cao, who is pressing on the borders. I will follow as soon as my
army is in order.â
âThere is no one in our camp to give advice,â said Guo Tu. âI wish to
have the services of Shen Pei and Peng Ji.â
âI also need the help of these two,â said Yuan Shang. âAnd as I am always
working at schemes, I do not see how I can do without them.â
âThen let one of these two go,â replied Guo Tu.
Yuan Shang could do no other than accede to this request, so he bade the two
men cast lots who should go. Peng Ji drew the lot and was appointed, receiving
a seal of office. Then he accompanied Guo Tu to the camp. But when he arrived
and found Yuan Tan in perfect health, he grew suspicious and resigned.
Yuan Tan angrily refused to accept his resignation and was disposed to put him
to death, but Guo Tu privately dissuaded him, saying, âCao Cao is on the
borders, and Peng Ji must be kept here to allay your brotherâs suspicions.
After we have beaten Cao Cao, we can at once make an attempt on Jizhou.â
Yuan Tan agreed and forthwith broke up his camp to march against the enemy. He
reached Liyang and lost no time in offering battle. He chose for his champion
Wang Zhao and, when Wang Zhao rode out, Cao Cao sent Xu Huang to meet him.
These two had fought but a few bouts when Wang Zhao was slain. At once Cao
Caoâs army pressed forward, and Yuan Tan suffered a severe defeat. Yuan Tan
drew off his army and retired into Liyang, whence he sent to his brother for
reinforcements.
Yuan Shang and his adviser Shen Pei discussed the matter and only five thousand
troops were sent. Cao Cao hearing of the dispatch of this meager force sent Li
Dian and Yue Jing to waylay them, and the half legion was destroyed. When Yuan
Tan heard of the inadequate force sent and their destruction, he was very wrath
and roundly abused Peng Ji.
Peng Ji replied, âLet me write to my lord and pray him to come himself.â
So Peng Ji wrote and the letter was sent. When it arrived, Yuan Shang again
consulted Shen Pei.
The Counselor said, âGuo Tu, your elder brotherâs adviser, is very
guileful. Formerly he left without discussion because Cao Cao was on the
border. If Cao Cao be defeated, there will certainly be an attempt on you. The
better plan is to withhold assistance and use Cao Caoâs hand to destroy your
rival.â
Yuan Shang took his advice and no help was sent. When the messenger returned to
Liyang without success, Yuan Tan was very angry and showed it by putting Peng
Ji to death. He also began to talk of surrendering to Cao Cao. Soon spies
brought news of this to Yuan Shang, and again Shen Pei was called in.
Yuan Shang said, âIf Yuan Tan goes over to Cao Cao, they will both attack
Jizhou, and we shall be in great danger.â
Finally Shen Pei and General Su You were left to take care of the defense of
the city, and Yuan Shang marched his army to the rescue of his brother.
âWho dares lead the van?â said Yuan Shang.
Two brothers named Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang volunteered, and thirty thousand
troops were given them. They were the first to reach Liyang.
Yuan Tan was pleased that Yuan Shang had decided to play a brotherly part and
come to his aid, so he at once abandoned all thought of going over to the
enemy. He being in the city, Yuan Shang camped outside, making that an ox-horn
formation of their strategic position.
Before long Yuan Xi, the second brother, and their cousin, Gao Gan, arrived
with their legions and also camped outside the city.
Engagements took place daily, and Yuan Shang suffered many defeats. On the
other hand Cao Cao was victorious and elated. In the second month of the eighth
year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 203), Cao Cao made separate attacks on all
four armies and won the day against each. Then the Yuans abandoned Liyang, and
Cao Cao pursued them to Jizhou, where Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang went into the
city to defend it, while their brother and cousin camped about ten miles away
making a show of great force.
When Cao Cao had made many attacks without success, Guo Jia proffered the
following plan.
He said, âThere is dissension among the Yuans because the elder has been
superseded in the succession. The brothers are about equally strong and each
has his party. If we oppose them, they unite to assist each other; but if we
have patience, they will be weakened by family strife. Wherefore send first a
force to reduce Liu Biao in Jingzhou, and let the fraternal quarrels develop.
When they have fully developed, we can smite them and settle the matter.â
Cao Cao approved of the plan. So leaving Jia Xu as Governor of Liyang and Cao
Hong as guard at Guandu, the army went away toward Jingzhou.
The two brothers Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang congratulated each other on the
withdrawal of their enemy, and their brother Yuan Xi and their cousin Gao Gan
marched their armies back to their own districts.
Then the quarrels began. Yuan Tan said to his confidants Guo Tu and Xin Ping,
âI, the eldest, have been prevented from succeeding my father, while the
youngest son, born of a second wife, received the main heritage. My heart is
bitter.â
Said Guo Tu, âCamp your army outside, invite your brother and Shen Pei to a
banquet, and assassinate them. The whole matter is easily settled.â
And Yuan Tan agreed. It happened that Adviser Wang Xiu came just then from
Qingzhou whom Yuan Tan took into his confidence.
Wang Xiu opposed the murder plan, saying, âBrothers are as oneâs limbs. How
can you possibly succeed if at a moment of conflict with an enemy you cut off
one of your hands? If you abandon your brother and sever relationship, whom
will you take in all the world as a relation? That fellow Guo Tu is a dangerous
mischief-maker, who would sow dissension between brothers for a momentary
advantage, and I beg you to shut your ears and not listen to his
persuasions.â
This was displeasing to Yuan Tan, and he angrily dismissed Wang Xiu, while he
sent the treacherous invitation to his brother.
Yuan Shang and Shen Pei talked over the matter.
Shen Pei said, âI recognize one of Guo Tuâs stratagems and if you go, my
lord, you will be the victim of their plot. Rather strike at them at once.â
Whereupon Yuan Shang rode out to battle. His brother Yuan Tan, seeing him come
with fifty thousand troops, knew that his treachery had been discovered, so he
also took the field. When the forces were near enough, Yuan Tan opened on Yuan
Shang with a volley of abuse.
âYou poisoned my father and usurped the succession. Now you come out to slay
your elder brother?â
The battle went against Yuan Tan. Yuan Shang himself took part in the fight,
risking the arrows and the stones. He urged on his troops and drove his brother
off the field. Yuan Tan took refuge in Pingyuan. Yuan Shang drew off his army
to his own city.
Yuan Tan and Guo Tu decided upon a new attack, and this time they chose General
Cen Bi as Leader of the Van. Yuan Shang went to meet him. When both sides had
been arrayed and the banners were flying and the drums beating, Cen Bi rode out
to challenge and railed at his opponent. At first Yuan Shang was going to
answer the challenge himself, but Lu Kuang had advanced. Lu Kuang and Cen Bi
met but had fought only a few bouts when Cen Bi fell. Yuan Tanâs soldiers
were once more defeated and ran away to Pingyuan. Shen Pei urged his master to
press for the advantage, and Yuan Tan was driven into the city, where he
fortified himself and would not go out. So the city was besieged on three
sides.
Yuan Tan asked his strategist what should be done next, and Guo Tu said, âThe
city is short of food, the enemy is flushed with victory, and we cannot stand
against them. My idea is to send someone to offer surrender to Cao Cao and thus
get him to attack Jizhou. Your brother will be forced to return thither, which
will leave you free to join in the attack. We may capture Yuan Shang. Should
Cao Cao begin to get the better of your brotherâs army, we will lend our
force to help Yuan Shang against Cao Cao; and as Cao Caoâs base of supply is
distant, we shall drive him off. And we can seize on Jizhou and begin our great
design.â
âSupposing this scheme be attempted, who is the man for a messenger?â
âI have one Xin Pi, Xin Pingâs younger brother. Xin Pi is the magistrate
here in this very place. He is a fluent speaker and good scholar and suited to
your purpose.â
So Xin Pi was summoned and came readily enough. Letters were given him and an
escort of three thousand soldiers took him beyond the border. He traveled as
quickly as possible.
At that time Cao Caoâs camp was at the Xiping Pass and he was attacking Liu
Biao, who had sent Liu Bei out to offer the first resistance. No battle had yet
taken place.
Soon after his arrival, Xin Pi was admitted to the Prime Ministerâs presence.
After the ceremonies of greeting, Cao Cao asked the object of the visit. Xin Pi
explained that Yuan Tan wanted assistance and presented his dispatches. Cao Cao
read them and told the messenger to wait in his camp while he called his
officers to a council.
The council met. Cheng Yu said, âYuan Tan has been forced into making this
offer because of the pressure of his brotherâs attack. Put no trust in
him.â
Lu Qian and Man Chong said, âYou have led your armies here for a special
purpose. How can you abandon that and go to assist Yuan Tan?â
âGentlemen, not one of you is giving good advice,â interposed Xun You.
âThis is how I regard it. Since there is universal trouble, in the midst of
which Liu Biao remains quietly content with his position between the River
Zhang and the River Han, it is evident that he has no ambition to enlarge his
borders. The Yuans hold four regions and have many legions of soldiers. Harmony
between the two brothers means success for the family, and none can foresee
what will happen in the empire. Now take advantage of this fraternal conflict
and let them fight till they are weakened and have to yield to our Prime
Minister. Then Yuan Shang can be removed, and when the times are suitable, Yuan
Tan can be destroyed in his turn. Thus peace will ensue. This present
combination of circumstances is to be taken advantage of to full measure.â
Cao Cao realized the truth of this and treated Xin Pi well.
At a banquet Cao Cao said, âBut is this surrender of Yuan Tan real or false?
Do you really think that Yuan Shangâs army is sure to overcome him?â
Xin Pi replied, âIllustrious Sir, do not inquire into the degree of
sincerity; rather regard the situation. The Yuans have been suffering military
losses for years and are powerless without, while their strategists are put to
death within. The brothers seize every chance to speak evil of each other, and
their country is divided. Add to this famine, supplemented by calamities and
general exhaustion, and everybody, wise as well as simple, can see that the
catastrophe is near and the time ordained of Heaven for the destruction of the
Yuans is at hand. Now you have a force attacking the capital of Jizhou â-
Yejun â-and if Yuan Shang will not return to give aid, the place of refuge is
lost. If he helps, then Yuan Tan will follow up and smite him, making use of
your power to destroy the remnant of his brotherâs army, just as the autumn
gale sweeps away the fallen leaves. Now Liu Biaoâs Jingzhou is rich, the
government peaceful, the people submissive, and it cannot be shaken. Moreover,
there is no greater threat to it than the North of Yellow River. If that be
reduced, then the task is complete. I pray you, Sir, think of it.â
âI am sorry that I did not meet you earlier,â said Cao Cao, much gratified
with this speech.
Forthwith orders were given to return and attack Jizhou. Liu Bei, fearing this
retirement was only a ruse, allowed it to proceed without interference and
himself returned to Jingzhou.
When Yuan Shang heard that Cao Cao had crossed the Yellow River, he hastily led
his army back to Yejun, ordering Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang to guard the rear.
Yuan Tan started from Pingyuan with a force in pursuit. He had proceeded only a
dozen miles when he heard a bomb and two bodies of troops came out in front of
him and checked his progress. Their leaders were Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang.
Yuan Tan reined in and addressed them, saying, âWhile my father lived, I
never treated you badly. Why do you support my brother and try to injure me?â
The two generals had no reply to make, but they dismounted and bowed before him
yielding submission.
Yuan Tan said, âDo not surrender to me but to the Prime Minister.â
And he led them back to camp, where he waited the arrival of Cao Cao and then
presented the pair. Cao Cao received them well. He promised his daughter to
Yuan Tan to wife, and he appointed the two brothers as advisers.
When Yuan Tan asked Cao Cao to attack Jizhou, the reply was: âSupplies are
short and difficult to transport. I must turn the waters of River Ji into the
White River whereby to convey my grain and afterwards I can advance.â
Ordering Yuan Tan to remain in Pingyuan, Cao Cao retired into camp at Liyang.
The two brothers Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang, who were renegades from Yuan Shang,
were now raised to noble rank and followed the army as supernumeraries.
Guo Tu noted this advancement and said to Yuan Tan, âHe has promised you a
daughter to wife. I fear that bodes no good. Now he has given titles of
nobility to the two Lus and taken them with him. This is a bait for the
northern people, and at the same time he intends evil toward us. You, my lord,
should have two generalsâ seals engraved and send them secretly to the
brothers so that you may have friends at court ready for the day when Cao Cao
shall have broken your brotherâs power, and we can begin to work against
him.â
The seals were engraved and sent.
As soon as the Lu brothers received them, they informed Cao Cao, who smiled,
saying, âHe wants your support so he sends you seals as officers. I will
consider it as soon as Yuan Shang has been dealt with. In the meantime you may
accept the seals till I shall decide what to do.â
Thenceforward Cao Cao planned Yuan Tanâs doom.
Shen Pei and his master also discussed the current situation. Yuan Shang said,
âCao Cao is getting grain into the White River, which means an attack on
Jizhou. What is to be done?â
Shen Pei replied, âSend letters to Yin Kai, Commander of Wuan, bidding him
camp at Maocheng to secure the road to Shangdang, and direct Ju Gu, son of Ju
Shou, to maintain Handan as a distant auxiliary. Then you may advance on
Pingyuan and attack Yuan Tan. After he is destroyed, Cao Cao is next.â
The plan seemed good. Yuan Shang left Shen Pei and Chen Lin in charge of Yejun,
appointed two Commanders Ma Yan and Zhang Zi as Van Leaders, and set out
hastily for Pingyuan.
When Yuan Tan heard of the approach of his brotherâs army, he sent urgent
messages to Cao Cao, who said to himself, âI am going to get Jizhou this
time.â
Just at this time it happened that Xun You came down from the capital. When he
heard that Yuan Shang was attacking his brother Yuan Tan, he sought Cao Cao and
said, âYou, Sir, sit here on guard. Are you waiting till Heavenâs thunder
shall strike the two Yuans?â
âI have thought it all out,â said Cao Cao.
Then he ordered Cao Hong to go and fight against Yejun, while he led another
army against Yin Kai in Maocheng. Yin Kai could make no adequate defense and
was killed by Xu Chu. His soldiers ran away and presently joined Cao Caoâs
army. Next Cao Cao led the army to Handan, and Ju Gu came out to fight him.
Zhang Liao advanced to fight with Ju Gu, and after the third encounter Ju Gu
was defeated and fled. Zhang Liao went after him, and when their two horses
were not far apart, Zhang Liao took his bow and shot. The fleeing warrior fell
as the bowstring twanged. Cao Cao completed the rout, and Ju Guâs force was
broken up.
Now Cao Cao led his armies to an attack on Yejun. Cao Hong had arrived before,
and a regular siege began. The army encompassed the city and began by throwing
up great mounds. They also tunneled subterranean ways.
Within the city Shen Pei turned his whole care to the defense and issued the
severest commands. The Commander of the East Gate, Feng Li, got intoxicated and
failed to keep his watch for which he was severely punished. Feng Li resented
this, sneaked out of the city, went over to the besiegers, and told them how
the place could be attacked.
âThe earth within the Pearly Gate is solid enough to be tunneled, and
entrance can be effected there,â said the traitor.
So Feng Li was sent with three hundred men to carry out his plan under cover of
darkness.
After Feng Li had deserted to the enemy, Shen Pei went every night to the wall
to inspect the soldiers on duty. The night of the sapping he went there as
usual and saw that there were no lights outside the city and all was perfectly
quiet.
So he said to himself, âFeng Li is certain to try to come into the city by an
underground road.â
Whereupon he ordered his troops to bring up stones and pile them on the cover
of the tunnel opening. The opening was stopped up and the attacking party
perished in the tunnel they had excavated.
Cao Cao having failed in this attempt abandoned the scheme of underground
attack. He drew off the army to a place above the River Huan to await till Yuan
Shang should return to relieve the city.
Yuan Shang heard of the defeat of Yin Kai and Ju Gu, and the siege of his own
city, and bethought himself of relieving it.
One of his commanders, Ma Yan, said, âThe high road will surely be ambushed.
We must find some other way. We can take a by-road from the West Hills and get
through by River Fu, whence we can fall upon Cao Caoâs camp.â
The plan was acceptable and Yuan Shang started off with the main body, Ma Yan
and Zhang Zi being rear guard.
Cao Caoâs spies soon found out this move, and when they reported it, he said,
âIf Yuan Shang comes by the high road, I shall have to keep out of the way;
but if by the West Hillsâ by-road, I can settle him in one battle. And I
think he will show a blaze as a signal to the besieged that they may make a
sortie. I shall prepare to attack both.â
So Cao Cao made his preparations. Now Yuan Shang went out by River Fu east
toward Yangping, and near this he camped. Thence to Yejun was five miles. River
Fu ran beside the camp. He ordered his soldiers to collect firewood and grass
ready for the blaze he intended to make at night as his signal. He also sent Li
Mu, a civil officer, disguised as an officer of Cao Caoâs army, to inform
Shen Pei of his intentions.
Li Mu reached the city wall safely and called out to the guards to open. Shen
Pei recognized his voice and let him in. Thus Shen Pei knew of the arrangements
for his relief, and it was agreed that a blaze should be raised within the city
so that the sortie could be simultaneous with Yuan Shangâs attack. Orders
were given to collect inflammables.
Then said Li Mu, âAs your food supply is short, it would be well for the old
people, the feeble soldiers and the women to surrender. This will come upon
them as a surprise, and we will send the soldiers out behind them.â
Shen Pei promised to do all this, and next day they hoisted on the wall a white
flag with the words The populace of Jizhou surrender! on it.
âHo ho! This means no food,â said Cao Cao. âThey are sending away the
non-combatants to escape feeding them. And the soldiers will follow behind
them.â
Cao Cao bade Zhang Liao and Xu Huang laid an ambush of three thousand troops on
both sides while he went near the wall in full state. Presently the gates were
opened and out came the people supporting their aged folks and leading their
little ones by the hand. Each carried a white flag. As soon as the people had
passed the gate, the soldiers followed with a rush.
Then Cao Cao showed a red flag, and the ambushing soldiers led by Zhang Liao
and Xu Huang fell upon the sortie. The troops tried to return and Cao Caoâs
force made a direct attack. The chase continued to the drawbridge, but there
Cao Caoâs force met with a tremendous shower of arrows and crossbow bolts
which checked the advance. Cao Caoâs helmet was struck and the crest carried
away. His leaders came to pull him back, and the army retired.
As soon as Cao Cao had changed his dress and mounted a fresh horse, he set out
at the head of the army to attack Yuan Shangâs camp.
Yuan Shang led the defense. The attack came simultaneously from many
directions. The defenders were quite disorganized and presently defeated. Yuan
Shang led his troops back by the West Hills and made a camp under their
shelter. Thence he sent messengers to urge Ma Yan and Zhang Zi to bring up the
supports. He did not know that Cao Cao had sent Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang to
persuade these two into surrender and that they had already passed under Cao
Caoâs banner, and he had conferred upon them the title of lordship.
Just before going to attack the West Hills, Cao Cao sent Lu Xiang, Lu Kuang, Ma
Yan, and Zhang Zi to seize the source of Yuan Shangâs supplies.
Yuan Shang had realized he could not hold the hills, so he went by night to
Lankou. Before he could get camped, he saw flaring lights springing up all
around him and soon an attack began. He was taken aback and had to oppose the
enemy with his men half armed, his steeds unsaddled. His army suffered, and he
had to retreat another fifteen miles. By that time his force was too enfeebled
to show any resistance, and as no other course was possible, he sent the
Imperial Protector of Yuzhou, Yin Ku, to Cao Caoâs camp and ask that he might
surrender.
Cao Cao feigned to consent, but that night he sent Zhang Liao and Xu Huang to
raid Yuan Shangâs camp. Then it became flight, abandoning everything, seals,
emblems of office, and even personal clothing. Yuan Shang made for the
Zhongshan Mountains.
Then Cao Cao came to attack Jizhou City, and to help out this Xun You suggested
drowning the city by turning the course of the River Zhang. Cao Cao adopted the
suggestion and at once sent a small number of men to dig a channel to lead the
water to the city. All told, it was seventeen miles.
Shen Pei saw the diggers from the city wall and noticed that they made only a
shallow channel.
He chuckled, saying to himself, âWhat is the use of such a channel to drown
out the city from a deep river?â
So he made no preparations to keep out the water.
But as soon as night came on, Cao Cao increased his army of diggers tenfold and
by daylight the channel was deepened to twenty spans and the water was flowing
in a great stream into the city where it already stood some spans deep. So this
misfortune was added to the lack of food.
Xin Pi now displayed the captured seal and garments of Yuan Shang hung out on
spears, to the great shame of their late owner, and called upon the people of
the city to surrender. This angered Shen Pei, who avenged the insult by putting
to death on the city wall the whole of the Xin family who were within the city.
There were eighty of them, and their severed heads were cast down from the
walls. Xin Pi wept exceedingly.
Shen Peiâs nephew Shen Rong, one of the gate wardens, was a dear friend of
Xin Pi, and the murder of Xin Piâs family greatly distressed him. He wrote a
secret letter offering to betray the city and tied it to an arrow, which he
shot out among the besiegers. The soldiers found it, gave it to Xin Pi who took
it to his chief.
Cao Cao issued an order:
âThe family of the Yuans should be spared when the city should be taken and
that no one who surrendered should be put to death.â
The next day the soldiers entered by the west gate, opened for them by Shen
Rong. Xin Pi was the first to prance in on horseback and the army followed.
When Shen Pei, who was on the southeast of the city, saw the enemy within the
gates, he placed himself at the head of some horsemen and dashed toward them.
He was met and captured by Xu Huang who bound him and led him outside the city.
On the road they met Xin Pi, who ground his teeth with rage at the murderer of
his relatives and then struck the prisoner over the head with his whip, crying,
âMurder! Blood drinker! You will meet your death!â
Shen Pei retorted, âTraitor! Seller of the city! I am very sorry I was not to
have slain you before.â
When the captive was taken into Cao Caoâs presence, Cao Cao said, âDo you
know who opened the gate to let me in?â
âNo, I know not.â
âIt was your nephew Shen Rong who gave up the gate,â said Cao Cao.
âHe was always unprincipled, and it has come to this!â said Shen Pei.
âThe other day when I approached the city, why did you shoot so hard at
me?â
âI am sorry we shot too little.â
âAs a faithful adherent of the Yuans, you could do no otherwise. Now will you
come over to me?â
âNever; I will never surrender.â
Xin Pi threw himself on the ground with lamentations, saying, âEighty of my
people murdered by this ruffian. I pray you slay him, O Prime Minister!â
âAlive, I have served the Yuans;â said Shen Pei, âdead, I will be their
ghost! I am no flattering time-server as you are. Kill me!â
Cao Cao gave the order. They led him away to put him to death.
On the execution ground he said to the executioners, âMy lord is in the
north, I pray you not to make me face the south.â
So Shen Pei knelt facing the north and extended his neck for the fatal stroke.
Who of all the official throng
In the North was true like Shen Pei?
Sad his fate! He served a fool,
But faithful, as the ancient humans.
Straight and true was every word,
Never from the road he swerved.
Faithful unto death, he died
Gazing toward the lord heâd served.
Thus died Shen Pei and from respect for his character Cao Cao ordered that he
be buried honorably on the north of the city.
The Prime Minister then entered the city of Yejun. As he was starting, he saw
the executioners hurrying forward a prisoner who proved to be Chen Lin.
âYou wrote that manifesto for Yuan Shao. If you had only directed your
diatribe against me, it would not have mattered. But why did you shame my
forefathers?â said Cao Cao.
âWhen the arrow is on the string, it must fly,â replied Chen Lin.
Those about Cao Cao urged him to put Chen Lin to death, but he was spared on
account of his genius and given a civil post.
Now Cao Caoâs eldest son was named Cao Pi. At the taking of the cities he was
eighteen years of age. When he was born a dark purplish halo hung over the
house for a whole day. One who understood the meaning of such manifestations
had secretly told Cao Cao that the halo belonged to the imperial class and
portended honors which could not be put into words.
At eight the lad could compose very skillfully, and he was well read in ancient
history. Now he was an adept at all military arts and very fond of fencing. He
had gone with his father on the expedition to Jizhou. When Yejun had fallen, he
led his escort in the direction of the Yuan family dwelling, and when he
reached it, he strode in, sword in hand. When some commander would have stayed
him, saying that by order of the Prime Minister no one was to enter the house,
Cao Pi bade them begone. The guards fell back and he made his way into the
private rooms, where he saw two women weeping in each otherâs arms. He went
forward to slay them.
Four generations of honors, gone like a dream,
Fate follows on ever surely, though slow she seems.
The fate of the two women will be told in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 33 ****
As was said, Cao Pi, having made his way into the Yuansâ palace, saw two
women there whom he was about to kill. Suddenly a red light shone in his eyes,
and he paused.
Lowering his sword he said, âWho are you?â
âThy handmaid is the widow of the late Yuan Shao, Lady Liu,â said the elder
of the two, âand this is the wife of Yuan Xi, his second son. She was of the
Zhen family. When Yuan Xi was sent to command in Youzhou, her family objected
to her going so far from home and she stayed behind.â
Cao Pi drew Lady Zhen toward him and looked at her closely. Her hair hung
disordered, her face was dusty and tear-stained, but when, with the sleeve of
his inner garment, he had wiped sway these disfigurements, he saw a woman of
exquisite loveliness, with a complexion clear as jade touched with the tender
bloom of a flower petal, a woman indeed beautiful enough to ruin a kingdom.
âI am the son of the Prime Minister,â said he turning to the elder woman.
âI will guarantee your safety, so you need fear nothing.â
He then put by his sword and sat down at the upper end of the room.
As Cao Cao was entering the gate of the conquered city of Yejun, Xu You rode up
very quickly, passed him, and pointed with his whip at the gate, saying, âSir
Prime Minister, you would not have been here but for my plans!â
Cao Cao laughed, but his generals were very annoyed.
When Cao Cao reached the residence, he stopped at the gate and asked, âHas
anyone had gone in?â
The guard at the gate said, âYour son is within.â
Cao Cao called him out and chided him, but the wife of the late Imperial
Protector interposed, saying, âBut not for your son we had not been saved. I
desire to present to you a lady, of the Zhen family, as a handmaid to your
son.â
Cao Cao bade them bring out the girl and she bowed before him. After looking at
her intently, he said, âJust the wife for him!â
And he told Cao Pi to take Lady Zhen to wife.
After the conquest of Jizhou had been made quite sure, Cao Cao made a
ceremonial visit to the Yuan family cemetery, where he sacrificed at the tomb
of his late rival, bowed his head, and lamented bitterly.
Turning to his generals, he said, âNot long ago when Yuan Shao and I worked
together in military matters, he asked me, saying, âIf this disturbance does
not cease, what fronts should be held?â And I replied asking him what he
thought. He said, âIn the North of Yellow River, to the south I would hold
the Yellow River; on the north, guard against Yan and Dai and absorb the hordes
from the Gobi Desert. Thence southward I would try for the empire, and do you
not think I might succeed?â I replied saying, âI depend upon the wisdom and
force of the world directed by scholars; then every thing would be possible.â
These words seem as if spoken only yesterday, and now he is gone. Thinking over
it I cannot refrain from tears.â
His officers were deeply affected. Cao Cao treated the widow generously, giving
her gold and silks and food to her content.
He also issued a further order that the taxes in the North of Yellow River
would be remitted in consideration of the sufferings of the people during the
warlike operations. He sent up a memorial to the Throne and formally became
Imperial Protector of Jizhou.
One day Xu Chu, riding in at the east gate, met Xu You, who called out to him,
âWould you fellows be riding through here if it had not been for me?â
Xu Chu replied, âWe fellows, those who survive and those who perished, risked
our lives in bloody battle to get this city, so do not brag of your deeds!â
âYou are a lot of blockheads, not worth talking about,â said Xu You.
Xu Chu in his anger drew his sword and ran Xu You through. Then he took Xu
Youâs head and went to tell Cao Cao the reason.
Said Cao Cao, âHe and I were old friends, and we could joke together. Why did
you kill him?â
Cao Cao blamed Xu Chu very severely and gave orders that Xu You should be
buried honorably.
Cao Cao inquired for any wise and reputable people who were known to be living
in the region and was told: âCommander Cui Yan, of Dongwu, who had on many
occasions given valuable advice to Yuan Shao. As the advice was not followed,
he had pleaded indisposition and remained at home.â
Cao Cao sent for this man, gave him an office and said to him, âAccording to
the former registers, there are three hundred thousand households in the region
so that one may well call it a major region.â
Cui Yan replied, âThe empire is rent, and the country is torn; the Yuan
brothers are at war, and the people have been stripped naked. Yet, Sir, you do
not hasten to inquire after local conditions and how to rescue the people from
misery, but first compute the possibilities of taxation. Can you expect to gain
the support of our people by such means?â
Cao Cao accepted the rebuke, changed the policy, thanked him, and treated him
all the better for it.
As soon as Jizhou was settled, Cao Cao sent to find out the movements of Yuan
Tan. He heard Yuan Tan was ravaging Ganling, Anping, Bohai, and Hejian.
Moreover, the scouts brought the news that Yuan Shang had fled to Zhongshan,
and Yuan Tan led an expedition against him, but Yuan Shang would not face a
battle. He had gone away to Youzhou to his brother Yuan Xi. Yuan Tan, having
gathered Yuan Shangâs troops, prepared for another attempt on Jizhou.
Whereupon Cao Cao summoned him. Yuan Tan refused to come, and Cao Cao sent
letters breaking off the marriage between Yuan Tan and his daughter. Soon after
Cao Cao led an expedition against Yuan Tan and marched to Pingyuan, whereupon
Yuan Tan sent to Liu Biao to beg assistance. Liu Biao sent for Liu Bei to
consult about this.
Liu Bei said, âCao Cao is very strong now that he has overcome Jizhou, and
the Yuans will be unable to hold out for long. Nothing is to be gained by
helping Yuan Tan, and it may give Cao Cao the loophole he is always looking for
to attack this place. My advice is to keep the army in condition and devote all
our energies to defense.â
âAgreed; but what shall we say?â said Liu Biao.
âWrite to both the brothers as peacemaker in gracious terms.â
Accordingly Liu Biao wrote thus to Yuan Tan:
âWhen the superior person would escape danger, that person does not go to an
enemy state. I heard recently that you had crooked the knee to Cao Cao, which
was ignoring the enmity between him and your father, rejecting the duties of
brotherhood, and leaving behind you the shame of an alliance with the enemy. If
your brother, the successor to Jizhou, has acted unfraternally, your duty was
to bend your inclination to follow him and wait till the state of affairs had
settled. Would it not have been very noble to bring about the redress of
wrongs?â
And to Yuan Shang, Liu Biao wrote:
âYour brother, the ruler of Qingzhou, is of an impulsive temperament and
confuses right with wrong. You ought first to have destroyed Cao Cao in order
to put an end to the hatred which your father bore him and, when the situation
had become settled, to have endeavored to redress the wrongs. Would not that
have been well? If you persist in following this mistaken course, remember the
hound and the hare, both so wearied that the peasant got them all.â
From this letter Yuan Tan saw that Liu Biao had no intention of helping him,
and feeling he alone could not withstand Cao Cao. He abandoned Pingyuan and
fled to Nanpi, whither Cao Cao pursued him.
The weather was very cold and the river was frozen, so that the grain boats
could not move. Wherefore Cao Cao ordered the inhabitants to break the ice and
tow the boats. When the peasants heard the order they ran away. Cao Cao angrily
wished to arrest and behead them. When they heard this, they went to his camp
in a body and offered their heads to the sword.
âIf I do not kill you, my order will not be obeyed,â said Cao Cao. âYet
supposing I cut off your heads, but I cannot bear to do that severity. Quickly
flee to the hills and hide so that my soldiers do not capture you.â
The peasants left weeping.
Then Yuan Tan led out his army against Cao Cao. When both sides were arrayed,
Cao Cao rode to the front.
Pointing with his whip at his opponent, Cao Cao railed at him, saying, âI
treated you well. Why then have you turned against me?â
Yuan Tan replied, âYou have invaded my land, captured my cities, and broken
off my marriage. Yet you accuse me of turning against you!â
Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang to go out and give battle. Yuan Tan bade Peng An
accept the challenge. After a few bouts Peng An was slain; and Yuan Tan, having
lost, fled and went into Nanpi, where he was besieged. Yuan Tan, panic-
stricken, sent Xin Ping to see Cao Cao and arrange surrender.
âHe is nothing but a fickle-minded child,â said Cao Cao. âHe is never of
the same mind two days running, and I cannot depend upon what he says. Now your
brother Xin Pi is in my employ and has a post of importance, you had better
remain here also.â
âSir Prime Minister, you are in error,â said Xin Ping. âIt is said that
the lordâs honor is the servantâs glory; the lordâs sadness is the
servantâs shame. How can I turn my back on the family I have so long
served?â
Cao Cao felt he could not be persuaded and sent him back. Xin Ping returned and
told Yuan Tan the surrender could not be arranged.
Yuan Tan turned on him angrily, saying, âYour brother is with Cao Cao, and
you want to betray me also!â
At this unmerited reproach such a huge wave of anger welled up in Xin Pingâs
breast that he was overcome and fell in a swoon. They carried him out, but the
shock had been too severe, and soon after he died. Yuan Tan regretted his
conduct when it was too late.
Then Guo Tu said, âTomorrow when we go out to battle, we will drive the
people out in front as a screen for the soldiers, and we must fight a winning
battle.â
That night they assembled all the common people of the place and forced into
their hands swords and spears. At daylight they opened the four gates, and a
huge party with much shouting came out at each, peasantry carrying arms in
front, and soldiers behind them. They pushed on toward Cao Caoâs camps, and a
melee began lasted till near midday. But this was quite indecisive, although
heaps of dead lay everywhere.
Seeing that success was at best only partial, Cao Cao rode out to the hills
near and thence had the drums beaten for a new attack under his own eye. His
officers and troops, seeing that he could observe them in person, exerted
themselves to the utmost, and Yuan Tanâs army was severely defeated. Of the
peasantry driven into the battlefield, multitudes were slain.
Cao Hong, who displayed very great valor, burst into the press of battle and
met Yuan Tan face to face. The two slashed and hammered at each other, and Yuan
Tan was killed.
Guo Tu saw that his side was wholly disorganized and tried to withdraw into the
shelter of Nanpi. Yue Jing saw this and opened a tremendous discharge of arrows
so that Guo Tu fell and the moat was soon filled with dead.
The city of Nanpi fell to Cao Cao. He entered and set about restoring peace and
order. Then suddenly appeared a new army under two of Yuan Xiâs generals,
Jiao Chu and Zhang Neng. Cao Cao led out his troops to meet them, but the two
commanders laid down their arms and yielded. They were rewarded with the rank
of lordship.
Then Zhang Yan, the leader of the Black Hills Brigands, came with one hundred
thousand troops and gave in his submission. He was made General Who Pacifies
the North.
By an order of Cao Cao, the head of Yuan Tan was exposed, and death was
threatened to anyone who should lament for him. Nevertheless a man dressed in
mourning attire was arrested for weeping below the exposed head at the north
gate. Taken into Cao Caoâs presence, he said he was Wang Xiu and had been an
officer in Qingzhou. He had been expelled because he had remonstrated with Yuan
Tan. But when the news of Yuan Tanâs death came, he had come to weep for his
late master.
âDid you know of my command?â said Cao Cao.
âI knew it.â
âYet you were not afraid?â
âWhen one has received favors from a man in life, it would be wrong not to
mourn at his death. How can one stand in the world if one forgets duty through
fear? If I could bury his body, I would not mind death.â
Cao Cao said, âAnd there were many such as this in the north. What a pity
that the Yuan family could not make the best of them! But if they had done so,
I should never have dared to turn my eyes toward this place.â
The intrepid mourner was not put to death. The remains of Yuan Tan were
properly interred, and Wang Xiu was well treated and even given an appointment.
In his new position Wang Xiu was asked for advice about the best way to proceed
against Yuan Shang, who had fled to his second brother, but Wang Xiu remained
silent, thereby winning from Cao Cao renewed admiration for his constancy.
âHe is indeed loyal!â said Cao Cao.
Then he questioned Guo Jia, who advised him, saying, âGive Yuan Xiâs former
generals the command and ask them to attack Youzhou.â
Whereupon Jiao Chu and Zhang Neng were given the command and reinforced by the
armies under Lu Xiang, Lu Kuang, Ma Yan, and Zhang Zi to bring about the
surrender of Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang. Then six generals, to attack Youzhou along
three routes. Other armies led by Li Dian, Yue Jing, and Zhang Yan were sent
against Gao Gan at Bingzhou.
The two Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang heard of Cao Caoâs advance with dismay for
they had no hope of successful resistance. Therefore they abandoned Youzhou and
hastily marched into Liaoxi to seek refuge with the Wuhuan tribespeople in the
frontier Wuhuan State.
Then Wuhuan Chu, new Imperial Protector of Youzhou, was not disposed to incur
the enmity of the powerful Cao Cao, so he called his subordinates together to
swear them to support him.
Wuhuan Chu said, âI understand that Cao Cao is the most powerful man of the
day, and I am going to support him, and those who do not go with me I shall put
to death.â
Each in turn smeared his lips with the blood of sacrifice and took the oath,
till it came to the turn of Han Heng.
Instead he dashed his sword to the ground, crying, âI have received great
promotions and benefits from the Yuans. Now my lord has been vanquished. My
knowledge was powerless to save him, and my bravery insufficient to cause me to
die for him: I have failed in my duty. But I refuse to commit the crowning act
of treachery and ally myself with Cao Cao.â
This speech made the others turn pale.
The chief said, âFor a great undertaking, there must be lofty principles.
However, success does not necessarily depend upon universal support, and since
Han Heng is actuated by such sentiments, then let him follow his conscience.â
So Wuhuan Chu turned Han Heng out of the assembly. Wuhuan Chu then went out of
the city to meet and welcome Cao Caoâs army and rendered his submission. He
was well received and the title given him of General Who Guards the North.
Then the scouts came to report: âGenerals Li Dian, Yue Jing, and Zhang Yan
had marched to Bingzhou, but that Gao Gan had occupied Huguan Pass and could
not be dislodged.â
So Cao Cao marched thither himself. The defender still maintaining his
position, Cao Cao asked for plans. Xun You proposed that a band should go over
pretending to be deserters. Cao Cao assented and then called the two Lu Xiang
and Lu Kuang, to whom he gave whispered orders. They left with their companies.
Soon they came near the pass and called out, saying, âWe are old officers in
Yuan Shaoâs armies forced into surrender to Cao Cao. We find him so false and
he treats us so meanly that we want to return to help our old master. Wherefore
quickly open your gates to us.â
Gao Gan was suspicious, but he let the two officers come up to the pass; and
when they had stripped off their armor and left their horses, they were
permitted to enter.
And they said to Gao Gan, âCao Caoâs troops are new to the country and not
settled. You ought to fall upon their camp this very evening. If you approve,
we will lead the attack.â
Gao Gan decided to trust them and prepared to attack, giving the two brothers
the leadership of ten thousand soldiers. But as they drew near Cao Caoâs
camp, a great noise arose behind them and they found themselves in an ambush
attacked on all sides. Realizing too late that he had been the victim of a
ruse, Gao Gan retreated to the pass, but found it occupied by Li Dian and Yue
Jing. Gao Gan then made the best of his way to the Chieftain of the Xiongnu
People. Cao Cao gave orders to hold the passes and sent companies in pursuit.
When Gao Gan reached the boundary of the Xiongnu State, he met Ce Xian, the
Khan of the northern tribespeople.
Gao Gan dismounted and made a low obeisance, saying, âCao Cao is conquering
and absorbing all the borders and your turn, O King, will come quickly. I pray
you help me and let us smite together for the safety of the northern
regions.â
Ce Xian the Khan replied, âI have no quarrel with Cao Cao. Why then should he
invade my land? Do you desire to embroil me with him?â
He would have nothing to do with Gao Gan and sent him sway. At his witsâ end,
Gao Gan decided to try to join Liu Biao and go southward so far on his journey
as Shanglu when he was taken prisoner and put to death by Governor Wang Yan.
His head was sent to Cao Cao, and Wang Yan received lordship for this service.
Thus Bingzhou was conquered. Then Cao Cao began to discuss the overthrow of the
Wuhuan State.
Cao Hong, speaking in the name of other officials, said, âThe two Yuan Xi and
Yuan Shang are nearly done for and too weak to be feared. They have fled far
into the Sea of Sand. If we pursue them thither, it may bring down Liu Biao and
Liu Bei upon the capital. Should we be unable to rescue it, the misfortune
would be immense. Wherefore we beg you to return to Xuchang.â
But Guo Jia was of different advice.
âYou are wrong,â said he. âThough the prestige of our lord fills the
empire, yet the peoples of the desert, relying upon their inaccessibility, will
not be prepared against us. Wherefore I say attack, and we shall conquer them.
Beside Yuan Shao was kind to the nomads, and the two brothers have been more
so. They must be destroyed. As for Liu Biao he is a mere gossip, who needs not
cause the least anxiety. And Liu Bei is unfit for any heavy responsibility and
will take no trouble over a light one. You may leave the base with perfect
safety and make as long an expedition as you choose. Nothing will happen.â
âYou speak well, O Guo Jia,â said Cao Cao.
He led his legions, heavy and light, to the edge of the desert, with many
wagons. The expedition marched into the Gobi Desert. The rolling ocean of
yellow sand spread its waves before them, and they saw far and near the eddying
sand pillars, and felt the fierce winds that drove them forward. The road
became precipitous and progress difficult. Cao Cao began to think of returning
and spoke thereof to Guo Jia, who had advised the journey.
Guo Jia had speedily fallen victim to the effects of the climate, and at this
time he lay in his cart very ill.
Cao Caoâs tears fell as he said, âMy friend, you are suffering for my
ambition to subdue the Gobi Desert. I cannot bear to think you should be
ill.â
âYou have always been very good to me,â said the sick man, âand I can
never repay what I owe you.â
âThe country is exceedingly precipitous, and I am thinking of going back.
What think you?â
Guo Jia replied, âThe success of an expedition of this kind depends upon
celerity. To strike a sudden blow on a distant spot with a heavy baggage train
is difficult. To ensure success the need is light troops and a good road to
strike quickly before an enemy has time to prepare. Now you must find guides
who know the road well.â
Then the sick adviser was left at Yezhou for treatment, and they sought among
the natives for some persons to serve as guides. Tian Chou, one of Yuan
Shaoâs old generals, knew those parts well, and Cao Cao called him and
questioned him.
Tian Chou said, âBetween autumn and summer this route is under water, the
shallow places too heavy for wheeled traffic, the deep parts insufficient for
boats. It is always difficult. Therefore you would do better to return and at
Lulong cross the Baitan Pass into the desert. Then advance to Liucheng and
smite before there is time to prepare. One sudden rush will settle King Mao
Dun.â
For this valuable information and plan, Tian Chou was made General Who Calms
the North, and went in advance as leader and guide. Next after him came Zhang
Liao, and Cao Cao brought up the rear. They advanced by double marches.
Tian Chou led Zhang Liao to White Wolf Hills, where they came upon Yuan Xi,
Yuan Shang, and King Mao Dun and a force of ten thousand cavalry. Zhang Liao
galloped to inform his chief, and Cao Cao rode up to the top of an eminence to
survey the foe. He saw a large mass of cavalry without any military formation
advancing in a disorderly crowd.
Said he, âThey have no formation. We can easily rout them.â
Then he handed over his ensign of command to Zhang Liao who, with Xu Chu, Yu
Jin, and Xu Huang, made a vigorous attack from four different points, with the
result that the enemy was thrown into confusion. Zhang Liao rode forward and
slew King Mao Dun, and the other generals gave in. Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang with
a few thousand of horse got away east into Liaodong.
Cao Cao then led his army into Liucheng. For his services, Tian Chou was
conferred the rank of Lord of Liucheng and Commander of that county.
But Tian Chou declined the rank, saying with tears, âI am a renegade and a
fugitive. It is my good fortune that you spared my life, and how can I accept a
rank for betraying Lulong? I would rather die than accept the lordship.â
Cao Cao recognized that reason was on Tian Chouâs side and conferred upon him
the office of Court Counselor. Cao Cao then pacified the Xiongnu Chieftains,
collected a large number of horses, and at once set out on the homeward march.
The season was winter, cold and dry. For seventy miles there was no water, and
grain also was scanty. The troops fed on horse flesh. They had to dig very
deep, three or four hundred spans to find water.
When Cao Cao reached Yezhou, he rewarded those who had remonstrated with him
against the expedition.
He said, âI took some risk in going so far, but by good fortune I have
succeeded. With the aid of Heaven I have secured victory. I could not be guided
by your advice, but still they were counsels of safety, and therefore I reward
you to prove my appreciation of advice and that hereafter you may not fear to
speak your minds.â
Adviser Guo Jia did not live to see the return of his lord. His coffin was
placed on the bier in a hall of the government offices, and Cao Cao went
thither to sacrifice to his manes.
Cao Cao mourned for him, crying, âAlas! Heaven has smitten me: Guo Jia is
dead!â
Then turning to his officers he said, âYou, gentlemen, are of the same age as
myself, but he was very young to die. I needed him for the future generation,
and unhappily he has been torn from me in the flower of his age. My heart and
my bowels are torn with grief.â
The servants of the late adviser presented his last testament, which they said
his dying hand had written, and he had told them to say, âIf the Prime
Minister shall follow the advice given herein, then Liaodong will be secure.â
Cao Cao opened the cover and read, nodding his head in agreement and uttering
deep sighs. But no other person knew what was written therein.
Shortly after, Xiahou Dun at the head of a delegation presented a petition,
saying, âFor a long time the Governor of Liaodong, Gongsun Kang, has been
contumacious, and it bodes ill for peace that the Yuan brothers have fled to
him. Would it not be well to attack before they move against you?â
âI need not trouble your tiger courage, Sirs,â said Cao Cao smiling.
âWait a few days and you will see the heads of our two enemies sent to me.â
They could not believe it.
As has been related the two Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang escaped to the east with a
few hundreds of horse. The Governor of Liaodong was a son of Gongsun Du the
Warlike, the General of Han. Gongsun Kang was a native of Xiangping. When he
heard that Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang were on their way to his territory, he called
a council to decide upon his plan.
At the council Gongsun Gong rose, saying, âWhen Yuan Shao was alive, he
nourished the plan of adding this territory to his own. Now his sons, homeless,
with a broken army and no officers, are coming here. It seems to me like the
dove stealing the magpieâs nest. If we offer them shelter, they will
assuredly intrigue against us. I advise that they be inveigled into the city,
put to death, and their heads sent to Cao Cao, who will be most grateful to
us.â
Said the Governor Gongsun Kang, âI have one fear: Cao Cao will come against
us. If so, it would be better to have the help of the Yuans against him.â
âThen you can send spies to ascertain whether Cao Caoâs army is preparing
to attack us. If it is, then save the Yuans alive; if not, then follow my
advice.â
It was decided to wait till the spies came back.
In the meantime, Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang had taken counsel together as they
approached Liaodong, saying, âLiaodong has a large army, strong enough to
oppose Cao Cao. We will go thither and submit till we can slay the Governor and
take possession. Then when we are strong enough, we will attack and recover our
own land.â
With these intentions they went into the city. They were received and lodged in
the guestsâ quarters. But when they wished to see Gongsun Kang, he put them
off with the excuse of indisposition.
However, before many days the spies returned with the news that Cao Caoâs
army was quiescent and there was no hint of any attack.
Then Gongsun Kang called Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang into his presence. But before
they came he hid swordsmen and ax-men behind the arras in the hall. When the
visitors came and had made their salutations, Gongsun Kang bade them be seated.
Now it was bitterly cold and on the couches where they were sitting were no
coverings. So Yuan Shang said, âMay we have cushions?â
The host said, âWhen your heads take that long, long journey, will there be
any cushions?â
Before Yuan Shang could recover from his fright, Gongsun Kang shouted, âWhy
do you not begin?â
At this out rushed the assassins and the heads of the two brothers were cut off
as they sat. Packed in a small wooden box they were sent to Cao Cao at Yezhou.
All this time Cao Cao had been calmly waiting. His impatient officers had
petitioned in a body, saying, âLetâs march to the capital to ward off Liu
Biaoâs threat if we are not going to attack the east.â
Cao Cao said, âI am waiting for the heads of the enemy. We will go as soon as
the heads arrive.â
In their secret hearts they laughed. But then, surely enough, messenger soon
came from Liaodong bringing the heads. Then they were greatly surprised.
And when the messenger presented Gongsun Kangâs letters, Cao Cao cried,
âJust as Guo Jia said!â
He amply rewarded the messenger, and the Governor of Liaodong was made Lord of
Xiangping and General of the Left Army. When the officers asked what had
happened, Cao Cao told them what the late adviser had predicted. He read to
them the dead officerâs testament, which ran something like this:
âYuan Xi and Yuan Shang are going to Liaodong. Illustrious Sir, you are on no
account to attack, for Gongsun Kang has long lived in fear lest the Yuans
should absorb his country. When they arrive, Gongsun Kang will hesitate. If you
attack, he will save the Yuans to help him; if you wait, they will work against
each other. This is evident.â
The officers simply jumped with surprise to see how perfectly events had been
foreseen. Then Cao Cao at the head of all his officers performed a grand
sacrifice before the coffin of the wise Guo Jia. He had died at the age of
thirty-eight, after eleven years of meritorious and wonderful service in wars.
When Heaven permitted Guo Jiaâs birth,
It made him ablest man on earth.
He knew by rote all histories,
From him war kept no mysteries.
Like Fan Liâs, his plans were quite decisive,
As Chen Pingâs, his strokes were most incisive.
Too soon he ran his earthly race,
Too soon the great beam fell from place.
When Cao Cao returned to Jizhou, he sent off the coffin of his late adviser to
Capital Xuchang where it was interred.
Then Cheng Yu and others said, âAs the north has been overcome, it is time to
settle the south.â
Cao Cao was pleased and said, âThat has long occupied my thoughts.â
The last night he spent in Jizhou, Cao Cao went to the eastern corner tower and
stood there regarding the sky. His only companion was Xun You.
Presently Cao Cao said, âThat is a very brilliant glow there in the south. It
seems too strong for me to do anything there.â
âWhat is there that can oppose your heaven-high prestige?â said Xun You.
Suddenly a beam of golden light shot up out of the earth.
âSurely a treasure is buried there,â remarked Xun You.
They went down from the city wall, called some guards, and led them to the
point whence the light proceeded. There the men were ordered to dig.
The southern skies with portents glow,
The northern lands their treasures show.
What the diggers found will appear in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 34 ****
The diggers at the spot whence the golden light proceeded presently unearthed a
bronze bird. Looking at it, Cao Cao turned to his companion, saying, âWhat is
the portent?â
âYou will remember that the mother of the praiseworthy King Shun dreamed of a
jade bird before his birth, so certainly it is a felicitous omen,â said Xun
You.
Cao Cao was very pleased, and he ordered forthwith the building of a lofty
tower to celebrate the find, and they began to dig foundations and cut timber,
to burn tiles and to smooth bricks for the Bronze Bird Tower on the banks of
the River Zhang. Cao Cao set a year for the building.
His younger son, Cao Zhi, said, âIf you build a terraced tower, you should
add two others, one on each side. The center tower as the tallest should be
called the Bronze Bird Tower. The side towers named Jade Dragon Tower and
Golden Phoenix Tower. Then connect these by flying bridges and the effect will
be noble.â
âMy son, your words are very good; and by and bye when the building is
complete, I can solace my old age therein.â
Cao Cao had five sons, but this one Cao Zhi was the most clever and his essays
were particularly elegant. His father was very fond of him and, seeing that the
young man took an interest in the building, Cao Cao left him with his elder
brother Cao Pi at Yejun to superintend the work, while he led a half-a-million
army that had recently been captured from the Yuans back to Capital Xuchang.
When he arrived, he distributed rewards liberally and memorialized the Throne
obtaining the title of the Pure Lord for the late Guo Jia. And he took Guo
Jiaâs son, Guo Ye, to be brought up in his own family.
Next Cao Cao began to consider the reduction of Liu Biaoâs power.
Xun You said, âThe Grand Army has only just returned from the north and needs
rest. Wait half a year that the soldiers may recover from the fatigue of the
campaign, and both Liu Biao and Sun Quan will fall at the first roll of the
drums.â
Presently Cao Cao approved of this plan. To enrich his troops, he assigned
certain lands to them to till while they rested.
In Jingzhou, Liu Biao had been very generous to Liu Bei ever since he had come
as a fugitive seeking shelter. One day at a banquet there came news that two
generals, Zhang Wu and Chen Sun, who had tendered their submission, had
suddenly begun plundering the people in Jiangxia. They evidently meant
rebellion.
âIf they really rebel, it will cause a lot of trouble,â said Liu Biao,
rather dismayed.
âDo not let that trouble you. I will go and settle it,â said Liu Bei.
Pleased with this proposal, Liu Biao told off thirty thousand troops and placed
them under his friend, and the army marched as soon as the orders were issued.
In a short time it reached the scene, and the two malcontents came out to
fight. Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhao Zilong took their stand beneath
the great banner and looked over at the enemy.
Zhang Wu was riding a handsome prancing horse, and Liu Bei said, âHe
certainly has a fine steed.â
As he spoke, Zhao Zilong galloped out with his spear set and dashed toward the
enemy. Zhang Wu came out to meet him, but the combat was very brief for Zhang
Wu was soon killed by a spear thrust. Thereupon Zhao Zilong laid a hand upon
the bridle of the fallen manâs horse to lead it back to his own side. The
slain rebelâs companion Chen Sun at once rode after Zhao Zilong, whereupon
Zhang Fei uttered a loud shout and rode out to meet him. With one thrust Zhang
Fei slew the rebel. Their followers now scattered, and Liu Bei speedily
restored order in Jiangxia and returned to Jingzhou City.
Liu Biao, grateful for this service, rode out to the boundary to welcome the
victors. They reentered the city and grand banquets were instituted, at which
they emptied great goblets in congratulations over the victory.
At one of these banquets the Imperial Protector said, âWith such heroism as
my brother has shown, Jingzhou has one upon whom to rely. But a source of
sorrow is the borders with the lands of Yue, Wu, and Shu, from which a raid may
come at any time. Zhang Lu of Shu and Sun Quan of Yue and Wu are to be
feared.â
âBut I have three bold generals,â said Liu Bei, âquite equal to any task
you can set them. Send Zhang Fei to keep ward on the southern border of Yue,
Guan Yu to guard the city of Guzi against Zhang Lu in the west, and Zhao Zilong
holding the Three Gorges will protect you from Sun Quan. Why need you
grieve?â
The scheme appealed strongly to the Imperial Protector, but Cai Mao did not
approve.
So he spoke to his sister, Liu Biaoâs wife, saying, âLiu Bei is putting his
troops in such commanding positions all round the region. That is the
danger.â
Lady Cai, thus influenced by her brother, undertook to remonstrate, and that
night began by saying to Liu Biao, âSome in the Jingzhou army seem to have a
great liking for Liu Bei. They are always coming and going. You ought to take
precautions. I do not think you should let Liu Bei stay in the city. Why not
send him on some mission?â
âLiu Bei is a good man,â replied the Imperial Protector.
âI think others differ from you,â said the lady.
Liu Biao said nothing but muttered to himself. Soon after he went out of the
city to see Liu Bei and noticed he was riding a very handsome horse. They told
him it was a prize taken from the recently conquered rebels; and as he praised
it very warmly, Liu Bei presented it to him. Liu Biao was delighted and rode it
back to the city. Kuai Yue saw it and asked where it had come from. The
Imperial Protector told him it was a gift from Liu Bei.
Kuai Yue said, âMy passed-away brother, Kuai Liang, knew horses very well,
and I am not a bad judge. This horse has tear-tracks running down from its eyes
and a white blaze on its forehead. It is called a Dilu horse, and it is a
danger to his master. That is why Zhang Wu was killed. I advise you not to ride
it.â
Liu Biao began to think.
Soon after he asked Liu Bei to a banquet and in the course of it said, âYou
kindly presented me with a horse lately, and I am most grateful. But you may
need it on some of your expeditions and, if you do not mind, I would like to
return it.â
Liu Bei rose and thanked him.
The Imperial Protector continued, âYou have been here a long time, and I fear
I am spoiling your career as a warrior. Now Xinye in Xiangyang is no poverty-
stricken town. How would you like to garrison it with your own troops?â
Liu Bei naturally took the offer as a command and set out as soon as he could,
taking leave of the Imperial Protector the next day. And so he took up his
quarters in Xinye.
When he left Jingzhou City, he noticed in the gate a person making him emphatic
salutations, and the man presently said, âYou should not ride that horse.â
Liu Bei looked at the man and recognized in the speaker one of the secretaries
of Liu Biao named Yi Ji, a native of Shanyang. So Liu Bei hastily dismounted
and asked why.
Yi Ji replied, âYesterday I heard that Kuai Yue told the Imperial Protector
that that horse was a Dilu horse and brought disaster to its owner. That is why
it was returned to you. How can you mount it again?â
âI am deeply touched by your affection,â replied Liu Bei, âbut a
personâs life is governed by fate, and what a horse can interfere with
that?â
Yi Ji admitted his superior view, and thereafter he kept in touch with Liu Bei
wherever he went.
The arrival of Liu Bei in Xinye was a matter of rejoicing to all the
inhabitants, and the whole administration was reformed.
In the spring of the twelfth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 207), Liu Beiâs
wife, Lady Gan, gave birth to a son who was named Liu Shan. The night of his
birth a crane settled on the roof of the house, screeched some forty times and
then flew away westward.
Just at the time of birth a miraculous incense filled the chamber. Lady Gan one
night had dreamed that she was looking up at the sky, and the constellation of
the Great Bear had fallen down her throat. And she conceived soon after.
While Cao Cao was absent from the capital on his northern expedition, Liu Bei
went to Liu Biao and said to him, âWhy do you not take this opportunity to
march against the capital? An empire might follow from that.â
âI am well placed here,â was the reply. âWhy should I attempt other
things?â
Liu Bei said no more. Then the Imperial Protector invited him into the private
apartments to drink. While they were so engaged, Liu Biao suddenly began to
sigh despondently.
âO brother, why do you sigh thus?â asked Liu Bei.
âI have a secret sorrow that is difficult to speak about,â said Liu Biao.
Liu Bei was on the point of asking what it was when Lady Cai came and stood
behind the screen, whereat Liu Biao hung his head and became silent. Before
long host and guest bade each other farewell, and Liu Bei went back to his own
place at Xinye.
That winter they heard that Cao Cao had returned from Liucheng, and Liu Bei
sighed when he reflected that his friend had paid no heed to his advice.
Unexpectedly a messenger came from the capital city with a request that Liu Bei
would go thither to consult with the Imperial Protector. So he started at once
with the messenger to Jingzhou City. He was received very kindly, and when the
salutations were over, the two men went into the private quarters at the rear
to dine.
Presently Liu Biao said, âCao Cao has returned, and he is stronger than ever.
I am afraid he means to absorb this region. I am sorry I did not follow your
advice for I have missed an opportunity.â
âIn this period of disruption, with strife on every side, one cannot pretend
that there will be no more opportunities. If you only take what that offers,
there will be nothing to regret.â
âWhat you say, brother, is quite to the point,â replied Liu Biao.
They drank on for a time till presently Liu Bei noticed that his host was
weeping, and when he asked the cause of these tears, Liu Biao replied, âIt is
that secret sorrow I spoke of to you before. I wished to tell you, but there
was no opportunity that day.â
âO brother, what difficulty have you, and can I assist you? I am entirely at
your service.â
âMy first wife, of the Chen family, bore me a son Liu Qi, my eldest. He grew
up virtuous but weakly and unfitted to succeed me in my office. Later I took a
wife of the Cai family, who bore me a son named Liu Zong, fairly intelligent.
If I pass over the elder in favor of the younger, there is the breach of the
rule of primogeniture. But if I follow law and custom, there are the intrigues
of the Cai family and clan to be reckoned with. Further, the army is in the
hollow of their hands. There will be trouble, and I cannot decide what to
do.â
Liu Bei said, âAll experience proves that to set aside the elder for the
younger is to take the way of confusion. If you fear the power of the Cai
faction, then gradually reduce its power and influence, but do not let doting
affection lead you into making the younger your heir.â
Liu Biao pondered silent. But Lady Cai had had a suspicion why her lord had
summoned Liu Bei and what was the subject of discussion, so she had determined
to listen secretly. She was behind the screen when the matter was talked over,
and she conceived deep resentment against Liu Bei for what he had said.
On his side, Liu Bei felt that his advice had fallen upon a forbidden subject,
and he arose and walked across the room. As he did so he noticed that he was
getting heavy and stiff, and a furtive tear stole down his cheek as he thought
of the past. When he returned and sat down, his host noticed the traces of
weeping and asked the cause of his sorrow.
âIn the past I was always in the saddle, and I was slender and lithe. Now it
is so long since I rode that I am getting stout, and the days and months are
slipping by â-wasted. I shall have old age on me in no time, and I have
accomplished nothing. So I am sad.â
âI have heard a story that when you were at Xuchang at the season of green
plums, you and Cao Cao were discussing heroes. You mentioned this name and that
to him as humans of parts, and he rejected everyone of them. Finally he said
that you and he were the only two persons of real worth in the whole empire. If
he with all his power and authority did not dare to place himself in front of
you, I do not think you need grieve about having accomplished nothing.â
At this flattering speech Liu Bei, as wine was getting the better of him and in
a half maudlin manner, replied, âIf I only had a starting point, then I would
not be afraid of anyone in a world full of fools.â
His host said no more and the guest, feeling that he had slipped up in speech,
rose as if drunk, took leave, and staggered out saying he must return to his
lodging to recover.
The episode has been celebrated in a poem:
When with crooking fingers counting,
Cao Cao reckoned up the forceful
Humans of real determination,
Only two he found; and one was
Liu Bei. But by inaction
He had grown both fat and slothful;
Yet the months and years in passing
Fretted him with nought accomplished.
Though Liu Biao kept silence when he heard the words of Liu Bei, yet he felt
the more uneasy. After the departure of his guest, he retired into the inner
quarters where he met his wife.
Lady Cai said, âI happened to be behind the screen just now and so heard the
words of Liu Bei. They betray scant regard for other people and mean that he
would take your territory if he could. If you do not remove him, it will go ill
with you.â
Her husband made no reply, but only shook his head.
Then Lady Cai took counsel with her kinsman Cai Mao, who said, âLet me go to
the guest-house and slay him forthwith, and we can report what we have done.â
His sister consented and he went out, and that night told off a party of
soldiers to do the foul deed.
Now Liu Bei sat in his lodging by the light of a single candle till about the
third watch, when he prepared to retire to bed. He was startled by a knock at
his door and in came Yi Ji, who had heard of the plot against his new master
and had come in the darkness to warn him. He related the details of the plot
and urged speedy departure.
âI have not said farewell to my host. How can I go away?â said Liu Bei.
âIf you go to bid him farewell, you will fall a victim to the Cai faction,â
said Yi Ji.
So Liu Bei said a hasty good-bye to his friend, called up his escort, and they
all mounted and rode away by the light of the stars toward Xinye. Soon after
they had left the soldiers arrived at the guest-house, but their intended
victim was already well on his way.
Naturally the failure of the plot chagrined the treacherous Cai Mao, but he
took the occasion to scribble some calumnious verses on one of the partitions.
Then he went to see Liu Biao to whom he said, âLiu Bei has treacherous
intentions, as can be seen from some lines written on the wall. And his hurried
departure is suspicious.â
Liu Biao felt doubtful, but he went to the guest-house and there on the wall he
read this poem:
Too long, far too long I have dreamed life away,
Gazing at scenery day after day.
A dragon can never be kept in a pond,
He should ride on the thunder to heaven and beyond.
Greatly angered by what he read, Liu Biao drew his sword and swore to slay the
writer. But before he had gone many paces, his anger had already died down, and
he said to himself, âI have seen much of the man, but have never known him
write verses. This is the handiwork of someone who wishes to sow discord
between us.â
So saying, he turned back and with the point of his sword scraped away the
poem. Then, putting up his sword, he mounted and rode home.
By and bye Cai Mao reminded him, saying, âThe soldiers are awaiting your
orders to go to Xinye and arrest Liu Bei.â
âThere is no hurry,â he replied.
Cai Mao saw his brother-in-lawâs hesitation and again sought his sister.
She said, âSoon there is to be the great gathering at Xiangyang, and we can
arrange something for that day.â
Next day Cai Mao petitioned the Imperial Protector, saying, âWe have had
several fruitful harvests recently. I pray you, Sir, attend the Full Harvest
Festival at Xiangyang. It would be an encouragement to the people.â
âI have been feeling my old trouble lately. I certainly cannot go,â replied
he, âbut my two sons can go to represent me and to receive the guests.â
âThey are full young,â replied Cai Mao. âThey may make some mistakes.â
âThen go to Xinye and request Liu Bei to receive the guests,â said Liu
Biao.
Nothing could have pleased Cai Mao more, for this would bring Liu Bei within
reach of his plot. Without loss of time he sent to Liu Bei requesting him to go
to preside at the Festival.
It has been said that Liu Bei made the best of his way home to Xinye. He felt
that he had offended by that slip in speech, but determined to keep silence
about it and attempt no explanation. So he discussed it with nobody. Then came
the message asking him to preside at the Festival, and he needed counsel.
Sun Qian said, âYou have seemed worried and preoccupied lately, and I think
something untoward happened at Jingzhou. You should consider well before you
accept this invitation.â
Thereupon Liu Bei told his confidants the whole story.
Guan Yu said, âYou yourself think your speech offended the Imperial
Protector, but he said nothing to show displeasure. You need pay no attention
to the babble of outsiders like Yi Ji. Xiangyang is quite near and, if you do
not go, Liu Biao will begin to suspect something really is wrong.â
âYou speak well,â said Liu Bei.
Said Zhang Fei, âBanquets are no good; gatherings are no better. It is best
not to go.â
âLet me take three hundred horse and foot as escort: There will be no trouble
then,â said Zhao Zilong.
âThat is the best course,â said Liu Bei.
They soon set out for the gathering place, and Cai Mao met them at the boundary
and was most affable and courteous. Soon arrived the Imperial Protectorâs
sons at the head of a great company of officers, civil and military. Their
appearance put Liu Bei more at ease. He was conducted to the guest-house, and
Zhao Zilong posted his men so as to guard it completely, while he himself,
armed, remained close to his chief.
Liu Qi said to Liu Bei, âMy father is feeling unwell and could not come,
wherefore he begs you, Uncle Liu Bei, to preside at the various ceremonies and
give encouragement to the officers who administer the region.â
âReally I am unfit for such responsibilities,â said Liu Bei. âBut my
brotherâs command must be obeyed.â
Next day it was reported that the officials from forty-two counties of nine
territories of Jingzhou had all arrived.
Then Cai Mao said to Kuai Yue, âThis Liu Bei is the villain of the age and if
left alive will certainly work harm to us. He must be got rid of now.â
âI fear you would forfeit everybodyâs favor if you harmed him,â replied
Kuai Yue.
âI have already secretly spoken in these terms to the Imperial Protector,â
said Cai Mao, âand I have his word here.â
âSo it may be regarded as settled. Then we can prepare.â
Cai Mao added, âMy brothers are ready. Cai He is posted on the road to the
Xian Hills from the east gate; Cai Zhong and Cai Xun are on the north and south
roads. No guard is needed on the west as the Tan Torrent is quite safeguard
enough. Even with legions, Liu Bei could not get over that.â
Kuai Yue replied, âI notice that Zhao Zilong never leaves him. I feel sure he
expects some attack.â
âI have placed five hundred men in ambush in the city.â
âWe will tell Wen Ping and Wang Wei to invite all the military officers to a
banquet at one of the pavilions outside the city, and Zhao Zilong will be among
them. Then will be our opportunity.â
Cai Mao thought this a good device for getting Zhao Zilong out of the way.
Now oxen and horses had been slaughtered and a grand banquet prepared. Liu Bei
rode to the residence on the horse of ill omen, and when he arrived, the steed
was led into the back part of the enclosure and tethered there. Soon the guests
arrived, and Liu Bei took his place as master of the feast, with the two sons
of the Imperial Protector, one on each side. The guests were all arranged in
order of rank. Zhao Zilong stood near his lord sword in hand as a faithful
henchman should do.
Then Wen Ping and Wang Wei came to invite Zhao Zilong to the banquet they had
prepared for the military officers. But he declined. However, Liu Bei told him
to go, and, after some demur, he went. Then Cai Mao perfected his final
arrangements, placing his people surrounding the place like a ring of iron. The
three hundred guards that formed the escort of Liu Bei were sent away to the
guest-house.
All were ready and awaiting the signal. At the third course, Yi Ji took a
goblet of wine in his hands and approached Liu Bei, at the same time giving him
a meaningful look. Then in a low voice he said, âMake an excuse to get
away.â
Liu Bei understood and presently rose and went to the inner chamber, and then
he went to the backyard. There he found Yi Ji, who had gone thither after
presenting the cup of wine.
Yi Ji then told him, saying, âCai Mao plots to kill you, and all the roads
have been guarded except that to the west. My lord, you must lose no time to
depart.â
Liu Bei was quite taken aback. However, he got hold of the Dilu horse, opened
the door of the garden, and led it out. Then he took a flying leap into the
saddle and galloped off without waiting for the escort. He made for the west
gate. At the gate the wardens wanted to question him, but he only whipped up
his steed and rode through. The guards at the gate ran off to report to Cai
Mao, who quickly went in pursuit with five hundred soldiers.
As has been said Liu Bei burst out at the west gate. Before he had gone far,
there rolled before him a river barring the way. It was the Tan Torrent, many
score spans in width, which pours its waters into the River Xiang. Its current
was very swift.
Liu Bei reached the bank and saw the river was unfordable. So he turned his
horse and rode back. Then, not far off, he saw a cloud of dust and knew that
his pursuers were therein. He thought that it was all over. However, he turned
again toward the swift river, and seeing the soldiers now quite near, plunged
into the stream. A few paces, and he felt the horseâs fore legs floundering
in front, while the water rose over the skirt of his robe.
Then he plied the whip furiously, crying, âDilu, Dilu, why betray me?â
Whereupon the good steed suddenly reared up out of the water and, with one
tremendous leap, was on the western bank. Liu Bei felt as if he had come out of
the clouds.
In after years the famous court official, Su Dongpo, wrote a poem on this leap
over the Tan Torrent:
Iâm growing old, the leaves are sere,
My sun slopes westward, soon will sink,
And I recall that yesteryear
I wandered by Tan River brink.
Irresolute, anon I paused,
Anon advanced, and gazed around,
I marked the autumnâs reddened leaves,
And watched them eddying to the ground.
I thought of all the mighty deeds
Of him who set the House of Han
On high, and all the struggles since,
The battlefields, the blood that ran.
I saw the nobles gathered round
The board, set in the Banquet Hall;
Amid them, one, above whose head
There hung a sword about to fall.
I saw him quit that festive throng
And westward ride, a lonely way;
I saw a squadron follow swift,
Intent the fugitive to slay.
I saw him reach the River Tan,
Whose swirling current rushes by;
Adown the bank he galloped fast,
âNow leap, my steed!â I heard him cry.
His steedâs hoofs churn the swollen stream;
What chills he that the waves run high?
He hears the sound of clashing steel,
Of thundering squadrons coming nigh.
And upward from the foaming waves
I saw two peerless beings soar;
One was a destined western king,
And him another dragon bore.
The Tan still rolls from east to west.
Its roaring torrent never dry.
Those dragons twain, ah! Where are they?
Yes, where? But there is no reply.
The setting sun, in dark relief
Against the glowing western sky.
Throws out the everlasting hills
While, saddened, here I stand and sigh.
Humans died to found the kingdoms three,
Which now as misty dreams remain.
Of greatest deeds the traces oft
Are faint that fleeting years retain.
Thus Liu Bei crossed the rolling river. Then he turned and looked back at the
other bank which his pursuers had just gained.
âWhy did you run sway from the feast?â called out Cai Mao.
âWhy did you wish to harm a person who has done you no injury?â replied Liu
Bei.
âI have never thought of such a thing. Do not listen to what people say to
you.â
But Liu Bei saw that his enemy was fitting an arrow to his bowstring, so he
whipped up his steed and rode away southwest.
âWhat spirits aided him?â said Cai Mao to his followers.
Then Cai Mao turned to go back to the city, but in the gate he saw Zhao Zilong
coming out at the head of his company of guards.
By wondrous leap the dragon steed his riderâs life could save,
Now follows him, on vengeance bent, his masterâs henchman brave.
The next chapters will tell what fate befell the traitor.

hundred coming out. It had happened that, while at the banquet, Zhao Zilong had
noticed some movement of soldiers and horses and had at once gone to the
banquet-hall to see if all was well with his lord. Missing Liu Bei from his
place, Zhao Zilong had become anxious and gone to the guest-house. There he
heard that Cai Mao had gone off to the west gate with troops. So he quickly
took his spear, mounted and went, he and the escort, in hot haste along the
same road.
Meeting Cai Mao near the gate, he said, âWhere is my lord?â
âHe left the banquet-hall quite suddenly, and I know not whither he has
gone,â was the reply.
Now Zhao Zilong was cautious and careful and had no desire to act hastily, so
he urged his horse forward till he came to the river. There he was checked by a
torrent without ford or bridge.
At once he turned back and shouted after Cai Mao, âYou invited my lord to a
feast. What means this going after him with a squadron of horse?â
Cai Mao replied, âIt is my duty to guard the officials of forty-two counties
who have assembled here, as I am the Chief Commander.â
âWhither have you driven my lord?â asked Zhao Zilong.
âThey tell me he rode quite alone out through the west gate, but I have not
seen him.â
Zhao Zilong was anxious and doubtful. Again he rode to the river and looked
around. This time he noticed a wet track on the farther side. He thought to
himself that it was almost an impossible crossing for a person and a horse, so
he ordered his followers to scatter and search. But they also could find no
trace of Liu Bei.
Zhao Zilong turned again to the city. By the time he had reached the wall, Cai
Mao had gone within. He then questioned the gate wardens, and they all agreed
in saying that Liu Bei had ridden out at full gallop. That was all they knew.
Fearing to reenter the city lest he should fall into an ambush, Zhao Zilong
started for Xinye.
After that marvelous life-saving leap over the Tan Torrent, Liu Bei felt elated
but rather dazed.
He could not help telling himself, âMy safety is due to an especial
interposition of Providence.â
Following a tortuous path, he urged his steed toward Nanzhang. But the sun sank
to the west and his destination seemed yet a long way off. Then he saw a young
cowherd seated on the back of a buffalo and playing on a short flute.
âIf I were only as happy!â sighed Liu Bei.
He checked his horse and looked at the lad, who stopped his beast, ceased
playing on the pipe, and stared fixedly at the stranger.
âYou must be Liu Bei, the general who fought the Yellow Scarves,â said the
boy presently.
Liu Bei was taken aback.
âHow can you know my name, a young rustic like you living in such a secluded
place?â said he.
âOf course I do not know you, but my master often has visitors, and they all
talk about Liu Bei, the tall man whose hands hang down below his knees and
whose eyes are very prominent. They say he is the most famous man of the day.
Now you, General, are just such a man as they talk about, and surely you are
he.â
âWell, who is your master?â
âMy masterâs name is Sima Hui. He belongs to Yingchuan and his Daoist
appellation is Water Mirror.â
âWho are your masterâs friends that you mentioned?â
âThey are Pang Degong and Pang Tong of Xiangyang.â
âAnd who are they?â
âUncle and nephew. Pang Degong is ten years older than my master; the other
is five years younger. One day my master was up in a tree picking mulberries
when Pang Tong arrived. They began to talk and kept it up all day, my master
did not come down till the evening. My master is very fond of Pang Tong and
calls him brother.â
âAnd where does your master live?â
âIn that wood there, in front,â said the cowherd pointing to it. âThere
he has a farmstead.â
âI really am Liu Bei, and you might lead me to your master that I may salute
him.â
The cowherd led the way for about one mile, when Liu Bei found himself in front
of a farm house. He dismounted and went to the center door. Suddenly came to
his ear the sound of a lute most skillfully played and the air was extremely
beautiful. He stopped his guide and would not allow him to announce a visitor,
but stood there rapt by the melody.
Suddenly the music ceased.
He heard a deep laugh and a man appeared, saying, âAmidst the clear and
subtle sounds of the lute, there suddenly rang out a high note as though some
noble man was near.â
âThat is my master,â said the lad pointing.
Liu Bei saw before him a figure slender and straight as a pine tree, a very
saint-like being. Hastening forward he saluted. The skirt of his robe was still
wet from the river.
âYou have escaped from a grave danger today, Sir,â said Water Mirror.
Liu Bei was startled into silence, and the cowherd said to his master, âThis
is Liu Bei.â
Water Mirror asked him to enter; and when they were seated in their relative
positions as host and guest, Liu Bei glanced round the room. Upon the
bookshelves were piled books and manuscripts. The window opened upon an
exquisite picture of pines and bamboos and a lute lay upon a stone couch. The
room showed refinement in its last degree.
âWhence come you, Illustrious Sir?â asked the host.
âBy chance I was passing this way and the lad pointed you out to me. So I
came to bow in your honored presence. I cannot tell what pleasure it gives
me.â
Water Mirror laughed, saying, âWhy this mystery? Why must you conceal the
truth? You have certainly just escaped from a grave danger.â
Then Liu Bei told the story of the banquet and the flight.
âI knew it all from your appearance,â said his host. âYour name has long
been familiar, but whence comes it that, up to the present, you are only a
homeless devil?â
âI have suffered many a check during my life,â said Liu Bei, âand through
one of them am I here now.â
âIt should not be so. But the reason is that you still lack the one person to
aid you.â
âI am simple enough in myself, I know. But I have Sun Qian, Mi Zhu, and Jian
Yong on the civil side, and for warriors I have Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhao
Zilong. These are all most loyal helpers, and I depend upon them not a
little.â
âYour fighting generals are good: Fit to oppose a legion. The pity is you
have no really able adviser. Your civilians are but pallid students of books,
not people fitted to weave and control destiny.â
âI have always yearned to find one of those marvelous recluses who live among
the hills till their day arrive. So far I have sought in vain.â
âYou know what the Teacher Confucius said, âIn a hamlet of ten households
there must be one true person.â Can you say there is no one?â
âI am simple and uninstructed. I pray you enlighten me.â
âYou have heard what the street children sing:
âIn eight and nine years begins decay,
Four years, then comes the fateful day,
When destiny will show the way,
And the dragon flies out of the mire!
âThis song was first heard when the new reign style was adopted. The first
line was fulfilled when Imperial Protector Liu Biao lost his first wife, and
when his family troubles began. The next line relates to the approaching death
of Liu Biao, and there is not a single person among all his crowd of officers
who has the least ability. The last two lines will be fulfilled in you,
General.â
Liu Bei started up in surprise, crying, âHow could such a thing be?â
Water Mirror continued, âAt this moment the marvelously clever people of the
earth are all here and you, Sir, ought to seek them.â
âWhere are they? Who are they?â said Liu Bei quickly.
âIf you could find either Sleeping Dragon or Young Phoenix, you could restore
order in the empire.â
âBut who are these two?â
His host clapped his hands, smiled and said, âGood, very good!â
When Liu Bei persisted and pressed home his questions, Water Mirror said, âIt
is getting late. You might stay the night here, General, and we will talk over
these things tomorrow.â
He called to a lad to bring wine and food for his guest and his horse was taken
to the stable and fed. After Liu Bei had eaten, he was shown to a chamber
opening off the main room and went to bed. But the words of his host would not
be banished, and he lay there only dozing till far into the night.
Suddenly he became fully awake at the sound of a knock at the door and a person
entering. And he heard his host say, âWhere are you from?â
Liu Bei rose from his couch and listened secretly.
He heard the visitor reply, âIt has long been said that Liu Biao treated good
people and bad people as they each should be treated. So I went to see for
myself. But that reputation is undeserved. He does treat good people correctly
but he cannot use them, and he treats wicked people in the right way, all but
dismissing them. So I left a letter for him and went away. And here I am.â
Water Mirror replied, âYou, capable enough to be the adviser of a king, ought
to be able to find someone fit to serve. Why did you cheapen yourself so far as
to go to Liu Biao? Beside, there is a real hero right under your eyes and you
do not know him.â
âIt is just as you say,â replied the stranger.
Liu Bei listened with great joy for he thought this visitor was certainly one
of the two he was advised to look for. Liu Bei would have shown himself then
and there, but he thought that would look strange. So he waited till daylight,
when he sought out his host.
âWho was it came last night?â said Liu Bei.
âA friend of mine,â was the reply.
Liu Bei begged for an introduction. Water Mirror said, âHe wants to find an
enlightened master, and so he has gone elsewhere.â
When Liu Bei asked his name, his host only replied, âGood, good!â
And when Liu Bei asked who they were who went by the names of Sleeping Dragon
and Young Phoenix, he only elicited the same reply.
Liu Bei then, bowing low before his host, begged him to leave the hills and
help him to bring about the restoration of the ruling house to its
prerogatives.
But Water Mirror replied, âPeople of the hills and woods are unequal to such
a task. However, there must be many far abler than I who will help you if you
seek them.â
While they were talking, they heard outside the farm the shouts of troops and
neighing of horses, and a servant came in to say that a general with a large
company of soldiers had arrived. Liu Bei went out hastily to see who these were
and found Zhao Zilong. He was much relieved, and Zhao Zilong dismounted and
entered the house.
âLast night, on my return to Xinye,â said Zhao Zilong, âI could not find
you, my lord, so I followed at once and traced you here. I pray you return
quickly, as I fear an attack on the city.â
So Liu Bei took leave of his host, and the whole company returned to Xinye.
Before they had gone far another army appeared, and, when they had come nearer,
they saw Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. They met with great joy, and Liu Bei told them
of the wonderful leap his horse had made over the torrent. All expressed
surprise and pleasure.
As soon as they reached the city, a council was called and Zhao Zilong said,
âYou ought first of all to indite a letter to Liu Biao telling him all these
things.â
The letter was prepared and Sun Qian bore it to the seat of government in
Jingzhou City. He was received, and Liu Biao at once asked the reason of Liu
Bei hasty flight from the festival. Whereupon the letter was presented, and the
bearer related the machinations of Cai Mao and told of the escape and the
amazing leap over the Tan Torrent.
Liu Biao was very angry, sent for Cai Mao, and berated him soundly, saying,
âHow dare you try to hurt my brother?â
And he ordered Cai Mao out to execution.
Liu Biaoâs wife, Cai Maoâs sister, prayed for a remission of the death
penalty, but Liu Biao refused to be appeased.
Then spoke Sun Qian, saying, âIf you put Cai Mao to death, I fear Uncle Liu
Bei will be unable to remain here.â
Then Cai Mao was reprieved, but dismissed with a severe reprimand.
Liu Biao sent his elder son Liu Qi back with Sun Qian to apologize. When Liu Qi
reached Xinye, Liu Bei welcomed him and gave a banquet in his honor.
After some little drinking, the chief guest suddenly began to weep and
presently said, âMy step mother, Lady Cai, always cherishes a wish to put me
out of the way, and I do not know how to avoid her anger. Could you advise me,
Uncle?â
Liu Bei exhorted him to be careful and perfectly filial and nothing could
happen. Soon after, the young man took his leave and wept at parting.
Liu Bei escorted Liu Qi well on his way and, pointing to his steed, said, âI
owe my life to this horse. Had it not been for him, I had been already below
the Nine Golden Springs.â
âIt was not the strength of the horse, but your noble fortune, Uncle.â
They parted, the young man weeping bitterly. On reentering the city, Liu Bei
met a person in the street wearing a hempen turban, a cotton robe confined by a
black girdle, and black shoes. He came along singing a song:
âThe universe is rived, O! Now nears the end of all.
The noble mansion quakes, O! What beam can stay the fall?
A wise one waits his lord, O! But hidden in the glen,
The seeker knows not him, O! Nor me, of common humans.â
Liu Bei listened.
âSurely this is one of the people Water Mirror spoke of,â thought he.
He dismounted, spoke to the singer, and invited him into his residence. Then
when they were seated, he asked the strangerâs name.
âI am from Yingchuan, and my name is Shan Fu. I have known you by repute for
a long time, and they said you appreciated humans of ability. I wanted to come
to you but every way of getting an introduction seemed closed. So I bethought
me of attracting your notice by singing that song in the market place.â
Liu Bei thought he had found a treasure and treated the newcomer with the
greatest kindness. Then Shan Fu spoke of the horse that he had seen Liu Bei
riding and asked to look at it. So the animal was brought round.
âIs not this a Dilu horse?â said Shan Fu. âBut though it is a good steed,
it risks his master. You must not ride it.â
âIt has already fulfilled the omens,â said Liu Bei, and he related the
story of the leap over the Tan Torrent.
âBut that was saving his master, not risking him. It will surely harm someone
in the end. But I can tell you how to avert the omen.â
âI should be glad to hear it,â said Liu Bei.
âIf you have an enemy against whom you bear a grudge, give him this horse and
wait till it has fulfilled the evil omens on this person, then you can ride it
in safety.â
Liu Bei changed color.
âWhat, Sir! You are but a new acquaintance, and you would advise me to take
an evil course and to harm another for my own advantage? No, Sir! I cannot
listen.â
His guest smiled, saying, âPeople said you were virtuous. I could not ask you
directly, so I put it that way to test you.â
Liu Beiâs expression changed. He rose and returned the compliment, saying,
âBut how can I be virtuous while I lack your teaching?â
âWhen I arrived here, I heard the people saying:
âSince Liu Bei came here, O blessed day!
Weâve had good luck, long may he stay!
âSo you see, the effects of your virtue extend to the ordinary people.â
Thereupon Shan Fu was made Commanding Adviser of the army.
The one idea that held Cao Cao after his return from Jizhou was the capture of
Jingzhou. He sent Cao Ren and Li Dian, with the two brothers Lu Xiang and Lu
Kuang who had surrendered, to camp at Fancheng with thirty thousand troops and
so threaten Jingzhou and Xiangyang. Thence he sent spies to find out the weak
points.
Then the two Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang petitioned Cao Ren, saying, âLiu Bei is
strengthening his position at Xinye and laying in large supplies. Some great
scheme is afoot, and he should be checked. Since our surrender we have
performed no noteworthy service and, if you will give us five thousand
soldiers, we promise to bring you the head of Liu Bei.â
Cao Ren was only too glad, and the expedition set out. The scouts reported this
to Liu Bei who turned to Shan Fu for advice.
Shan Fu said, âThey must not be permitted to cross the boundary. Send Guan Yu
and Zhang Fei left and right, each with one thousand troops, one to attack the
enemy on the march, the other to cut off the retreat. You and Zhao Zilong will
make a front attack.â
Guan Yu and Zhang Fei started, and then Liu Bei went out at the gate with two
thousand troops to oppose the enemy. Before they had gone far they saw a great
cloud of dust behind the hills. This marked the approach of the Lu brothers.
Presently, both sides being arrayed, Liu Bei rode out and stood by his
standard.
He called out, âWho are you who thus would encroach on my territory?â
âI am the great General Lu Kuang, and I have the order of the Prime Minister
to make you prisoner!â said the leader.
Liu Bei ordered Zhao Zilong to go out, and the two generals engaged. Very soon
Zhao Zilong with a spear thrust had disposed of his opponent, and Liu Bei gave
the signal to attack. Lu Xiang could not maintain his position and led his
troops off. Soon his force found themselves attacked by an army rushing in from
the side led by Guan Yu. The loss was more than a half, and the remainder fled
for safety.
About three miles farther on they found their retreat barred by an army under
Zhang Fei, who stood in the way with a long spear ready to thrust, crying out,
âZhang Fei is waiting!â
Zhang Fei bore down upon Lu Xiang, who was slain without a chance of striking a
blow. The troops again fled in disorder. They were pursued by Liu Bei, and the
greater part killed or captured.
Then Liu Bei returned into Xinye where he rewarded Shan Fu and feasted his
victorious soldiers.
Some of the defeated troops took the news of the deaths of the leaders and the
capture of their comrades to Cao Ren at Fancheng.
Cao Ren, much distressed, consulted Li Dian who advised, saying, âThe loss is
due to our underestimation of our enemy. Now we should stay where we are, hold
on, and request reinforcements.â
âNot so,â said Cao Ren. âWe cannot support calmly the death of two
leaders and the loss of so many soldiers. We must avenge them quickly. Xinye is
but a crossbow-slug of a place and not worth disturbing the Prime Minister
for.â
âLiu Bei is a man of metal,â said Li Dian. âDo not esteem him lightly.â
âWhat are you afraid of?â said Cao Ren.
âThe Rule of War says âTo know your enemy and yourself is the secret of
victory,ââ replied Li Dian. âI am not afraid of the battle, but I do not
think we can conquer.â
âYou are a traitor!â cried Cao Ren angrily. âThen I will capture Liu Bei
myself.â
âDo so. I will guard this city,â said Li Dian.
âIf you do not go with me, it is a proof that you are a traitor,â retorted
Cao Ren.
At this reproach, Li Dian felt constrained to join the expedition. So they told
off twenty five thousand troops with which they crossed the River Yu for Xinye.
The officers all keenly felt the shame of many slain,
The chief determines on revenge and marches out again.
What measure of success the expedition met with will be related in the next
chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 36 ****
In hot anger, Cao Ren lost no time in marching out to avenge the loss of so
many of his army. He hastily crossed the River Yu to attack Xinye and trample
it in the dust.
When Shan Fu got back into the city, he said to Liu Bei, âWhen Cao Ren, now
at Fancheng, hears of his losses, he will try to retrieve them and will come to
attack us.â
âWhat is the counter move?â asked Liu Bei.
âAs he will come with all his force, his own city will be left undefended. We
will surprise it.â
âBy what ruse?â
The adviser leaned over and whispered to his chief. Whatever the plan was, it
pleased Liu Bei, who made arrangements. Soon the scouts reported Cao Ren
crossing the river with a mighty host.
âJust as I guessed,â said Shan Fu, hearing of it.
Then he suggested that Liu Bei should lead out one army against the invaders.
Liu Bei did so, and, when the formation was complete, Zhao Zilong rode to the
front as champion and challenged the other side.
Li Dian rode out and engaged. At about the tenth bout Li Dian found he was
losing and retired toward his own side. Zhao Zilong pressed after him, but was
checked by a heavy discharge of arrows from the wings. Then both sides stopped
the battle and retired to their camps.
Li Dian reported to his chief: âOur enemy are brave, very full of spirit, and
we will be hard to overcome. We had better retreat to Fancheng and wait for
reinforcements.â
Cao Ren angrily replied, âYou damped the armyâs spirit before we started,
and now you betray us. You have been bought, and you deserve death.â
Cao Ren called in the executioners, and they led away their victim. But the
other officers came to intercede, and Li Dian was spared. However, he was
transferred to the command of the rear, while Cao Ren himself led the attack.
Next day the drums beat an advance and Cao Ren, having drawn up his soldiers,
sent a messenger over to ask if Liu Bei recognized his plan of battle array.
So Shan Fu went on a hill and looked over it.
Then he said to Liu Bei, âThe arrangement is called âThe Eight Docked
Gates,â and the names of the gates are Birth, Exit, Expanse, Wound, Fear,
Annihilation, Obstacle, and Death. If you enter by one of the three Birth,
Exit, or Expanse you succeed. If by one of the gates Wound, Fear, or
Annihilation, you sustain injuries. The other two gates Obstacles and Death
will bring the end. Now, though the eight gates are all there quite correct,
the central key-post is lacking, and the whole formation can be thrown into
confusion by entry from the southeast and exit due west.â
Wherefore certain orders were issued and Zhao Zilong, leading five hundred
troops, rode out on his prancing steed to break the array. He burst in, as
directed, at the southeast and, with great clamor and fighting, reached the
center. Cao Ren made for the north, but Zhao Zilong, instead of following him,
made a dash westward and got through. Thence he turned round to the southeast
again and smote till Cao Renâs army was in disarray. Liu Bei gave a general
advance signal, and the victory was complete. The beaten enemy retired.
Shan Fu forbade pursuit, and they returned. The loss of the battle convinced
Cao Ren of the wisdom of his colleague Li Dian, and he sent for Li Dian to
consult.
âThey certainly have some very able person in Liu Beiâs army since my
formation was so quickly broken,â said Cao Ren.
âMy chief anxiety is about Fancheng,â said Li Dian.
âI will raid their camp this night,â said Cao Ren. âIf I succeed, we will
decide upon what should be done next. If I fail, we will return to Fancheng.â
âTheir camp will be well prepared against such a thing, and you will fail,â
said Li Dian.
âHow can you expect to fight successfully when you are so full of doubts?â
said Cao Ren, angrily.
He held no more converse with his cautious colleague, but himself took command
of the van and set out. Li Dian was relegated to the rear. The attack on the
enemyâs camp was fixed for the second watch.
Now as Shan Fu was discussing plans with his chief a whirlwind from the
northeast went by, which Shan Fu said, âThere will be a raid on the camp
tonight.â
âHow shall we meet it?â said Liu Bei.
âThe plans are quite ready,â was the reply.
Shan Fu whispered them to the chief. So at the second watch, when the enemy
arrived, they saw fires on all sides, the stockades and huts burning. Cao Ren
understood at once that all hope of a surprise was vain, and he turned to get
away as quickly as possible. This was the signal for Zhao Zilong to fall on,
and that cut Cao Renâs return road. He hastened north toward the river, and
reached the bank, but, while waiting for boats to cross the stream, up came
Zhang Fei and attacked.
By dint of great efforts and with the support of Li Dian, Cao Ren got into a
boat, but most of the soldiers were drowned in the stream. As soon as he got to
the farther shore, he bolted for Fancheng. He reached the wall and hailed the
gate, but, instead of a friendly welcome, he heard the rolling of drums, which
was soon followed by the appearance of a body of troops. Guan Yu led them.
âI took the city a long time ago!â shouted Guan Yu.
This was a severe shock to Cao Ren, who turned to flee. As soon as he faced
about, Guan Yu attacked and killed many of his force. The remnant hastened to
Xuchang. On the road the beaten general wondered who had advised his opponents
with such success, and he asked the natives for the answer.
While the defeated Cao Ren had to find his way back to the capital, Liu Bei had
scored a great success. Afterwards he marched to Fancheng, where he was
welcomed by Magistrate Liu Mi, himself a scion of the ruling family, who had
been born in Changsha. Liu Mi received Liu Bei as a guest in his own house and
gave banquets and treated him exceedingly well.
In the train of the Magistrate, Liu Bei saw a very handsome and distinguished-
looking young man, and asked who he was.
Liu Mi replied, âHe is my nephew, Kou Feng, son of Lord Kou of Luo. I have
taken care of him after his parents died.â
Liu Bei had taken a great liking for the lad and proposed to adopt him. His
guardian was willing, and so the adoption was arranged. The young manâs name
was changed to Liu Feng. When Liu Bei left, he took his adopted son with him.
Liu Feng was then made to bow before Guan Yu and Zhang Fei as uncles.
Guan Yu was doubtful of the wisdom of adopting another son, saying, âYou have
a son. Why do you think it necessary to adopt another? It may cause
confusion.â
âHow? I shall treat him as a father should, and he will serve me as befits a
son.â
Guan Yu was displeased.
Then Liu Bei and Shan Fu began further discussions of strategy, and they
decided to leave Zhao Zilong with one thousand soldiers to guard Fancheng, and
they returned to Xinye.
In the meantime Cao Caoâs defeated generals had gone back. When they saw the
Prime Minister, Cao Ren threw himself on the ground weeping and acknowledging
his faults. He told the tale of his losses.
âThe fortune of war,â said Cao Cao. âBut I should like to know who laid
Liu Beiâs plans.â
âThat was Shan Fu,â said Cao Ren.
âWho is he?â asked Cao Cao.
Cheng Yu said, âThe man is not Shan Fu. When young this man was fond of
fencing and used to take up the quarrels of other people and avenge their
wrongs. At the end of Emperor Ling, he killed a man to avenge his friend, and
then he let down his hair, muddled his face, and was trying to escape when a
lictor caught him and questioned him. He would not reply. So they carted him
through the streets beating a drum and asking if anyone recognized him. Nobody
dared own to knowing him, even if they did so. However, his comrades managed to
release him secretly, and he ran away under some other name. Then he turned to
study and wandered hither and thither wherever scholars were to be found. He
was a regular disputant with Sima Hui. His real name is Xu Shu and he comes
from Yingchuan. Shan Fu is merely an assumed name.â
âHow does he compare with yourself?â asked Cao Cao.
âTen times cleverer.â
âIt is a pity. If able people gather to Liu Bei, his wings will soon grow.
What is to be done?â
âXu Shu is there now. But if you wanted him, it would not be difficult to
call him,â replied Cheng Yu.
âHow could I make him come?â said Cao Cao.
âHe is noted for his affection for his mother. His father died young, leaving
his mother a widow with one other son. Now that son is dead, and his mother,
Lady Xun, has no one to care for her. If you sent and got his mother here and
told her to write and summon her son, he would surely come.â
Cao Cao sent without loss of time and had the old lady brought to the capital,
where he treated her exceedingly well.
Presently he said, âI hear you have a very talented son, who is now at Xinye
helping on that rebel Liu Bei against the government. There he is like a jewel
in a muck heap: It is a pity. Supposing you were to call him, I could speak of
him before the Emperor, and he might get an important office.â
Cao Cao bade his secretaries bring along paper and ink, with which Lady Xun
could write to her son.
âWhat sort of a man is Liu Bei?â asked she.
Cao Cao replied, âA common sort of person from Zhuo, irresponsible enough to
style himself Imperial Uncle, and so claiming some sort of connection with the
Hans. He is neither trustworthy nor virtuous. People say he is a superior man
as far as externals go, but a mean man by nature.â
Lady Xun answered in a hard voice, âWhy do you malign him so bitterly?
Everyone knows he is a descendant of one of the Han princes and so related to
the House. He has condescended to take a lowly office and is respectful to all
people. He has a reputation for benevolence. Everyone, young and old, cowherds
and firewood cutters, all know him by name and know that he is the finest and
noblest man in the world. If my son is in his service, then has he found a
fitting master. You, under the name of a Han minister, are really nothing but a
Han rebel. Contrary to all truths, you tell me Liu Bei is a rebel, whereby you
try to induce me to make my son leave the light for darkness. Are you devoid of
all sense of shame?â
As Lady Xun finished speaking, she picked up the inkstone to strike Cao Cao.
This so enraged him that he forgot himself and the need for caution and bade
the executioners lead off the old woman and put her to death.
Adviser Cheng Yu, however, stopped this act, saying, âThis old lady wished to
die. But if you kill her, your reputation will be damaged and hers enhanced.
Beside that will add a keen desire for revenge to the motives which led Xu Shu
to labor in the interest of Liu Bei. You had better keep her here so that Xu
Shuâs body and his thoughts may be in different places. He can not devote all
his energies to helping our enemy while his mother is here. If you keep her, I
think I can persuade the son to come and help you.â
So the outspoken old lady was saved. She was given quarters and cared for.
Daily Cheng Yu went to ask after her health, falsely claiming to being a sworn
brother of her sonâs, and so entitled to serve her and treat her as a filial
son would have done. He often sent her gifts and wrote letters to her so that
she had to write in reply. And thereby he learned her handwriting so that he
could forge a âhomeâ letter. When he could do this without fear of
detection, he wrote one and sent it by the hand of a trusty person to Xinye.
One day a man arrived inquiring for one Shan Fu. He claimed to have a letter
from home for him. The soldiers led the man to Shan Fu. The man said he was an
official carrier of letters and had been told to bring this one. Shan Fu
quickly tore it open and read:
âOn your brotherâs death recently I was left alone: No relative was near,
and I was lonely and sad. To my regret, the Prime Minister Cao Cao inveigled me
into coming to the capital, and now he says you are a rebel, and he has thrown
me into bonds. However, thanks to Cheng Yu, my life has been spared so far,
and, if you would only come and submit too, I should be quite safe. When this
reaches you, remember how I have toiled for you and come at once, that you may
prove yourself a filial son. We may together find some way of escape to our own
place and avoid the dangers that threaten me. My life hangs by a thread, and I
look to you to save me. You will not require a second summon.â
Tears gushed from Xu Shuâs eyes as he read, and with the letter in his hand
he went to seek his chief, to whom he told the true story of his life.
âI heard that Liu Biao treated people well and went to him. I happened to
arrive at a time of confusion. I saw he was of no use, so I left him very soon.
I arrived at the retreat of Sima Hui the Water Mirror late one night and told
him, and he blamed me for not knowing a master when I saw one. Then he told me
of you and I sang that wild song in the streets to attract your attention. You
took me; you used me. But now my aged mother is the victim of Cao Caoâs
wiles. She is in prison, and he threatens to do worse. She has written to call
me, and I must go. I hoped to be able to render you faithful service, but, with
my dear mother a captive, I should be useless. Therefore I must leave you and
hope in the future to meet you again.â
Liu Bei broke into loud moans when he heard that his adviser was to leave.
âThe bond between mother and son is divine,â said Liu Bei, âand I do not
need to be reminded where your duty lies. When you have seen your venerable
mother, perhaps I may have again the happiness of receiving your
instruction.â
Having said farewell, Xu Shu prepared to leave at once. However, at Liu Beiâs
wish, he consented to stay over the night.
Then Sun Qian said privately to his master, âXu Shu is indeed a genius, but
he has been here long enough to know all our secrets. If you let him go over to
Cao Cao, he will be in his confidence, and that will be to our detriment. You
ought to keep him at all costs and not let him go. When Cao Cao sees Xu Shu
does not come, he will put the mother to death, and that will make Xu Shu the
more zealous in your service, for he will burn to avenge his motherâs
death.â
âI cannot do that. It would be very cruel and vile to procure the death of
his mother that I might retain the sonâs services. If I kept him, it would
lead to a rupture of the parental lien, and that would be a sin I would rather
die than commit.â
Both were grieved and sighed.
Liu Bei asked the parting guest to a banquet, but he declined, saying, âWith
my mother a prisoner I can swallow nothing, nay, though it were brewed from
gold or distilled from jewels.â
âAlas! Your departure is as if I lost both my hands,â said Liu Bei. âEven
the liver of a dragon or the marrow of a phoenix would be bitter in my
mouth.â
They looked into each otherâs eyes and wept. They sat silent till dawn. When
all was ready for the journey, the two rode out of the city side by side. At
Daisy Pavilion they dismounted to drink the stirrup cup.
Liu Bei lifted the goblet and said, âIt is my mean fortune that separates me
from you, but I hope that you may serve well your new lord and become
famous.â
Xu Shu wept as he replied, âI am but a poor ignorant person whom you have
kindly employed. Unhappily I have to break our intercourse in the middle, but
my venerable mother is the real cause. Though Cao Cao use all manner of means
to coerce me, yet will I never plan for him.â
âAfter you are gone, I shall only bury myself in the hills and hide in the
forests,â said Liu Bei.
Xu Shu said, âI had in my heart for you the position of leader of the
chieftains, but my plans have been altogether upset by my mother. I have been
of no advantage to you, nor should I do any good by remaining. But you ought to
seek some person of lofty wisdom to help you in your great enterprise. It is
unseemly to be downcast.â
âI shall find none to help better than you, my master.â
âHow can I permit such extravagant praise?â said Xu Shu. âI am only a
useless blockhead.â
As he moved off, he said to the followers, âOfficers, I hope you will render
the Princely One good service, whereby to write his name large in the
countryâs annals and cause his fame to glow in the pages of history. Do not
be like me, a person who has left his work half done.â
They were all deeply affected. Liu Bei could not bring himself to part from his
friend. He escorted him a little further, and yet a little further, till Xu Shu
said, âI will not trouble you, O Princely One, to come further. Let us say
our farewell here.â
Liu Bei dismounted, took Xu Shu by the hands, and said, âAlas! We part. Each
goes his way, and who knows if we shall meet again?â
His tears fell like rain and Xu Shu wept also. But the last goodbyes were said.
When the traveler had gone, Liu Bei stood gazing after the little party and
watched it slowly disappear. At the last glimpse he broke into lamentation.
âHe is gone! What shall I do?â
One of the trees shut out the traveler from his sight, and Liu Bei pointed at
it, saying, âWish that I could cut down every tree in the countryside!â
âWhy?â said his officers.
âBecause they hinder my sight of Xu Shu.â
Suddenly they saw Xu Shu galloping back.
Said Liu Bei, âHe is returning: Can it be that he is going to stay?â
So he hastened forward to meet Xu Shu, and when they got near enough, he cried,
âThis return is surely for no slight reason.â
Checking his horse, Xu Shu said, âIn the turmoil of my feelings, I forgot to
say one word. There is a person of wonderful skill living about seven miles
from the city of Xiangyang. Why not seek him?â
âCan I trouble you to ask him to visit me?â
âHe will not condescend to visit you. You must go to him. But if he consents,
you will be as fortunate as the Zhou when they got the aid of Lu Wang, or the
Han when Zhang Liang came to help.â
âHow does the unknown compare with yourself?â
âWith me? Compared with him I am as a worn-out carthorse to a palomino, an
old duck to a phoenix. This man often compares himself with the ancient sages
Guan Zhong and Yue Yi but, in my opinion, he is far their superior. He has the
talent to measure the heavens and mete the earth. He is a man who overshadows
every other in the world.â
âI would know his name.â
âHe belongs to Langye, and his name is Zhuge Liang. He is of the family of
the former General Zhuge Feng. His father, Zhuge Gui, was the Deputy Governor
of Taishan but died young, and the young fellow went with his uncle Zhuge Xuan
to Jingzhou. Imperial Protector Liu Biao was an old friend of his uncle, and
Zhuge Liang became settled in Xiangyang. Then his uncle died, and he and his
younger brother, Zhuge Jun, returned to their farm in Nanyang and worked as
farmers. They used to amuse themselves with the composition of songs in the
Liangfu style.
âOn their land was a ridge of hills called the Sleeping Dragon, and the elder
of the brothers took it as a name and called himself Master Sleeping Dragon.
This is your man. He is a veritable genius. You ought really to visit him. And
if he will help you, you need feel no more anxiety about peace in the
empire.â
âWater Mirror spoke that time of two persons, Sleeping Dragon and Young
Phoenix, and said if only one of them could be got to help me all would be
well. Surely he, whom you speak of, is one of them.â
âYoung Phoenix is Pang Tong of Xiangyang, and Sleeping Dragon is Zhuge
Liang.â
Liu Bei jumped with delight, âNow at last I know who the mysterious ones are.
How I wish they were here! But for you I should have still been an unclued
man,â said he.
Someone has celebrated in verse this interview where Xu Shu from horseback
recommended Zhuge Liang:
Liu Bei heard that his able friend
Must leave him, with saddened heart,
For each to the other had grown very dear,
Both wept when it came to part.
But the parting guest then mentioned a name
That echoed both loud and deep,
Like a thunder clap in a spring-time sky,
And there wakened a dragon from sleep.
Thus was Zhuge Liang recommended to Liu Bei, and Xu Shu rode away.
Now Liu Bei understood the speech of the hermit Water Mirror, and he woke as
one from a drunken sleep. At the head of his officers, he retook the road to
the city and having prepared rich gifts set out, with his brothers, for
Nanyang.
Under the influence of his emotions at parting, Xu Shu had mentioned the name
and betrayed the retreat of his friend. Now he thought of the possibility that
Zhuge Liang would be unwilling to play the part of helper in Liu Beiâs
scheme, so Xu Shu determined to go to visit him. He therefore took his way to
Sleeping Dragon Ridge and dismounted at the cottage.
Asked why he had come, Xu Shu replied, âI wished to serve Liu Bei of Yuzhou,
but my mother has been imprisoned by Cao Cao, and has sent to call me.
Therefore I have had to leave him. At the moment of parting I commended you to
him. You may expect him speedily and I hope, Sir, you will not refuse your aid
but will consent to use your great talents to help him.â
Zhuge Liang showed annoyance and said, âAnd so you have made me a victim of
the worldâs sacrifice.â
So saying, Zhuge Liang shook out his sleeves and left the room. The guest
shamefacedly retired, mounted his horse, and hastened on his way to the capital
to see his mother.
To help the lord he loved right well,
He summoned the aid of another
When he took the distant homeward way
At the call of a loving mother.
What was the sequel will appear in the following chapters.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 37 ****
As has been said Xu Shu hastened to the capital. When Cao Cao knew Xu Shu had
arrived, he sent two of his confidants, Xun Yu and Cheng Yu to receive the
newcomer at the city gate, and so Xu Shu was led first to the Prime
Ministerâs palace.
âWhy did such an illustrious scholar as you bow the knee to Liu Bei?â said
Cao Cao.
âI am young, and I fled to avoid the results of certain escapades. I spent
some time as a wanderer and so came to Xinye where I became good friends with
him. But my mother is here, and when I thought of all her affection, I could no
longer remain absent.â
âNow you will be able to take care of your mother at all times. And I may
have the privilege of receiving your instructions.â
Xu Shu then took his leave and hastened to his motherâs dwelling. Weeping
with emotion, he made his obeisance to her at the door of her room.
But she was greatly surprised to see him and said, âWhat have you come here
for?â
âI was at Xinye, in the service of Liu Bei of Yuzhou, when I received your
letter. I came immediately.â
His mother suddenly grew very angry.
Striking the table she cried, âYou shameful and degenerate son! For years you
have been a vagabond in spite of all my teaching. You are a student and know
the books. You must then know that loyalty and filial piety are often opposed.
Did you not recognize in Cao Cao a traitor, a man who flouts his king and
insults the mighty ones? Did you not see that Liu Bei was virtuous and upright
as all the world knows? Moreover, he is of the House of Han, and when you were
with him you were serving a fitting master. Now on the strength of a scrap of
forged writing, with no attempt at any inquiry, you have left the light and
plunged into darkness and earned a disgraceful reputation. Truly you are
stupid. How can I bear to look upon you? You have besmirched the fair fame of
your forefathers and are of no use in the world!â
The son remained bowed to the earth, not daring to lift his eyes while his
mother delivered this vilifying tirade. As she said the last word, she rose
suddenly and left the room. Soon after one of the servants came out to say Lady
Xun had hanged herself. Xu Shu rushed in to try to save her, but was too late.
A eulogy of her conduct has been written thus:
Wise Mother Xun, fair is your fame,
The storied page glows with your name,
From dutyâs path you never strayed,
The familyâs renown you made.
To train your son no pains you spared,
For your own body nothing cared.
You stand sublime, from us apart,
Through simple purity of heart.
Brave Liu Beiâs virtues you extolled,
You blamed Cao Cao, the basely bold.
Of blazing fire you felt no fear,
You blenched not when the sword came near,
But dreaded lest a willful son
Should dim the fame his fathers won.
Yes, Mother Xun was of one mold
With famous heroes of old,
Who never shrank from injury,
And even were content to die.
Fair meed of praise, while still alive,
Was yours, and ever will survive.
Hail! Mother Xun, your memory,
While time rolls on, shall never.
At sight of his mother dead, Xu Shu fell in a swoon and only recovered
consciousness after a long time. By and bye Cao Cao heard of it and sent
mourning gifts, and in due course went in person to condole and sacrifice. The
body was interred on the south of the capital, and the dead womanâs unhappy
son kept vigil at her tomb. He steadily rejected all gifts from Cao Cao.
At that time Cao Cao was contemplating an attack on the south.
His adviser Xun Yu dissuaded him, saying, âThe winter is not favorable for
this campaign. My lord should await milder weather.â
And Cao Cao yielded. But he began to prepare, and led the River Zhangâs
waters aside to form a lake, which he called the Aquamarine Lake, where he
could accustom his soldiers to fight on the water.
As has been said, Liu Bei prepared gifts to offer to Zhuge Liang on his visit.
One day his servants announced a stranger of extraordinary appearance, wearing
a lofty headdress and a wide belt.
âSurely this is he,â said Liu Bei, and, hastily arranging his dress, he
went to welcome the visitor.
But the first glance showed him that it was the recluse of the mountains, Sima
Hui. However, Liu Bei was glad to see him and led him into the inner apartment
as he would an old friend.
There Liu Bei conducted him to the seat of honor and made his obeisance,
saying, âSince leaving you that day in the mountains, I have been overwhelmed
with military preparations and so have failed to visit you as courtesy
demanded. Now that the brightness has descended upon me, I hope this
dereliction of duty may be pardoned.â
âI hear Xu Shu is here. I have come expressly to see him,â replied Water
Mirror bluntly.
âHe has lately left for Xuchang. A messenger came with a letter telling of
the imprisonment of his mother.â
âThen he has just fallen into Cao Caoâs trap, for that letter was a
forgery. I have known his mother to be a very noble woman. Even if she were
imprisoned by Cao Cao, she would not summon her son like that. Certainly the
letter was a forgery. If the son did not go, the mother would be safe; if he
went, she would be a dead woman.â
âBut how?â asked Liu Bei dismayed.
âShe is a woman of the highest principles, who would be greatly mortified at
the sight of her son under such conditions.â
Liu Bei said, âJust as your friend was leaving, he mentioned the name of a
certain Zhuge Liang. What think you of him?â
Water Mirror laughed, saying, âIf Xu Shu wanted to go, he was free to go. But
why did he want to provoke Zhuge Liang into coming out and showing compassion
for someone else?â
âWhy do you speak like that?â asked Liu Bei
He replied, âFive persons, Zhuge Liang of Nanyang, Cui Zhouping of Boling,
Shi Guangyuan of Yingchuan, Meng Gongwei of Runan, and Xu Shu of Yingchuan were
the closest of friends. They formed a little coterie devoted to meditation on
essential refinement. Only Zhuge Liang arrived at a perception of its meaning.
He used to sit among them with his arms about his knees muttering and then,
pointing to his companions, he would say, âYou, gentlemen, would become
governors and protectors if you were in official life.â
âWhen they asked him what was his ambition, he would only smile and always
compared himself with the great ancient scholars Guan Zhong and Yue Yi. No one
could gauge his talents.â
âHow comes it that Yingchuan produces so many able humans?â said Liu Bei.
âThat old astrologer, Yin Kui, used to say that the stars clustered thick
over the region, and so there were many wise people.â
Now Guan Yu was there. When he heard Zhuge Liang so highly praised, he said,
âGuan Zhong and Yue Yi are the two most famous leaders mentioned in the
Spring and Autumn and the Warring States Periods. They well overtopped the rest
of humankind. Is it not a little too much to say that Zhuge Liang compares with
these two?â
âIn my opinion he should not be compared with these two, but rather with two
others,â said Water Mirror.
âWho are these two?â asked Guan Yu.
âOne of them is Lu Wang, who laid the foundations of the Zhou Dynasty so
firmly that it lasted eight hundred years; and the other Zhang Liang, who made
the Han glorious for four centuries.â
Before the surprise called forth by this startling statement had subsided,
Water Mirror walked down the steps and took his leave. Liu Bei would have kept
him if he could, but he was obdurate.
As he stalked proudly away, he threw up his head and said, âThough Sleeping
Dragon has found his lord, he has not been born at the right time. It is a
pity!â
âWhat a wise hermit!â was Liu Beiâs comment.
Soon after the three brothers set out to find the abode of the wise man. When
they drew near the Sleeping Dragon Ridge, they saw a number of peasants in a
field hoeing up the weeds, and as they worked they sang:
âThe earth is a checkered board,
And the sky hangs over all,
Under it humans are contending,
Some rise, but a many fall.
For those who succeed this is well,
But for those who go under rough.
Thereâs a dozing dragon hard by,
But his sleep is not deep enough.â
Liu Bei and his brothers stopped to listen to the song and, calling up one of
the peasants, asked who made it.
âIt was made by Master Sleeping Dragon,â said the laborer.
âThen he lives hereabout. Where?â
âSouth of this hill there is a ridge called the Sleeping Dragon, and close by
is a sparse wood. In it stands a modest cottage. That is where Master Zhuge
Liang takes his repose.â
Liu Bei thanked him and the party rode on. Soon they came to the ridge, most
aptly named, for indeed it lay wrapped in an atmosphere of calm beauty.
A poet wrote of it thus:
Not far from Xiangyang
There stands, clear cut against the sky,
A lofty ridge, and at its foot
A gentle stream goes gliding by.
The contour, curving up and down,
Although by resting cloud itâs marred,
Arrests the eye; and here and there
The flank by waterfalls is scarred.
There, like a sleeping dragon coiled,
Or phoenix hid among thick pines,
You see, secure from prying eyes,
A cot, reed-built on rustic lines.
The rough-joined doors, pushed by the wind,
Swing idly open and disclose
The greatest genius of the world
Enjoying still his calm repose.
The air is full of woodland scents,
Around are hedgerows trim and green,
Close-growing intercrossed bamboos
Replace the painted doorway screen.
But look within and books you see
By every couch, near every chair;
And you may guess that common persons
Are very seldom welcomed there.
The hut seems far from human ken,
So far one might expect to find
Wild forest denizens there, trained
To serve in place of humankind.
Without a hoary crane might stand
As warden of the outer gate;
Within a long-armed gibbon come
To offer fruit upon a plate.
But enter; there refinement reigns;
Brocaded silk the lutes protect,
And burnished weapons on the walls
The green of pines outside reflect.
For he who dwells within that hut
Is talented beyond compare,
Although he lives the simple life
And harvest seems his only care.
He waits until the thunderous call
Shall bid him wake, nor sleep again;
Then will he forth and at his word
Peace over all the land shall reign.
Liu Bei soon arrived at the door of the retreat, dismounted, and knocked at the
rough door of the cottage. A youth appeared and asked what he wanted.
Liu Bei replied, âI am Liu Bei, General of the Han Dynasty, Lord of Yicheng,
Imperial Protector of Yuzhou, and Uncle of the Emperor. I am come to salute the
Master.â
âI cannot remember so many titles,â said the lad.
âThen simply say that Liu Bei has come to inquire after him.â
âThe Master left this morning early.â
âWhither has he gone?â
âHis movements are very uncertain. I do not know whither he has gone.â
âWhen will he return?â
âThat also is uncertain. Perhaps in three days, perhaps in ten.â
The disappointment was keen.
âLet us go back, since we cannot see him,â said Zhang Fei.
âWait a little time,â said Liu Bei.
âIt would be better to return,â said Guan Yu, âthen we might send to find
out when this man had come back.â
So Liu Bei agreed, first saying to the boy, âWhen the Master returns, tell
him that Liu Bei has been here.â
They rode away for some miles. Presently Liu Bei stopped and looked back at the
surroundings of the little cottage in the wood.
The mountains were picturesque rather than grand, the water clear rather than
profound, the plain was level rather than extensive, the woods luxuriant rather
than thick. Gibbons ranged through the trees, and cranes waded in the shallow
water. The pines and the bamboos vied with each other in verdure. It was a
scene to linger upon.
While Liu Bei stood regarding it, he saw a figure coming down a mountain path.
The manâs bearing was lofty. He was handsome and dignified. He wore a
comfortable-looking bonnet on his head, and a black robe hung about his figure
in easy folds. He used a staff to help him down the steep path.
âSurely that is he!â said Liu Bei.
He dismounted and walked over to greet the stranger, whom he saluted
deferentially, saying, âAre you not Master Sleeping Dragon, Sir?â
âWho are you, General?â said the stranger.
âI am Liu Bei.â
âI am not Zhuge Liang, but I am a friend of his. My name is Cui Zhouping.â
âLong have I known of you! I am very glad to see you,â replied Liu Bei.
âAnd now I pray you be seated just where we are, and let me receive your
instruction.â
The two men sat down in the wood on a stone, and the two brothers ranged
themselves by Liu Beiâs side.
Cui Zhouping began, saying, âGeneral, for what reason do you wish to see
Zhuge Liang?â
Liu Bei replied, âThe empire is in confusion, and troubles gather everywhere.
I want your friend to tell me how to restore order.â
âYou, Sir, wish to arrest the present disorder, although you are a kindly man
and, from the oldest antiquity, the correction of disorder has demanded stern
measures. On the day that Liu Bang first put his hand to the work and slew the
wicked ruler of Qin, order began to replace disorder. Good government began
with the Supreme Ancestor (BC 206), and endured two hundred years â-two
centuries of tranquillity. Then came Wang Mangâs rebellion, and disorder took
the place of order. Anon, arose Liu Xiu, who restored the Han Dynasty, and
order once more prevailed. We have had two centuries of order and tranquillity,
and the time of trouble and battles is due. The restoration of peace will take
time. It cannot be quickly accomplished. You, Sir, wish to get Zhuge Liang to
regulate times and seasons, to repair the cosmos, but I fear the task is indeed
difficult, and to attempt it would be a vain expenditure of mental energy. You
know well that he who goes with the favor of Heaven travels an easy road; he
who goes contrary meets difficulties. One cannot escape oneâs lot; one cannot
evade fate.â
âMaster,â replied Liu Bei, âyour insight is indeed deep, and your words
of wide meaning. But I am a scion of the House of Han and must help it. Dare I
talk of the inevitable and trust to fate?â
Cui Zhouping replied, âA simple denizen of the mountain wilds is unfitted to
discuss the affairs of empire. But you bade me speak and I have spoken â-
perhaps somewhat madly.â
âMaster, I am grateful for your instruction. But know you whither Zhuge Liang
has gone?â
âI also came to see him, and I know not where he is,â said Cui Zhouping.
âIf I asked you, Master, to accompany me to my poor bit of territory, would
you come?â
âI am too dilatory, too fond of leisure and ease, and no longer have any
ambitions. But I will see you another time.â
And with these words Cui Zhouping saluted and left. The three brothers also
mounted and started homeward.
Presently Zhang Fei said, âWe have not found Zhuge Liang, and we have had to
listen to the wild ravings of this so-called scholar. There is the whole result
of this journey.â
âHis words were those of a deep thinker,â replied Liu Bei.
Some days after the return to Xinye, Liu Bei sent to find out whether Zhuge
Liang had returned, and the messenger came back saying that he had. Wherefore
Liu Bei prepared for another visit.
Again Zhang Fei showed his irritation by remarking, âWhy must you go hunting
after this villager? Send and tell him to come.â
âSilence!â said Liu Bei, âThe Teacher Mencius said, âTo try to see the
sage without going his way is like barring a door you wish to enter.â Zhuge
Liang is the greatest sage of the day. How can I summon him?â
So Liu Bei rode away to make his visit, his two brothers with him as before. It
was winter and exceedingly cold. Floating clouds covered the whole sky. Before
they had gone far, a bitter wind began to blow in their faces, and the snow
began to fly. Soon the mountains were of jade and the trees of silver.
âIt is very cold and the earth is frozen hard, no fighting is possible
now,â said Zhang Fei. âYet we are going all this way to get advice which
will be useless to us. Where is the sense of it? Let us rather get back to
Xinye out of the cold.â
Liu Bei replied, âI am set upon proving my zeal to Zhuge Liang. But if you,
my brother, do not like the cold, you can return.â
âI do not fear death: Do you think I care for the cold? But I do care about
wasting my brotherâs energies,â said Zhang Fei.
âSay no more,â said Liu Bei, and they traveled on.
When they drew near the little wood, they heard singing in a roadside inn and
stopped to listen. This was the song:
Although possessed of talent rare,
This man has made no name;
Alas! The day is breaking late
That is to show his fame.
O friends you know the Lu Wangâs tale:
The aged man constrained to leave
His cottage by the sea,
To follow in a princeâs train
His counselor to be.
Eight hundred feudal chieftains met
Who came with one accord;
The happy omen, that white fish,
That leapt the boat aboard;
The gory field in distant wilds.
Whence flowed a crimson tide,
And him acknowledged chief in war
Whose virtues none denied;
That Zhang Liang, a Gaoyang rustic,
Fond of wine, who left, his native place
And went to serve so faithfully
The man of handsome face;
And one who spoke of ruling chiefs
In tones so bold and free,
But sitting at the festive board
Was full of courtesy;
And one, that was he who laid in dust
Walled cities near four score
But humans of doughty deeds like these
On earth are seen no more.
Now had these humans not found their lord
Would they be known to fame?
Yet having found, they served him well
And so achieved a name.
The song ended, the singerâs companion tapping the table sang:
We had a famous founder,
Who drew his shining sword,
Cleansed all the land within the seas
And made himself its lord.
In time his son succeeded him,
And so from son to son
The lordship passed, held firm until
Four hundred years had run.
Then dawned a day of weaklier sons,
The fiery virtue failed,
Then ministers betrayed their trust,
Court intrigues vile prevailed.
The omens came; a serpent
Coiled on the dragon throne,
While in the hall of audience
Unholy haloes shone.
Now bandits swarm in all the land
And noble strives with chief,
The common people, sore perplexed,
Can nowhere find relief.
Letâs drown our sorrows in the cup,
Be happy while we may,
Let those who wish run after fame
That is to last for aye.
The two men laughed loud and clapped their hands as the second singer ceased.
Liu Bei thought full surely the longed for sage was there, so he dismounted and
entered the inn. He saw the two merry-makers sitting opposite each other at a
table. One was pale with a long beard; the other had a strikingly refined face.
Liu Bei saluted them and said, âWhich of you is Master Sleeping Dragon?â
âWho are you, Sir?â asked the long-bearded one. âWhat business have you
with Sleeping Dragon?â
âI am Liu Bei. I want to inquire of him on how to restore tranquillity to the
world.â
âWell, neither of us is your man, but we are friends of his. My name is Shi
Guangyuan and my friend here is Meng Gongwei.â
âI know you both by reputation,â said Liu Bei gladly. âI am indeed
fortunate to meet you in this haphazard way. Will you not come to Sleeping
Dragonâs retreat and talk for a time? I have horses here for you.â
âWe idle folks of the wilds know nothing of tranquilizing states. Please do
not trouble to ask. Pray mount again and continue searching Sleeping Dragon.â
So he remounted and went his way. He reached the little cottage, dismounted,
and tapped at the door. The same lad answered his knock, and he asked whether
the Master had returned.
âHe is in his room reading,â said the boy.
Joyful indeed was Liu Bei as he followed the lad in. In front of the middle
door he saw written this pair of scrolls:
By purity inspire the inclination;
By repose affect the distant.
As Liu Bei was looking at this couplet, he heard someone singing in a subdued
voice and stopped by the door to peep in. He saw a young man close to a
charcoal brazier, hugging his knees while he sang:
âThe phoenix dies high, O!
And only will perch on a magnolia tree.
The scholar is hidden, O!
Till his lord appear he can patient be.
He tills his fields, O!
He is well-content and loves his home,
He awaits his day, O!
His books and his lute to leave and roam.
As the song ended Liu Bei advanced and saluted, saying, âMaster, long have I
yearned for you, but have found it impossible to salute you. Lately Water
Mirror spoke of you and I hastened to your dwelling, only to come away
disappointed. This time I have braved the elements and come again and my reward
is here. I see your face, and I am indeed fortunate.â
The young man hastily returned the salute and said, âGeneral, you must be
that Liu Bei of Yuzhou who wishes to see my brother.â
âThen, Master, you are not Sleeping Dragon!â said Liu Bei, starting back.
âI am his younger brother, Zhuge Jun. He has another elder brother, Zhuge
Jin, now with Sun Quan in the South Land as a counselor. Zhuge Liang is the
second of our family.â
âIs your brother at home?â
âOnly yesterday he arranged to go a jaunt with Cui Zhouping.â
âWhither have they gone?â
âWho can say? They may take a boat and sail away among the lakes, or go to
gossip with the priests in some remote mountain temple, or wander off to visit
a friend in some far away village, or be sitting in some cave with a lute or a
chessboard. Their goings and comings are uncertain and nobody can guess at
them.â
âWhat very poor luck have I! Twice have I failed to meet the great sage.â
âPray sit a few moments, and let me offer you some tea.â
âBrother, since the master is not here, I pray you remount and go,â said
Zhang Fei.
âSince I am here, why not a little talk before we go home again?â said Liu
Bei.
Then turning to his host he continued, âCan you tell me if your worthy
brother is skilled in strategy and studies works on war?â
âI do not know.â
Grumbled Zhang Fei, âThe wind and snow are getting worse. We ought to go
back.â
Liu Bei turned on him angrily and told him to stop.
Zhuge Jun said, âSince my brother is absent, I will not presume to detain you
longer. I will return your call soon.â
âPlease do not take that trouble. In a few days I will come again. But if I
could borrow paper and ink, I would leave a note to show your worthy brother
that I am zealous and earnest.â
Zhuge Jun produced the âfour treasuresâ of the scholar, and Liu Bei,
thawing out the frozen brush between his lips, spread the sheet of delicate
note-paper and wrote:
âLiu Bei has long admired your fame. He has visited your dwelling twice, but
to his great regret he has gone empty away. He humbly remembers that he is a
distant relative of the Emperor, that he has undeservedly enjoyed fame and
rank. When he sees the proper government wrested aside and replaced by
pretense, the foundation of the state crumbling away, hordes of braves creating
confusion in the country, and an evil cabal behaving unseemly toward the
rightful Prince, then his heart and gall are torn to shreds. Though he has a
real desire to assist, yet is he deficient in the needful skill. Wherefore he
turns to the Master, trusting in his kindness, graciousness, loyalty, and
righteousness. Would the Master but use his talent, equal to that of Lu Wang,
and perform great deeds like Zhang Liang, then would the empire be happy and
the Throne would be secure.
âThis is written to tell you that, after purification of mind with fasting
and of body with fragrant baths, Liu Bei will come again to prostrate himself
in your honored presence and receive enlightenmentâ
The letter written and given to Zhuge Jun, Liu Bei took his leave, exceedingly
disappointed at this second failure.
As he was mounting, he saw the serving lad waving his hand outside the hedge
and heard him call out, âThe old Master is coming!â
Liu Bei looked and then saw a figure seated on a donkey leisurely jogging along
over a bridge.
The rider of the donkey wore a cap with long flaps down to his shoulders, and
his body was wrapped in a fox fur robe. A youth followed him bearing a jar of
wine. As he came through the snow he hummed a song:
âThis is eve, the sky is overcast,
The north wind comes with icy blast,
Light snowflakes whirl down until
A white pall covers dale and hill.
Perhaps above the topmost sky
White dragons strive for mastery,
The armor scales from their forms riven
Are scattered over the world wind-driven.
Amid the storm there jogs along
A simple wight who croons a song.
âO poor plum trees, the gale doth tear
Your blossoms off and leave you bare.ââ
âHere at last is Sleeping Dragon,â thought Liu Bei, hastily slipping out of
the saddle.
He saluted the donkey rider as he neared and said, âMaster, it is hard to
make way against this cold wind. I and my companions have been waiting long.â
The rider got off his donkey and returned the bow, while Zhuge Jun from behind
said, âThis is not my brother. It is his father-in-law Huang Chenyan.â
Liu Bei said, âI chanced to hear the song you were singing. It is very
beautiful.â
Huang Chenyan replied, âIt is a little poem I read in my son in-lawâs
house, and I recalled it as I crossed the bridge and saw the plum trees in the
hedge. And so it happened to catch your ear, Noble Sir.â
âHave you seen your son-in-law lately?â asked Liu Bei.
âThat is just what I have come to do now.â
At this Liu Bei bade him farewell and went on his way. The storm was very
grievous to bear, but worse than the storm was the grief in his heart as he
looked back at Sleeping Dragon Ridge.
One winterâs day through snow and wind
A prince rode forth the sage to find;
Alas! His journey was in vain,
And sadly turned he home again.
The stream stood still beneath the bridge
A sheet of ice draped rock and ridge,
His steed benumbed with biting cold
But crawled as he were stiff and old.
The snowflakes on the riderâs head
Were like pear-blossoms newly shed,
Or like the willow-catkins light
They brushed his cheek in headlong flight.
He stayed his steed, he looked around,
The snow lay thick on tree and mound,
The Sleeping Dragon Ridge lay white
A hill of silver, glistening bright.
After the return to Xinye, the time slipped away till spring was near. Then Liu
Bei cast lots to find the propitious day for another journey in search of Zhuge
Liang. The day being selected, he fasted for three days and then changed his
dress ready for the visit. His two brothers viewed the preparations with
disapproval and presently made up their minds to remonstrate.
The sage and the fighting generals never agree,
A warrior despises humility.
The next chapter will tell what they said.

**** Chapter 38 ****
Nothing discouraged by two unsuccessful visits to the retreat of the sage whose
advice he sought to secure, Liu Bei made preparations for a third visit.
His brothers disapproved, and Guan Yu said, âBrother, you have sought him
twice. Surely this is showing even too much deference. I do not believe in this
fame of his for learning. He is avoiding you and dare not submit to the test.
Why so obstinately hold this idea?â
âYou are wrong, my brother. In the Spring and Autumn Period Prince Huan of Qi
paid five visits to the Eastern Suburb before he got to see Guan Zhong. And my
desire to see Zhuge Liang is even greater than his.â
âI think you are mistaken,â said Zhang Fei. âHow can this villager be
such a marvel of wisdom? You should not go again and, if he will not come, I
will bring him with a hempen rope.â
âHave you forgotten the great King Wenâs visit to Lu Wang, the old man of
the River Wei? If King Wen could show such deference to a wise man, where am I
too deferential? If you will not go, your brother and I will go without you,â
said Liu Bei.
âIf you two go, how can I hang back?â said Zhang Fei.
âIf you go, then you must be polite.â
Zhang Fei said he would not forget himself, and the three set out. When they
were a quarter of mile from the little cottage, Liu Bei dismounted, deciding to
show his respect by approaching the house on foot. Very soon he met Zhuge Jun,
whom he saluted with great deference, inquiring whether his brother was at
home.
âHe returned last evening. You can see him today, General.â
As Zhuge Jun said this, he went off with some swagger.
âFortune favors me this time,â said Liu Bei. âI am going to see the
Master.â
âThat was a rude fellow,â said Zhang Fei. âIt would not have hurt him to
have conducted us to the house. Why did he go off like that?â
âEach one has his own affairs,â said Liu Bei. âWhat power have we over
him?â
Soon the three stood at the door, and they knocked. The serving lad came out
and asked their business.
Liu Bei said very deferentially, âI would trouble the servant of the genius,
gentle page, to inform the Master that Liu Bei wishes to pay his respects to
him.â
âMy master is at home, but he is asleep.â
âIn that case do not announce me.â
Liu Bei bade his two brothers wait at the door quietly, and he himself entered
with careful steps. There was the man he sought, lying asleep on the couch,
stretched on a simple mat. Liu Bei saluted him with joined hands at a
respectful distance.
The time passed and still the sleeper did not wake. The two brothers left
without, beginning to feel impatient, also came in, and Zhang Fei was annoyed
at seeing his revered elder brother respectfully standing by while another
slept.
âWhat an arrogant fellow is this Master?â said he. âThere is our brother
waiting, while he sleeps on perfectly carelessly. I will go to the back of the
place and let off a bomb and see if that will rouse him.â
âNo, no! You must do nothing of the kind,â whispered Guan Yu, and then Liu
Bei told them to go out again.
Just then Liu Bei noticed that the Master moved. He turned over as though about
to rise, but, instead, he faced the wall and again fell asleep. The serving lad
made as if he would rouse his master, but Liu Bei forbade him to be disturbed,
and Liu Bei waited yet another weary hour. Then Zhuge Liang woke up repeating
to himself the lines:
âCan any know what fate is his?
Yet have I felt throughout my life,
The day would come at last to quit
The calm retreat for toil and strife.â
As he finished, he turned to the lad, saying, âHave any of the usual people
come?â
âLiu Bei, the Uncle of the Emperor is here,â said the boy. âHe has been
waiting a long time.â
âWhy did you not tell me?â said he, rising from the couch. âI must
dress.â
Zhuge Liang rose and turned into a room behind to dress. In a short time he
reappeared, his clothing properly arranged, to receive his visitor.
Then Liu Bei saw coming toward him a young man of medium height with a refined
face. He wore a head-wrap and a long crane-white gown. He moved with much
dignity as though he was rather more than mortal.
Liu Bei bowed, saying, âI am one of the offshoots of the Han family, a simple
person from Zhuo. I have long known the Masterâs fame, which has indeed
thundered in my ear. Twice I have come to visit you, without success. Once I
left my name on your writing table. You may have my note.â
Zhuge Liang replied, âThis hermit is but a dilatory person by temperament. I
know I have to thank you for more than one vain visit, and I am ashamed to
think of them.â
These courteous remarks and the proper bows exchanged, the two men sat in their
relative positions as host and guest, and the serving lad brought tea.
Then Zhuge Liang said, âFrom your letter I know that you grieve for both
people and government. If I were not so young and if I possessed any talent, I
would venture to question you.â
Liu Bei replied, âSima Hui and Xu Shu have both spoken of you. Can it be that
their words were vain? I trust, O Master, that you will not despise my
worthlessness but will condescend to instruct me.â
âThe two men you speak of are very profound scholars. I am but a peasant, a
mere farmer, and who am I that I should talk of empire politics? Those two
misled you when they spoke of me. Why do you reject the beautiful jewel for a
worthless pebble?â
âBut your abilities are world embracing and marvelous. How can you be content
to allow time to pass while you idle away life in these secluded haunts? I
conjure you, O Master, to remember the inhabitants of the empire and remove my
crass ignorance by bestowing instruction upon me.â
âBut what is your ambition, General?â
Liu Bei moved his seat nearer to his host and said, âThe Hans are sinking:
Designing ministers steal away their authority. I am weak, yet I desire to
restore the state to its right mind. But my ignorance is too vast, my means are
too slender, and I know not where to turn. Only you, Master, can lighten my
darkness and preserve me from falling. How happy should I be if you would do
so!â
Zhuge Liang replied, âOne bold person after another has arisen in various
parts of the empire ever since the days of the rebel Dong Zhuo. Cao Cao was not
so powerful as Yuan Shao, but he overcame Yuan Shao by seizing the favorable
moment and using his soldiers properly. Now he is all-powerful: He rules an
immense army and, through his control of the court, the various feudal lords as
well. You cannot think of opposing him. Then the Suns have held their territory
in the South Land for three generations. Their position in that old state of Wu
may not appear too secure, but they have popularity to appeal to. You can gain
support but win no success there.
âThe Region of Jingzhou rests on the two Rivers Han and Mian to the north,
and their interests lie in all to the south of these rivers. On the east they
touch Wu, and on the west they extend to the ancient states of Ba and Shu. This
is the area in which decisive battles have to be won, and one must hold it in
order to be secure, and Heaven has virtually made it yours.
âThe Region of Yizhou in the west is an important place, fertile and
extensive, a country favored of Heaven and that through which the Founder of
Han obtained the empire. Its ruler Liu Zhang is ignorant and weak. The people
are noble and the country prosperous, but he does not know how to hold it all,
and all the able people of the region are yearning for an enlightened prince.
âAs you are a scion of the Family, well known throughout the land as trusty
and righteous, a whole-hearted hero, who greatly desires to win the support of
the wise, if you get possession of Yizhou and Jingzhou, if on the west you are
in harmony with the Rong Tribes, on the south win over the ancient states of Yi
and Viet, make an alliance with Sun Quan of Wu, and maintain good government,
you can await confidently the day when Heaven shall offer you the desired
opportunity. Then you may depute a worthy leader to go to the northeast while
you take command of an expedition to the northwest, and will you not find the
warmest welcome prepared for you by the people? This done, the completion of
the task will be easy. The Hans will be restored. And these are my counsels in
all these operations, if you will only undertake them.â
Zhuge Liang paused while he bade the lad bring out a map. As this was unrolled
Zhuge Liang went on, âThere you see the fifty-four counties of the west.
Should you wish to take the overlordship, you will yield the Heavenâs favor
to Cao Cao in the north, and you will relinquish the Earthâs advantage to Sun
Quan in the south. You, General, will hold the Humanâs heart and complete the
trinity. Jingzhou is to be taken first as a home, the River Lands next for the
foundation of domination. When you are firmly established, you can lay your
plans for the attainment of the whole empire.â
As Zhuge Liang ceased his harangue, Liu Bei left his place and saluted him,
saying, âYour words, O Master, render everything so clear that the clouds are
swept aside and I see the clear sky. But Jingzhou belongs to Liu Biao, my
kinsman, and Yizhou to another kinsman Liu Zhang. I could hardly take the lands
from them.â
âI have studied the stars and I know Liu Biao is not long for this world.
Further, Liu Zhang is not the sort of man to endure. Both places will certainly
fall to you.â
Liu Bei bowed his acknowledgments. And so, in one conversation, Zhuge Liang
proved that he, who had lived in complete retirement all his life, knew and
foresaw the tripod division into which the empire was to break. True, indeed,
is it that throughout all the ages no one has ever equaled his intelligence and
mastery of the situation.
Behold, when Liu Bei frets that he is weak,
Then Sleeping Dragon is not far to seek;
When he desires to know how things will hap,
The Master, smiling, shows him on the map.
âThough I be of small repute and scanty virtue,â said Liu Bei, âI hope, O
Master, you will not despise me for my worthlessness, but will leave this
retreat to help me. I will assuredly listen most reverently to your words.â
Zhuge Liang replied, âI have long been happy on my farm and am fond of my
leisure. I fear I cannot obey your command.â
Liu Bei wept. âIf you will not, O Master, what will become of the people?â
The tears rolled down unchecked upon the lapel and sleeves of Liu Beiâs robe.
This proved to Zhuge Liang the sincerity of his desire.
Hence, Zhuge Liang said, âGeneral, if you will accept me, I will render what
trifling service I can.â
Liu Bei was greatly delighted. He called in Guan Yu and Zhang Fei to make their
bow and brought out the gifts he had prepared. Zhuge Liang refused all the
gifts.
âThese are not gifts to engage your services, but mere proof of my regard,â
said Liu Bei.
Then the presents were accepted. They all remained that night at the farm. Next
day Zhuge Jun returned, and his brother said to him, âUncle Liu Bei has come
thrice to see me, and now I must go with him. Keep up the farm in my absence
and do not let the place go to ruin. As soon as my work is accomplished, I will
certainly return.â
Then, turning from his humble home,
He thought of peaceful days to come,
When he should take the homeward way
And never beyond the valley stray.
But duty kept him in the west,
And there he found his place of rest.
An old poem may be quoted here:
The Founder of Han seized his gleaming blade
And at Mangdang Hills the blood of the white snake flowed.
He conquered Qin, destroyed Chu, and entered Xianyang.
After two centuries of rule the line was near broken,
But Liu Xiu restored the glory at Capital Luoyang.
And his children occupied the throne
Till decay began in the days of Huan and Ling.
The Emperor Xian removed the capital to Xuchang,
And, within the four seas, all was confusion.
Bold spirits started up in fierce contention.
Cao Cao, seized the favorable moment
And the imperial authority passed into his hands.
While the Suns made to themselves
A glorious heritage at the Great River,
Solitary and poor, Liu Bei wandered from place to place,
Till he found a haven in Xinye.
Sorely distressed he was at the sorrows of the people,
But Sleeping Dragon conceived a noble ambition,
Within his breast were thoughts
Of great things to be accomplished by force of arms.
Then, because of the parting words of Xu Shu,
And by the thrice repeated visits to his retreat,
The great hero found and knew his mentor.
When the age of Zhuge Liang was but thrice nine years,
He turned from his books, put aside his lute,
And left the peaceful fields he had loved,
Under his guidance Jingzhou was taken
And the two Lands of the Rivers conquered.
He unrolled great schemes, as one all knowing,
In speech, he went to and fro in the world,
The sound of war drums rolled from his tongue,
The words from his heart stirred one to the utmost depths.
The dragon pranced, the tiger glared,
And peace was brought to the world.
Through all the ages his fame shall never decay.
After taking leave of Zhuge Jun, Liu Bei and his followers left for Xinye, with
Zhuge Liang as companion. When they took up their abode there, Zhuge Liang was
treated as a mentor, eating at the same table, sleeping on the same couch as
Liu Bei. They spent whole days conversing over the affairs of the empire.
Zhuge Liang said, âCao Cao is training his troops for naval service in
Aquamarine Lake, and hence certainly intends to invade the country south of the
Great River. We ought to send our spies to ascertain what Cao Cao and Sun Quan
are really doing.â
So spies were dispatched.
Now after Sun Quan succeeded to the heritage of his father and brother, he sent
far and wide to invite people of ability to aid him. He established lodging
places for them in Kuaiji in Wu, and directed Gu Yong and Zhang Hong to welcome
and entertain all those who came. And year by year they flocked in, one
recommending another. Among them were Kan Ze of Kuaiji, Yan Jun of Pengcheng,
Xue Yong of Beishan, Cheng Bing of Runan, Zhu Huan of Wujun, Lu Ji of the same
place, Zhang Wen of Wucheng, Luo Tong of Kuaiji, and Wu Can of Wushang. All
these scholars were treated with great deference.
Many able leaders came also. Among them were Lu Meng of Runan, Lu Xun of Wujun,
Xu Sheng of Langye, Pan Zhang of Dongjun, and Ding Feng of Lujiang. Thus Sun
Quan obtained the assistance of many people of ability both in peace and war
and all went well with him.
In the seventh year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 202), Cao Cao had broken the
power of Yuan Shao. Then he sent a messenger to the South Land ordering Sun
Quan to send his son to court to serve in the retinue of the Emperor. Sun Quan,
however, hesitated to comply with this request, and the matter was the subject
of much discussion. His mother, Lady Wu, sent for Zhou Yu and Zhang Zhao and
asked their advice.
Zhang Zhao said, âCao Cao wishes a son to be present at court as a hostage
whereby he has a hold upon us, as formerly was the case with all the feudal
chiefs. If we do not comply with this request, he will doubtless attack the
region. There is some peril.â
Zhou Yu said, âOur lord has succeeded to the heritage and has a large army of
veterans and ample supplies. He has able officers ready to do his bidding. So
why should he be compelled to send a hostage to any person? To send a hostage
is to be forced into joining Cao Cao, and to carry out his behests, whatever
they be. Then we shall be in his power. It would be better not to send, but
rather to wait patiently the course of events and prepare plans to attack.â
âThat is also my opinion,â said the Dowager.
So Sun Quan dismissed the messenger but did not send his son. Cao Cao resented
this and had since nourished schemes against the South Land. But their
realization had been delayed by the dangers on the north and, so far, no attack
had been made.
Late in the eighth year (AD 203), Sun Quan led his armies against Huang Zu and
fought on the Great River, where he was successful in several battles. One of
Sun Quanâs leaders, Ling Cao, led a fleet of light vessels up the river and
broke into Xiakou but was killed by an arrow of Gan Ning, a general of Huang
Zu. Ling Cao left a son, Ling Tong, fifteen years of age, who led another
expedition to recover his fatherâs corpse and was so far successful. After
that, as the war was inclined to go against him, Sun Quan returned again to his
own country.
Now Sun Quanâs younger brother, Sun Yi, was Governor of Dangyang. He was a
hard man and given to drink and, in his cups, very harsh to his people,
ordering the infliction of severe floggings. Two of his officers, Military
Inspector Gui Lan and Secretary Dai Yuan, bore their chief a grudge and sought
to assassinate him. They took into their confidence one Bian Hong, of the
escort, and the three plotted to kill their master at a great assembly of
officials at Dangyang amid the banquets.
Sun Yiâs wife, Lady Xu, was skilled in divination, and on the day of the
great banquet she cast a most inauspicious lot. Wherefore she besought her
husband to stay away from the assembly. But he was obstinate and went. The
faithless guardsman followed his master in the dusk when the gathering
dispersed, and stabbed him with a dagger.
The two prime movers at once seized Bian Hong and beheaded him in the market
place. Then they went to Sun Yiâs residence, which they plundered.
Gui Lan was taken with the beauty of the dead Governorâs wife and told her,
âI had avenged the death of your husband, and you must go with me.â
Lady Xu pleaded, saying, âIt is too soon after my husbandâs death to think
of remarriage. But as soon as the thirty-day mourning sacrifices are over, I
will be yours.â
She thus obtained a respite, which she utilized to send for two old generals of
her husband, Sun Gao and Fu Ying. They came and she tearfully told her tale.
âMy husband had great faith in you. Now Gui Lan and Dai Yuan have compassed
his death and have laid the crime on Bian Hong. They have plundered my house
and carried off my servants. Worse than this, Gui Lan insists that I shall be
his wife. To gain time I have pretended to favor this proposal, and I pray you
now send the news to my husbandâs brother and beg him to slay these two
miscreants and avenge this wrong. I will never forget your kindness in this
life or the next.â
And she bowed before them.
They wept also and said, âWe were much attached to our master; and now that
he has come to an untimely end, we must avenge him. Dare we not carry out your
behests?â
So they sent a trusty messenger to Sun Quan.
On the day of the sacrifices Lady Xu called in her two friends and hid them in
a secret chamber. Then the ceremonies were performed in the great hall. These
over, she put off her mourning garb, bathed and perfumed herself, and assumed
an expression of joy. She laughed and talked as usual, so that Gui Lan rejoiced
in his heart, thinking of the pleasure that was to be his.
When night came she sent a servant girl to call her suitor to the palace, where
she entertained him at supper. When he had well drunk, she suggested that they
should retire and led him to the chamber where her friends were waiting. He
followed without the least hesitation.
As soon as she entered the room, she called out, âWhere are you, Generals?â
Out rushed Sun Gao and Fu Ying, and the drunken Gui Lan, incapable of any
resistance, was dispatched with daggers.
Next Lady Xu invited Dai Yuan to a supper, and he was slain in similar fashion.
After that, she sent to the houses of her enemies and slew all therein. This
done, she resumed her mourning garb, and the heads of the two men were hung as
a sacrifice before the coffin of her husband.
Very soon her brother-in-law came with an army, and hearing the story of the
deeds of the two generals from the widow, gave them the ranks of Commandership
and put them over Dangyang. When Sun Quan left, he took the widow to his own
home so that she would be cared for. All those who heard of her brave conduct
were loud in praise of her virtue:
Full of resource and virtuous, few in the world are like her,
Guilefully wrought she and compassed the death of the lusty assassins,
Faithful servants are always ready to deal with rebellion,
None can ever excel that heroine famous in Wu.
The brigandage that had troubled the South Land had all been suppressed, and a
large fleet of seven thousand battleships was in the Great River ready for
service. Sun Quan appointed Zhou Yu to be the Supreme Admiral and Commander-in-
Chief over all military forces.
In the twelfth year (AD 207), the Dowager Wu, feeling her end approaching,
called to her the two advisers Zhou Yu and Zhang Zhao and spoke thus: âI came
of a family of the old Wu, but losing my parents in early life. My brother Wu
Jing and I went into the old Yue, and then I married into this family. I bore
my husband four sons, not without premonitions of the greatness to be theirs.
With my first, Sun Ce, I dreamed of the moon and with my second, Sun Quan, of
the sun, which omens were interpreted by the soothsayer as signs of their great
honor. Unhappy Sun Ce died young, but Sun Quan inherited, and it is he whom I
pray you both assist with one accord. Then may I die in peace.â
And to her son she said, âThese two you are to serve as they were your
teachers and treat them with all respect. My younger sister and I both were
wives to your father, and so she is also a mother to you, and you are to serve
her after I am gone as you now serve me. And you must treat your sister with
affection and find a handsome husband for her.â
Then she died and her son mourned for her that year.
The following year, they began to discuss an attack upon Huang Zu.
Zhang Zhao said, âThe armies should not move during the period of
mourning.â
However, Zhou Yu, more to the point, said, âVengeance should not be postponed
on that account. It could not wait upon times and seasons.â
Still Sun Quan halted between two opinions and would not decide.
Then came Commander Lu Meng who said to his master, âWhile I was at Dragon
Gorge, one leader of Huang Zu, Gan Ning from Lingjiang, offered to surrender. I
found out all about him. He is something of a scholar, is forceful, fond of
wandering about as a fighter-errant. He assembled a band of outlaws with whom
he roamed over the rivers and lakes, where he would terrorize everybody. He
wore a bell at his waist, and at the sound of this bell everyone fled and hid.
He fitted his boats with sails of Xichuan brocade, and people called him the
âPirate with Silken Sails.â
âThen he reformed. He and his band went to Liu Biao, but they left him when
they saw he would never accomplish anything, and now they would serve under
your banner, only that Huang Zu detains them at Xiakou. Formerly when you were
attacking Huang Zu, he owed the recovery of Xiakou to this same Gan Ning, whom
he treated without liberality. When Commander Su Fei recommended Gan Ning for
promotion, Huang Zu said, âHe is unsuited for any high position as, after
all, he is no more than a pirate.â
âSo Gan Ning became a disappointed and resentful man. Su Fei tried to win him
over to good humor and invited him to wine parties and said, âI have put your
name forward many times, but our chief says he has no place suitable for you.
However, time slips away and manâs life is not very long. One must make the
most of it. I will put you forward for the magistracy of Exian, whence you may
be able to advance.â
âSo Gan Ning got away from Xiakou and would have come to you then, but he
feared that he would not be welcomed, since he had assisted Huang Zu and killed
Ling Cao. I told him you were always ready to welcome able people and would
nourish no resentment for former deeds. After all, every person was bound to do
his best for his master. He would come with alacrity if he only felt sure of a
welcome. I pray you express your pleasure.â
This was good news for Sun Quan and he said, âWith his help, I could destroy
Huang Zu.â
Then Sun Quan bade Lu Meng bring Gan Ning to see him.
When the salutations were over, the chief said, âMy heart is entirely
captivated by your coming. I feel no resentment against you. I hope you will
have no doubts on that score, and I may as well tell you that I desire some
plan for the destruction of Huang Zu.â
Gan Ning replied, âThe dynasty is decadent and without influence. Cao Cao
will finally absorb the country down to the river unless he is opposed. Liu
Biao provides nothing against the future, and his sons are quite unfitted to
succeed him. You should lay your plans to oust him at once before Cao Cao
anticipates you. The first attack should be made on Huang Zu, who is getting
old and avaricious, so that everyone hates him. He is totally unprepared for a
fight and his army is undisciplined. He would fall at the first blow. If he
were gone, you would control the western passes and could conquer the lands of
Ba and Shu. And you would be securely established.â
âThe advice is most valuable,â said Sun Quan, and he made his preparations.
Zhou Yu was appointed Commander-in-Chief; Lu Meng was Van Leader; Dong Xi and
Gan Ning were Generals. Sun Quan himself would command the main army of one
hundred thousand troops.
The spies reported that to Huang Zu who, at the news of an expedition against
him, called his officers together to consult. He placed Su Fei in chief
command. He also appointed Chen Jiu and Deng Long as Van Leaders, and prepared
for general defense. He had two hundreds of warships under the command of Chen
Jiu and Deng Long. On these he placed strong bows and stiff crossbows to the
number of more than a thousand and secured the boats to heavy hawsers so that
they formed a barrier in the river.
At the approach of the southern fleet, the drums beat for the ships to attack.
Soon arrows and bolts flew thick, forcing back the invaders, who withdrew till
several miles of water lay between them and the defenders.
âWe must go forward,â said Gan Ning to Dong Xi.
So they chose a hundred light craft and put picked men on them, fifty to a
boat. Twenty were to row the boats and thirty to fight. These latter were
armored swordsmen. Careless of the enemyâs missiles these boats advanced, got
to the defendersâ fleet, and cut the hawsers of their ships so that they
drifted hither and thither in confusion. Gan Ning leaped upon one boat and
killed Deng Long. Chen Jiu left the fleet and set out for the shore. Lu Meng
dropped into a small boat and went among the larger ships setting them on fire.
When Chen Jiu had nearly reached the bank, Lu Meng reckless of death went after
him, got ahead, and struck him full in the breast so that he fell.
Before long Su Fei came along the bank with reinforcements, but it was too
late. The armies of the South Land had already landed, and there was no hope of
repelling them. Su Fei fled into the open country, but he was made prisoner.
Su Fei was taken to Sun Quan who ordered that he be put into a cage-cart and
kept till Huang Zu should be captured. Then he would execute the pair. And the
attack was pressed on. Day and night they wrought to capture Xiakou.
He sees his ships cut loose and burned,
By the Silk-sailed Pirate he once spurned.
For Huang Zuâs fate, see next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 39 ****
Now Sun Quan fought against Xiakou. When Huang Zu recognized that he was beaten
and could not maintain his position, he abandoned Jiangxia and took the road to
Jingzhou. Gan Ning, foreseeing this, had laid an ambush outside the east gate
of Jiangxia. Soon after the fugitive, with a small following, had burst out of
the gate, he found his road blocked.
From horseback, Huang Zu said, âI treated you well in the past. Why do you
now press me so hard?â
Gan Ning angrily shouted, âI did good service for you, and yet you treated me
as a pirate. Now what have you to say?â
There was nothing to be said, and Huang Zu turned his horse to escape. But Gan
Ning thrust aside his troops and himself rode in pursuit. Then he heard a
shouting in his rear and saw General Cheng Pu coming up. Fearing lest this
other pursuer should overpass him and score the success he desired for himself,
Gan Ning fitted an arrow to his bow and shot at the fugitive. Huang Zu was hit
and fell from his steed. Then Gan Ning cut off his head. After this, joining
himself to Cheng Pu, the two returned bearing the ghastly trophy to their lord.
Sun Quan ordered them to place it in a box to be taken back home and offered as
a sacrifice to the manes of his father.
Having rewarded the soldiers for the victory and promoted Gan Ning, Sun Quan
next discussed the advisability of sending a force to hold Jiangxia.
But his adviser, Zhang Zhao, said, âIt is impossible to try to hold one
distant city alone. It is better to return home and prepare for the expedition
that Liu Biao will surely send in revenge. We will meet and defeat his worn
army, push home the attack, and capture his whole region.â
Sun Quan saw the advice was wise, so he left Jiangxia and led his army home to
the South Land.
Now Su Fei was still confined, but he got someone to go to Gan Ning to beg him
to plead for mercy. Gan Ning had expected this although the prisoner had said
no word, and he was averse from leaving his friend and one-time protector to
perish.
âI should not have forgotten him even if he had said nothing,â said Gan
Ning.
When the army had returned, Sun Quan gave orders for Su Feiâs execution that
his head might be offered with that of Huang Zu.
Then Gan Ning went in to his lord and said, weeping, âLong ago, if it had not
been for Su Fei, my bones would have been rotting in some ditch and how then
could I have rendered service under your banner? Now he deserves death, but I
cannot forget his kindness to me, and I pray you take away the honors you have
bestowed on me as a set-off to his crime.â
Sun Quan replied, âSince he once showed kindness to you, I will pardon him
for your sake. But what can be done if he run away?â
âIf he be pardoned and escape death, he will be immeasurably grateful and
will not go away. If he should, then will I offer my life in exchange.â
So the condemned man escaped death, and only one head was offered in sacrifice.
After the sacrificial ceremonies, a great banquet was spread in honor of the
victories. As it was proceeding, suddenly one of the guests burst into loud
lamentations, drew his sword, and rushed upon Gan Ning. Gan Ning hastily rose
and defended himself with the chair on which he had been sitting. The host
looked at the assailant and saw it was Ling Tong, whose father Ling Cao had
fallen under an arrow shot by Gan Ning. The son was now burning to avenge his
fatherâs death.
Hastily leaving his place, Sun Quan checked the angry officer, saying, âIf he
slew your noble father, then remember each was fighting for his lord for whom
he was bound to exert himself to the utmost. But now that you both are under
one flag and are of one house, you may not recall an ancient injury. You must
regard my interests continually.â
Ling Tong beat his head upon the floor and cried, saying, âBut how can I not
avenge this? It is a blood feud, and we may not both live under the same
sky.â
The guests interfered, beseeching the man to forgo his revenge, and at last he
ceased from his murderous intention. But he sat glaring wrathfully at his
enemy.
So soon after Gan Ning was dispatched with five thousand troops and one hundred
warships to guard Xiakou, where he was beyond the reach of Ling Tongâs wrath.
Then Sun Quan promoted Ling Tong, and so he was somewhat appeased.
From about this time the South Land enlarged her fleets, and soldiers were sent
to various points to guard the river banks. The brother of the chieftain, Sun
Kuang, was placed in command at Wujun, and Sun Quan himself, with a large army,
camped at Chaisang.
Zhou Yu, Commander-in-Chief of the army and Supreme Admiral of the navy, was on
the Poyang Lake training the naval forces, and general preparations were made
for defense and attack.
By his spies, Liu Bei had tidings of the doings in the lower portion of the
Great River, and knew of the death of Huang Zu. So he consulted Zhuge Liang as
to his action. While they were discussing matters, there arrived a messenger
from Liu Biao, begging Liu Bei to go to see him.
Zhuge Liang advised him to go and said, âThis call is to consult you about
avenging Huang Zu. You must take me with you and let me act as the
circumstances direct. There are advantages to be got.â
Leaving Guan Yu in command at Xinye, Liu Bei set forth, taking Zhang Fei with
five hundred soldiers as his escort.
On the way he discussed the course of action with his adviser, who said,
âFirst you must thank Liu Biao for having saved you from the evil that Cai
Mao planned against you at Xiangyang. However, you must not undertake any
expedition against the South Land but say you must return to Xinye to put your
army in good order.â
With this admonition Liu Bei came to Jingzhou and was lodged in the guest-
house. Zhang Fei and the escort camped without the walls. In due course Liu Bei
and Zhuge Liang were received, and after the customary salutations, Liu Bei
apologized for his conduct at the banquet.
The host said, âWorthy brother, I know you were the victim of a vile plot;
and I should have put the prime mover to death for it, had there not been so
universal a prayer for mercy. However, I remitted that penalty. I hope you do
not consider that I was wrong.â
âCai Mao had little to do with it. I think it was due to his subordinates,â
replied Liu Bei.
Liu Biao said, âJiangxia is lost, as you know, and Huang Zu is dead. So I
have asked you to come that we might take measures of vengeance.â
âHuang Zu was harsh and cruel and never used his people in the proper way:
That was the real cause of his fall. But have you reflected what Cao Cao may do
on the north if we attack the south?â
âI am getting old and weak, and I am unable to manage affairs properly. Will
you aid me, brother? After I am gone you will have this region.â
âWhy do you say this, my brother? Think you that I am equal to such a
task?â
Here Zhuge Liang glanced at Liu Bei who continued, âBut give me a little time
to think it over.â
And at this point he took his leave.
When they had reached their lodging, Zhuge Liang said, âWhy did you decline
his offer of the region.â
âHe has always been most kind and courteous. I could not take advantage of
his weakness.â
âA perfectly kind and gracious lord,â sighed Zhuge Liang.
Soon after the son of the Imperial Protector, Liu Qi, was announced, and Liu
Bei received him and led him in.
The young man began to weep, saying, âMy mother cannot bear the sight of me.
My very life is in danger. Can you not save me, Uncle?â
âMy worthy nephew, this is a family affair. You should not come to me.â
Zhuge Liang who was present, smiled. Liu Bei turned to him to know what he
should do.
âThis is a family affair. I cannot touch it!â replied Zhuge Liang.
The young man soon left, and when Liu Bei was saying good-bye, he whispered,
âI will get Zhuge Liang to return your call, and you can do so and so. He
will advise you.â
Liu Qi thanked him and left. Next day when the call was to be returned, Liu Bei
pretended to be suffering from colic and made that an excuse to send Zhuge
Liang to return the call.
The adviser went, and when he had reached the palace, dismounted, and was led
in, Liu Qi conducted him into one of the inner rooms.
When the tea had been brought, Liu Qi said, âI am an object of my
stepmotherâs dislike. Can you advise me what to do?â
âAs a mere stranger guest, I can hardly have anything to do with your own
âbone and fleshâ matters. If I did, and the story got abroad, much harm
might ensue.â
With this he rose to take leave.
But Liu Qi was unwilling to say farewell, and he said, âYour glory has turned
in my direction. You cannot mean to go away so pointlessly.â
Liu Qi led his visitor into a private chamber and had refreshments brought.
While they ate and drank, Liu Qi repeated his first request: What was he to do
since his stepmother disliked him.
âIt is not the sort of thing I can advise in,â replied Zhuge Liang, as he
rose for the second time to take leave.
âMaster, if you will not reply, that is well. But why incontinently leave
me?â
So the adviser once more seated himself, and Liu Qi said, âThere is an
ancient writing I should like to show you.â
And he led his visitor to a small upper room.
âWhere is the writing?â said Zhuge Liang.
Instead of answering Liu Qi wept, saying, âMy stepmother cannot bear me. My
life is in danger. O Master, will you not say a word to save me?â
Zhuge Liang flushed and rose to go away. But he found the ladder by which they
had mounted had been removed.
Again Liu Qi besought some advice, saying, âMaster, you fear lest it may get
abroad! Is that why you are silent? Here we are between earth and sky, and what
you say will come out of your mouth directly into my ear. No other soul can
hear. Now can you tell me what to do?â
âSow not dissension among relatives,â said Zhuge Liang. âIs it possible
for me to make any plan for you?â
âThen is my life indeed in danger,â said the young man. âI will die at
your feet.â
So saying, Liu Qi pulled out a dagger and threatened to make an end of himself.
Zhuge Liang checked him, saying, âThere is a way.â
âI pray you tell me.â
âYou have heard of the old tale of the brothers Shen Sheng and Chong Er, have
you not? Shen Sheng stayed at home and died; his brother Chong Er went away and
lived in peace. Now that Huang Zu is gone and Jiangxia is weakly defended, why
do you not ask to be sent there to guard it? Then you would be out of the way
of harm.â
Liu Qi thanked him. Then he called to his people to restore the ladder, and he
escorted Zhuge Liang down to the level ground.
Zhuge Liang returned to Liu Bei and related the whole interview. The young man
soon acted on the advice given him, but his father would not at first consent
to let him go.
To settle his doubts Liu Biao sent for Liu Bei, who said, âJiangxia is
important, and your son is the most suitable man to defend it. You must let him
go. The southeast will be defended by your son. The northwest I will look
after.â
âI hear that Cao Cao has been training a naval force, and I am afraid he has
intentions against us. We must be on our guard.â
âI know all about it. You need feel no anxiety,â said Liu Bei.
He took leave of his relative and went home while Liu Qi received command of
three thousand soldiers and went to guard Jiangxia.
At this time Cao Cao suppressed the three highest officers of state and
exercised their functions himself as the Prime Minister. He appointed as his
general secretaries Mao Jie and Cui Yan, and as literary secretary Sima Yi.
Sima Yi of Henei was grandson of Sima Juan, Governor of Yingchuan; son of Sima
Fang, Governor of Jingzhao; and younger brother of Sima Lang, Secretary
General.
Cao Cao then called his officers to a council to discuss an expedition against
the south.
Xiahou Dun opened the debate, saying, âLiu Bei is drilling his army at Xinye,
and is a source of danger. He should be destroyed.â
Accordingly Xiahou Dun was appointed Commanding General, and four assistants
â-Yu Jin, Li Dian, Xiahou Lan, and Han Hao â-were given him. With these he
led one hundred thousand troops to Bowang, whence he could observe Xinye.
Xun Yu was opposed to this and said, âLiu Bei is a famous warrior, and he has
lately taken to himself as his Directing Instructor Zhuge Liang. Caution is
needed!â
Xiahou Dun replied, âLiu Bei is a mean rat! I will certainly take him
prisoner.â
âDo not despise him,â said Xu Shu. âRemember he has Zhuge Liang to help
him, and so he is like a tiger who has grown wings.â
Cao Cao said, âWho is this Zhuge Liang?â
âHe has taken a Daoist cognomen of Sleeping Dragon. He is a perfect genius,
god and devil combined, the greatest marvel of the age. Do not despise him.â
âHow does he stand as compared with you?â asked Cao Cao.
âThere is no comparison. I am a mere glow-worm spark; he is the glory of the
full moon,â replied Xu Shu.
âYou are mistaken,â replied Xiahou Dun. âThis Zhuge Liang of yours is of
no account. Who would fear him? If I do not take him and his master prisoners
in the first battle, then here is my head, a free gift to our lord, the Prime
Minister.â
âHasten to comfort me with news of victory,â said Cao Cao.
Xiahou Dun hastened to depart.
The advent of Zhuge Liang and the extravagant deference shown him did not
please Liu Beiâs sworn brothers who grumbled, saying, âHe is very young,
although he is clever and learned. Our brother really treats him too well. We
have not seen any evidence of his wonderful skill.â
Liu Bei replied, âYou do not know his worth. I have him as if the fish has
got into the water again. Pray do not discuss this matter further, my
brothers.â
They withdrew, silent but dissatisfied.
One day a man presented Liu Bei with a yakâs tail, and he at once was trying
to weave it into his cap as an ornament. Zhuge Liang came in and noticed it at
once.
âThen you have renounced all ambitions, my lord. You are just going to attend
to this sort of thing,â Zhuge Liang quietly remarked.
Liu Bei snatched off his cap and flung it away, saying, âI was only amusing
myself with the thing.â
âHow do you think you stand compared with Cao Cao?â asked Zhuge Liang.
âInferior.â
âYes. Your army is less than ten thousand, and the chances are ten thousand
to one that he will attack. How can we meet him?â
âI am greatly distressed about it, but I see no way.â
âYou might recruit, and I will train them. Then we might be able to oppose
him.â
So recruiting began and three thousand were enlisted. Zhuge Liang set about
drilling them diligently.
Soon they heard that Xiahou Dun was leading an army of one hundred thousand
troops against them.
When he heard it, Zhang Fei said to his brother, Guan Yu, âWe will get this
Zhuge Liang to go and fight them.â
Just at that moment they were summoned to their brother, who asked their
advice.
âWhy not send the âWater,â brother?â said Zhang Fei.
âFor method I rely on Zhuge Liang; but for action I put my faith in you, my
brothers. Are you going to fail me?â
They went out, and Zhuge Liang was called.
âI fear your brothers will not obey me,â said Zhuge Liang. âWherefore, if
I am to direct the campaign, you must give me a seal of office and a sword of
authority.â
So Liu Bei gave him both. Armed with these ensigns of power, Zhuge Liang
assembled the officers to receive their orders.
âWe will go just to see what he will do,â said Zhang Fei to Guan Yu.
In the assembly Zhuge Liang spoke, saying, âOn the left of Bowang are Yushan
Hills. On the right is Anlin Forest. There we will prepare an ambush. Guan Yu
will go to Yushan Hills with one thousand soldiers. He is to remain there
quiescent till the enemy has passed; but when he sees a flame in the south,
that will be the signal to attack. He will first burn their baggage train.
Zhang Fei will go to a valley behind Anlin Forest. When he sees the signal, he
is to go to the old stores depot at Bowang and burn that. Liu Feng and Guan
Ping will take five hundred soldiers each to the south, prepare combustibles
and be ready with them beyond Bowang Slope. The enemy will arrive about dusk,
and then the two generals can start the blare. Zhao Zilong, now recalled from
Fancheng, is to lead the attack, but he is to lose and not win. And our lord is
to command the reserve. See that each one obeys these orders and let there be
no mistakes.â
Then said Guan Yu, âAll of us are to go out to meet the enemy, but I have not
yet heard what you are going to do.â
âI will just be sitting here guarding the city.â
Zhang Fei burst into a laugh, âWe are to go out to bloody battle, and you are
to stay quietly at home quite comfortable.â
âHere is the sword and here the seal!â replied the strategist, displaying
the emblems of authority. âDisobedience of orders will be death.â
Liu Bei said, âDo you not understand that the plans elaborated in a little
chamber decide success over thousands of miles? Do not disobey the command, my
brothers.â
Zhang Fei went out smiling cynically.
Guan Yu remarked, âLet us await the result. If he fails, then we can look to
it.â
The brothers left. None of the officers understood anything of the general line
of strategy and, though they obeyed orders, they were not without doubts and
misgivings.
Zhuge Liang said to Liu Bei, âYou may now lead your soldiers to the hills and
camp till the enemy shall arrive tomorrow evening. Then you are to abandon the
camp and move away retreating till the signal is seen. Then you will advance
and attack with all force. Mi Zhu, Mi Fang, and I will guard the city.â
In the city Zhuge Liang prepared banquets to celebrate the victory and also
prepared the books to record exceptional services.
Liu Bei noted all these things, but his heart was also troubled not a little.
Cao Caoâs army of one hundred thousand troops in due course reached Bowang.
Then half of them, the veterans, were told off for the first attack, and the
remainder were to guard the baggage train and supplies. Thus they marched in
two divisions. The season was autumn and a chilly wind began to blow.
They pressed forward. Presently they saw a cloud of dust ahead of them, and
Xiahou Dun ordered the ranks to be reformed. He questioned the guides as to the
name of the place.
âThe place in front is Bowang Slope, and behind us is the River Luo,â was
the reply.
Then Xiahou Dun rode to the front to reconnoiter, leaving Yu Jin and Li Dian to
finish setting out the battle array.
Presently Xiahou Dun began to laugh and, when they asked the cause of this
merriment, he replied, âXu Shu praised Zhuge Liang to the very skies as
something more than human. But now that I see how he has placed his soldiers
and the stuff he has put into his vanguard, it seems to me that he is sending
dogs or sheep against tigers and leopards. I bragged a little when I said I
would take him prisoner, but I am going to make good my boast!â
Then he rode forward at full speed.
Zhao Zilong rode to meet him, and Xiahou Dun opened a volley of abuse, âYou
lot, followers of Liu Bei, are only like wraiths following devils!â
This angered Zhao Zilong and a combat began. In a little time Zhao Zilong
turned and retreated as if he was worsted. Xiahou Dun pressed after him and
kept up the chase for some three miles. Then Zhao Zilong suddenly turned again
and offered fight, but only to retreat after a few passes.
Seeing these tactics Han Hao, one of Xiahou Dunâs generals, rode up to his
chief and urged him to use caution, saying, âI fear he is trying to lead us
into an ambush.â
âWith such antagonists as these, I should not fear even Ten Ambushes!â
replied Xiahou Dun, pressing forward eagerly.
Just as he reached the slope, he heard the roar of a bomb and out came Liu Bei
to attack.
âHere is your ambush!â said Xiahou Dun, laughing. âI will get to Xinye
this evening before I have done.â
Xiahou Dun urged his soldiers forward, and his opponents retired in measure as
he advanced. As evening came on, thick clouds overcast the whole sky. The wind
increased but the leader still urged his troops after the retreating foe.
The two generals in the rear came to a narrow part of the road with reeds and
rushes thick all round them.
âThose who despise the enemy are beaten,â said Li Dian to Yu Jin. âAway
south there the roads are narrow, and streams and mountains make the country
difficult. The forests are dense, and if the enemy used fire we should be
lost.â
âYou are right,â replied Yu Jin. âI will get on and warn the Commanding
General. Perhaps he will stop. You can halt those who come up.â
Yu Jin rode forward shouting at the top of his voice, âHalt the train!â
Xiahou Dun saw him coming up and asked what the matter was.
Yu Jin said, âThe roads here are narrow and difficult. Around us are thick
forests. What if they use fire?â
Xiahou Dunâs ferocity had then somewhat abated, and he turned his steed
toward his main body.
Then there arose a shout behind him. A rushing noise came from in the reeds and
great tongues of flame shot up here and there. These spread and soon the fire
was in âthe four quarters and the eight sides,â and fanned by a strong
wind.
Xiahou Dunâs troops were thrown into confusion and trampled each other down.
Many perished. Zhao Zilong turned on them again to make a slaughter. Xiahou Dun
dashed through the fire and smoke to escape.
Now Li Dian saw that things were going very badly, so he turned to get back to
Bowang but fell upon a body of troops in the way, led by Guan Yu. He
desperately dashed into their midst and managed to get clear. Yu Jin saw the
supplies were being destroyed and there was nothing left to guard, so he
escaped along a bye-path. Two other generals, who came to try to save the
baggage train, met Zhang Fei; and Xiahou Lan was slain forthwith, but Han Hao
managed to flee. Next morning the countryside was strewn with corpses and
drenched with blood.
The armies met on Bowang Slope
And Zhuge Liang fought with fire;
A perfect strategist, he bent
All humans to his desire.
But poor Cao Cao, his enemy,
He trembled in his shoes
Before the man, whoâd never fought
But yet could armies use.
Xiahou Dun drew up the battered remains of his army and led them back to
Xuchang.
Zhuge Liang ordered his armies to collect.
As Guan Yu and Zhang Fei rode homeward, they confessed, saying, âZhuge Liang
is really a fine strategist!â
Before long they saw Mi Zhu and Mi Fang leading out a small body of soldiers.
Among them was a light carriage in which the Directing Instructor Zhuge Liang
was seating. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei dismounted and bowed before him. The
remaining bodies came in. The spoil was distributed among the soldiers and all
returned to Xinye, where the populace lined the roads to bid them welcome.
âWe owe our lives to the Prince!â they cried to Liu Bei.
Said Zhuge Liang, âXiahou Dun has been driven off, but Cao Cao will come with
a stronger force.â
âAnd what shall we do?â replied Liu Bei.
âMy plan is quite ready,â said Zhuge Liang.
Always battles, nowhere rest for horse or human;
Must rely on ruses, dodging where one can.
The plan prepared against Cao Cao will be unfolded in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 40 ****
âXinye is a small city and unfitted for our lengthy occupation. Liu Biao is
ill and failing fast, so this is the time to take his region as a base where we
may be safe against Cao Cao.â
âYou speak well, but Liu Biao has shown me great kindness, and I could not
bear to serve him an ill turn.â
âIf you do not take this opportunity, you will regret it ever after,â said
Zhuge Liang.
âI would rather perish than do what is wrong.â
âWe will discuss it again,â replied Zhuge Liang.
When Xiahou Dun reached the capital, he presented himself to his master in
bonds and craved death. But his master loosed him and let him tell his tale.
And Xiahou Dun said, âI was the victim of Zhuge Liangâs evil machinations:
He attacked with fire.â
âAs a soldier from your youth, you should have remembered that fire was a
likely weapon in narrow roads.â
âLi Dian and Yu Jin reminded me. I am sorry enough now.â
Cao Cao rewarded Li Dian and Yu Jin who had warned their leader.
âLiu Bei as strong as he is now certainly is a menace to our existence, and
he must be quickly destroyed,â said Xiahou Dun.
âHe is one of my anxieties,â replied Cao Cao. âSun Quan is the other. The
rest do not count. We must take this chance to sweep the south clean.â
Then orders were issued to prepare an army of five hundred thousand troops, in
five divisions of ten legions each. Each division had two leaders: Cao Ren and
Cao Hong were in command of the first division; Zhang Liao and Zhang He, the
second; Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan, the third; Yu Jin and Li Dian, the fourth.
The fifth body was led by Cao Cao himself. The van was commanded by Xu Chu. The
âhorseâ day of the seventh moon of the thirteenth year of Rebuilt
Tranquillity was fixed for the march (AD 208).
The High Minister, Kong Rong, offered a remonstrance.
He said, âLiu Bei and Liu Biao are both of the Imperial House and should not
be attacked without grave reasons. Sun Quan in the six territories of the South
Land is terrible as a crouching tiger and, with the Great River as his defense,
he is very secure. If, Sir Prime Minister, you undertake this unjustifiable
expedition, you will forfeit the respect of the world, I fear.â
âAll three of them are disobedient ministers and rebels, and how can I fail
to punish them?â replied Cao Cao.
Cao Cao was angry, and bade the adviser go from his presence. Presently Cao Cao
gave formal orders that he would put to death anyone who remonstrated on the
subject of his expedition.
Kong Rong went forth from the Palace sadly.
Casting his eyes up to heaven, he cried, âWhere is the chance of success when
the perfectly inhumane attacks the perfectly humane? He must be defeated!â
One of the clients of the Imperial Inspector Chi Lu, whom Kong Rong had always
treated contemptuously and disdainfully, happened to hear this apostrophe and
told his patron who carried the tale to Cao Cao.
Chi Lu also added to it, saying, âKong Rong habitually speaks disrespectfully
of the Chief Minister and has been very friendly with Mi Heng. In fact the
insults that Mi Heng had hurled at you had been deliberately arranged and
intrigued by Kong Rong. Kong Rong and Mi Heng seemed to admire each other
hugely, and Mi Heng used to say, âConfucius is not dead, because Kong Rong is
he,â and the other used to reply, âAnd his treasured disciple, Yan Hui, has
risen again, because Mi Heng is he.ââ
Chi Luâs tale angered Cao Cao, who ordered the execution of the high
minister.
Now Kong Rong had two sons, both young, who were sitting at home playing chess,
when one of their servants ran in and said, âYour father has just been
carried off for execution. Why do you not run away?â
The youths replied, âWhen the nest is pulled down, are the eggs left
unbroken?â
Even at that moment the same executors came and carried off the whole
household. The two youths were beheaded. The fatherâs corpse was exposed in
the streets.
Minister Zhi Xi wept over the corpse. This public exhibition of sympathy
rekindled Cao Caoâs anger, and he was going to punish it with death.
However, this additional punishment was prevented by Adviser Xun Yu, who said,
âYou should not slay a righteous man who came to mourn over his friendâs
corpse. Zhi Xi had often warned Kong Rong against the danger his severe
rectitude might lead him into.â
Zhi Xi took up the remains of father and sons and buried them.
Kong Rong, who dwelt on the north sea shore,
A noble reputation bore;
With him all guests warm welcome found,
And ceaselessly the wine went round.
For skill in letters he was famed,
In speech, he dukes and princes shamed,
Historians his merits tell,
Recorders say that he did well.
After wreaking his wrath on Kong Rong, Cao Cao issued the order to march. Xun
Yu was left in command of the capital.
About this time the Imperial Protector of Jingzhou became seriously ill, and he
summoned Liu Bei to his chamber. Liu Bei went accompanied by his two brothers,
Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, and Directing Instructor Zhuge Liang.
Liu Biao said, âThe disease has attacked my very vitals, and my time is
short. I confide my orphans to your guardianship. My sons are unfit to succeed
to my place, and I pray you, my brother, administer the region after my
death.â
Liu Bei wept, saying, âI will do my utmost to help my nephews. What else
could I do, indeed?â
Even at this moment came the news of the march of Cao Caoâs armies, and Liu
Bei, taking hasty leave of his kinsman, was forced to hurry to his station. The
evil tidings aggravated the sick manâs condition, and he began to make his
last arrangements. In his testament he appointed Liu Bei the guardian of his
son Liu Qi, who was to succeed in the lordship.
This arrangement greatly angered his wife, Lady Cai. She closed the inner doors
against all and confided to her own partisans, of whom Cai Mao and Zhang Yun
were her confidants, the keeping of the outer gates.
The heir was at Jiangxia, and he came to make filial inquiries as soon as his
fatherâs condition became serious.
But Cai Mao refused him admittance and said, âYour father sent you to guard
Jiangxia. Such a very responsible post should by no means have been quitted
without orders. Suppose it was attacked, what might not happen? If your father
sees you, he will be very angry, and it will make him worse. That would be most
undutiful, and you should return to your command at once.â
Liu Qi stood out for some time, but admittance was denied him in spite of his
tears. So he returned to his post. Meanwhile Liu Biao rapidly grew worse. He
anxiously looked for his son, but Liu Qi came not. Suddenly Liu Biao uttered
piercing shrieks and then passed away.
When the Yuans were lords of the north,
And Liu Biao held the bank of the river,
It seemed, so strong were they both,
That they would endure forever.
But the family affairs troubled their states,
And, meddling, confusion made;
It was mournful indeed to see
How quickly the houses decayed.
So Imperial Protector Liu Biao died. Then the widow and her partisans took
counsel together and forged a testament conferring the lordship of Jingzhou on
the second son Liu Zong before they published the news of the death.
The wrongful heir was then fourteen years of age. But he was a cunning boy, so
he assembled the officials and said, âMy father has passed away, and my elder
brother is at Jiangxia. More than that, our uncle is at Xinye. You have made me
lord, but if my brother and uncle come here with an army to punish me for
usurping the lordship, what explanation can I offer?â
At first no one replied.
Then Adviser Li Gui rose and said, âYou speak well. Now hasten to send
letters of mourning to your brother and ask him to come and take his
inheritance. Also call upon Liu Bei to come and assist in the administration.
Then shall we be safe against our enemies â-Cao Cao on the north and Sun Quan
on the south. I consider this the most excellent plan.â
But Cai Mao replied harshly, âWho are you to speak thus wildly and oppose the
testament of our late lord?â
Li Gui began to abuse him, saying, âYou and your party have fabricated this
testament, setting aside the rightful heir. Now the whole region is in the
hands of the Cai family. If our dead lord knew your doings, he would slay
you!â
Cai Mao ordered the lictors to take Li Gui away to execution. He was hurried
out, but his tongue ceased not.
So the younger son was placed in his fatherâs seat, and the Cai clan shared
among them the whole military authority of the region. The defense of Jingzhou
was confided to Liu Xin and Deng Yi, while Lady Cai and her son took up their
residence in Xiangyang so as to be out of the reach of the rightful heir and
his uncle. They interred the remains of the late Imperial Protector on the east
of Xiangyang, near the bank of the Han River. No notice of the death was sent
to Liu Qi, the son, or to Liu Bei, his uncle.
Liu Zong arrived at Xiangyang, but, before he had had time to recover from the
fatigue of the journey, the startling news of the approach of Cao Caoâs great
army came in. He summoned Kuai Yue and Cai Mao and others to ask counsel.
One of the secretaries, Fu Xuan, offered his advice, saying, âNot only are we
threatened by a great army from the north, but the elder son, who is the real
heir, at Jiangxia, and his uncle at Xinye, are to be reckoned with. These two
have not been notified of the death, and they will resent that. We shall be in
sad case if they also march against us. But if you will adopt my suggestion,
then our people will be as steady as Taishan Mountains and our young lordâs
position and rank will be assured.â
âWhat is your plan?â asked the young lord.
âTo offer the whole region to Cao Cao, who will treat our young master most
liberally.â
âWhat advice!â said Liu Zong angrily. âAm I to yield my heritage to
another before I have even fairly succeeded to it?â
âThe advice is good,â said Kuai Yue. âOpportunism is a policy, and
possibilities need consideration. In the name of government, Cao Cao is
fighting against his neighbors. If our lord opposes him, he will be termed
contumacious. Beside, any misfortune on our borders before our young lord is
well established will react upon the internal administration, and our people
will be panic-stricken at the mere news of the approach of a hostile army. How
could we then offer any resistance?â
Liu Zong replied, âIt is not that I disagree with you, but I should be a
laughing stock to the whole world were I to abandon my heritage without an
effort.â
He was interrupted by a speaker who said, âIf their advice is good, why not
follow it?â
They turned toward the speaker who was a certain Wang Can of Shanyang, a lean,
cadaverous individual much below the middle height of a man.
However, his talents did not conform to his physical appearance. When he was
yet a youth, he went to visit Minister Cai Yong, then a vice-chairman of the
Secretariat; and although many guests of exalted rank were present, the host
hastened to welcome the newcomer with the greatest deference. The others were
astonished and asked why he was so respectful to a mere youth.
âHe is a young man with the highest gifts,â said Cai Yong.
Wang Can was widely read and had a most retentive memory, better than any of
his contemporaries. If he glanced at a roadside monument as he passed, he
remembered every word of the inscription. If he saw people playing chess and
the board was suddenly overthrown, he could replace every pip in its proper
place. He was a good mathematician and his poems were exquisite. At seventeen
he was appointed a court official but did not take up the appointment. When the
disturbance in the empire grew serious, he sought refuge in Jingzhou, where he
was received with great honor as guest of the Imperial Protector.
What he said was this, âGeneral, how do you compare with Cao Cao?â
âInferior,â replied Liu Zong.
Wang Can continued, âCao Cao has many soldiers and bold leaders. He is able
and resourceful. He took Lu Bu at Xiapi and broke the power of Yuan Shao at
Guandu. He pursued Liu Bei into Longyou and destroyed Mao Dun at White Wolf
Hills. The destruction of such firmly established men shows his invincible
character. Now he is on the way here, and it will be very difficult to
withstand him. The plan proposed is the best you can expect, and you should not
delay and hesitate till it is too late for ought but regret.â
âWorthy Sir, you indeed speak to the point. I must inform my mother,â said
the young ruler.
But just then they saw his mother appear from behind a screen. She had been
listening to all that was said.
âWhy refer to me when three such gentlemen coincide in their opinions?â
said Lady Cai.
So Liu Zong decided, and the letter of surrender was composed and entrusted to
one Song Zhong to convey secretly to Cao Cao. Song Zhong went straight to
Wancheng and presented the letter. It was received with joy, and the bearer
well rewarded.
The submission was accepted, and Cao Cao said, âTell Liu Zong to go out to
meet me in the open country, and he will be in perpetual tenure of his land.â
Song Zhong left the city and took the homeward way. He had nearly reached the
ferry when he fell in with a party of horse. On a closer look he saw the leader
was Guan Yu. The messenger tried to escape observation, but was presently
captured and taken to the leader to be questioned. At first he prevaricated but
on being closely questioned told the whole story. Then he was carried off to
Xinye and made to retell his story to Liu Bei who heard it with lamentations.
Zhang Fei said, âThis being so, I propose that we put this fellow to death,
then cross the river, attack Xiangyang, and make an end of the Cai tribe and
Liu Zong as well. Then we can attack Cao Cao.â
But Liu Bei replied, âHold on. I have something more to say.â
Then turning to the prisoner, Liu Bei shouted, âWhen they did all this, why
did you not come to tell me? As things are now, there is nothing to be gained
by killing you. You may go.â
Song Zhong stammered his thanks, threw his arms over his head, and ran away.
Liu Bei was very sad.
Presently Yi Ji from Jiangxia was announced. Liu Bei was very fond of this man
and went down the steps to welcome him.
Then said Yi Ji, âThe heir has heard that his father is dead, but his
stepmother and her family are keeping back the news so that they may set up Liu
Zong. He knows the news is true, as he sent a special messenger to find out. He
thinks you, O Prince, may not know and has sent me to inform you, and his
letter begs you to lead all the troops you can to Xiangyang to help him assert
his claims.â
Liu Bei opened and read the letter.
Then he said, âYes. You know that the younger son has usurped the lordship,
but you have not heard that he has already sent to offer Jingzhou to Cao
Cao.â
This news shocked Yi Ji, who asked, âHow know you this?â
Liu Bei told of the capture of Song Zhong.
Yi Ji said, âYou can go to Xiangyang as if to attend the mourning ceremonies
and so draw Liu Zong into coming out of the city to welcome you. Then you can
seize him, slay his party, and take the region.â
âYour advice is good,â said Zhuge Liang, âand my lord ought to take
it.â
Liu Bei wept, saying, âIn his last interview, my brother confided his son and
heir to my care. If I lay hands upon another son and seize upon the
inheritance, how shall I be able to look my brother in the face when I meet him
by and by beyond the grave?â
âIf you do not act in this way now, how will you repel Cao Cao, who has
already reached Wancheng?â said Zhuge Liang.
âOur best plan is to take refuge in Fancheng,â replied Liu Bei.
Just about this time the spies came to say that Cao Caoâs army had reached
Bowang. So Yi Ji was sent off with instructions to take measures for the
defense of Jiangxia, while Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang discussed plans for meeting
the enemy.
Zhuge Liang said, âMy lord should not worry. We have burned the army of Cao
Cao at Bowang Slope, so we will see them fallen into another ruse in Xinye.
This is no place to live in. We will move over to Fancheng.â
Then notices were posted at all the gates that all the people, without any
exception, were to follow their ruler at once to the new city to escape danger.
Boats were prepared and the people sent away under the direction of Sun Qian.
Mi Zhu saw to the safe conveyance of the families of the officials.
Then the officers assembled for orders.
Zhuge Liang gave directions, âGuan Yu is to go to the upper of the White
River with one thousand troops. His men are to carry bags to fill with sand and
earth to dam the river till the enemy shall be heard, about the third watch
next day. Then the waters are to be freed to drown one of the armies. He is
then to march down river.
âZhang Fei is to go to the Boling Ferry, where the current is slow. After the
waters of the White River have been let loose on Cao Caoâs soldiers, they
will try to get over the river at the ferry. They are to be attacked by Zhang
Fei and his one thousand troops.
âZhao Zilong is to divide three thousand troops into four parties and take
one to the east gate. The other three are for the other gates. The roofs of the
houses within the city walls are piled with sulfur, saltpeter, and other
combustibles. The intention is to set fire to the city when the army of the
enemy has entered it for shelter. There will be a strong breeze next day in the
evening which will fan the flames. When this wind begins to blow, fire arrows
are to be shot into the city from all sides. When the flames are high, there is
to be a great shouting outside to add to the general terror. The east gate is
to be left free for escape, but the flying men are to be smitten after passing
the gate.
âMi Fang and Liu Feng are to take command of two thousand troops, one half
with red flags and the other half with blue. They are to go to Magpie Tail
Slope, about ten miles from the city and camp. When they see Cao Caoâs army
coming along, the red flags are to move left and the blue right to confuse the
enemy so that they shall be afraid to advance further. Then an ambush is to be
laid to smite the enemy when the fire in Xinye starts. After that Mi Fang and
Liu Feng are to go to the river to meet us.
âAfter the battle, all generals shall gather at Fancheng.â
All the orders given, the various leaders went their way to take up their
positions and await the burning of the city. Zhuge Liang and Liu Bei went away
to an eminence whence they could watch what happened and where they would await
the reports of victory.
Cao Hong and Cao Ren, with their one hundred thousand troops, preceded by Xu
Chu leading three thousand of mailed men, marched toward Xinye. They formed a
mighty host and reached Magpie Tail Slope about noon. Looking ahead, they saw
what seemed a goodly army with many blue and red flags. Xu Chu pressed forward.
As he neared, the flags moved from side to side, and he hesitated.
He began to think, âIt could be an ambush. It is unwise to advance.â
Finally Xu Chu decided to go no farther and called a halt, and he rode back to
the main body to see Cao Ren.
âThose troops are only make-believe,â said Cao Ren. âAdvance, there is no
ambush. I will hasten up the supports.â
So Xu Chu rode to his own command again and advanced. When he reached the wood
where he had seen the flags, he saw no one at all. It was then late in the
afternoon but he decided to move on. Then he heard from the hills the sound of
musical instruments and, looking up, saw on the hill top two umbrellas
surrounded by many banners. There sat Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang quietly drinking.
Angry at their coolness, Xu Chu sought for a way up, but logs of wood and great
stones were thrown down, and he was driven back. Further, from the rear of the
hills came a confused roar. He could find no way to attack, and the sun began
to set.
Then Cao Ren and Cao Hong arrived and ordered an attack on Xinye that he might
have a place to rest in. They marched to the walls and found the gates wide
open. They entered and found a deserted city. No one was visible.
âThis shows they are done,â said Cao Hong. âThey have all run away,
people and all. We may as well occupy the city and rest our soldiers ready for
tomorrow.â
The soldiers were fatigued with marching and hungry as well, so they lost no
time in scattering among the houses and setting about preparing food in the
deserted kitchens. The leaders took up their quarters in the state residence to
rest.
After the first watch the wind began to blow. Soon after the gate guards
reported that a fire had started.
âThe careless men have let sparks fly about,â said Cao Ren.
He thought no more about it just then, but along came other reports of like
nature, and soon he realized that fires breaking out in all quarters were not
due to accident. So he gave orders to evacuate the city. Soon the whole city
seemed on fire, and a red glow hung in the sky. The army was beset with fire
fiercer than what Xiahou Dun had experienced at Bowang Slope.
Thrice wicked was Cao Cao, but he was bold;
Though all in the capital he controlled,
Yet with this he was not content,
So southward his ravaging army went.
But, the autumn wind aiding, the Spirit of Fire
Wrought to his army destruction dire.
Officers and troops dashing through the smoke and fire in utter confusion
sought some way of escape, and hearing that the east gate was free, they made
for that quarter. Out they rushed pell-mell, many being trodden down and
trampled to death. Those who got through took the road to the east.
But presently there was a shouting behind them, and Zhao Zilongâs company
came up and attacked. Then Cao Caoâs troops scattered, each fleeing for his
life. No stand was made. A little later Mi Fang and Liu Feng came to take
another toll. The fleeing Cao Ren then had very few followers, and those left
him were scorched and burned.
They directed their way to the White River, joyfully remembering that the river
was shallow and fordable. And they went down into the stream and drank their
fill, humans shouting and horses neighing.
Meantime Guan Yu, higher up its course, had dammed the river with sandbags so
that its waters were collected in a lake. Toward evening he had seen the red
glow of the burning city and began to look out for his signal. About the fourth
watch, he heard down stream the sounds of soldiers and horse and at once
ordered the breaking of the dam. The water rushed down in a torrent and
overwhelmed the men just then in the bed of the river. Many were swept away and
drowned. Those who escaped made their way to where the stream ran gently and
got away.
Presently Cao Ren and his troops reached the Boling Ferry. Here, where they
thought there would be safety, they found the road barred.
âYou Cao Cao brigands!â shouted Zhang Fei. âCome and receive your
fate!â
Within the city the red flame leaps out;
On the river bank burning anger is met.
What happened will appear in later chapters.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 41 ****
The last chapter closed with the attack made by Zhang Fei as soon as his
brother had let loose the waters on the doomed army. He met with Xu Chu and a
combat began, but a fight with such a warrior was not to Xu Chuâs taste and
he ran away. Zhang Fei followed till he came upon Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang, and
the three went upstream till they came to the boats that had been prepared by
Liu Feng and Mi Fang, when they all crossed over and marched toward Fancheng.
As soon as they disembarked, Zhuge Liang ordered the boats and rafts to be
burned.
Cao Ren gathered in the remnants of his army and camped at Xinye, while his
colleague Cao Hong went to tell their lord the evil tidings of defeat.
âHow dare he, this rustic Zhuge Liang!â exclaimed Cao Cao angrily.
Cao Cao then hastily sent an overwhelming army to camp near the place and gave
orders for enormous works against the city, leveling hills and turning rivers
to launch a violent assault on Fancheng from every side at once.
Then Liu Ye came in to see his lord and said, âSir, you are new to this
region, and you should win over the peopleâs hearts. Liu Bei has moved all
the people from Xinye to Fancheng. If we march through the country, the people
will be ground to powder. It would be well to call upon Liu Bei first to
surrender, which will prove to the people that you have a care for them. If he
yields, then we get Jingzhou without fighting.â
Cao Cao agreed and asked who would be a suitable messenger. Liu Ye suggested Xu
Shu.
âHe is a close friend of Liu Bei, and he is here with the army,â said Liu
Ye.
âBut he will not come back,â objected Cao Cao.
âIf he does not return, he will be a laughing stock to the whole world. He
will come back.â
Xu Shu was sent for, and Cao Cao said, âMy first intention was to level
Fancheng with the ground. But out of pity for its people, you may carry an
offer to Liu Bei that if he will surrender, he will not only not be punished
but he shall be given rank. But if he holds on his present misguided course,
the whole of his followers shall be destroyed. Now you are an honest man and so
I confide this mission to you, and I trust you will not disappoint me.â
Xu Shu said nothing but accepted his orders and went to the city, where he was
received by both Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang. They enjoyed a talk over old times
before Xu Shu mentioned the object of his mission.
Then he said, âCao Cao has sent me to invite you to surrender, thereby making
a bid for popularity. But you ought also to know that he intends to attack the
city from every point, that he is damming up the White Riverâs waters to be
sent against you, and I fear you will not be able to hold the city. You ought
to prepare.â
Liu Bei asked Xu Shu to remain with them, but Xu Shu said, âThat is
impossible, for all the world would ridicule me if I stayed. My old mother is
dead, and I never forget my resentment. My body may be over there, but I swear
never to form a plan for Cao Cao. You have the Sleeping Dragon to help you and
need have no anxiety about the ultimate achievement of your undertaking. But I
must go.â
And Xu Shu took his leave. Liu Bei felt he could not press his friend to stay.
Xu Shu returned to Cao Caoâs camp and reported that Liu Bei had no intention
of surrender. This angered Cao Cao who gave orders to begin the advance and
siege.
When Liu Bei asked what Zhuge Liang meant to do, Zhuge Liang replied, âWe
shall abandon Fancheng and take Xiangyang.â
âBut what of the people who have followed us? They cannot be abandoned.â
âYou can tell them to do as they wish. They may come if they like, or remain
here.â
They sent Guan Yu to prepare boats and told Sun Qian to proclaim to the people
that Cao Cao was coming, that the city could not be defended, and those who
wished to do so might cross the river with the army.
All the people cried, âWe will follow the Prince even if it be to death!â
They started at once, some lamenting, some weeping, the young helping the aged,
parents leading their children, the strong soldiers carrying the women. As the
crowds crossed the river, from both banks arose the sound of lamentation.
Liu Bei was much affected as he saw all this from the boat.
âWhy was I ever born,â said he, âto be the cause of all this misery to
the people?â
He made to leap into the river, but they held him back. All were deeply
sympathetic. When the boat reached the southern shore, he looked back at the
weeping crowds waiting still on the other bank and was again moved to tears. He
bade Guan Yu hasten the boats before he mounted and rode on.
When Xiangyang came in sight, they saw many flags flying on the walls and that
the moat was protected by barbed barriers.
Liu Bei checked his horse and called out, âLiu Zong, good nephew! I only wish
to save the people and nothing more. I pray you quickly open the gates.â
But Liu Zong was too frightened to appear. Cai Mao and Zhang Yun went up to one
of the fighting towers and ordered the soldiers to shoot arrows down on those
without the walls. The people gazed up at the towers and wept aloud.
Suddenly there appeared a general, with a small following, who cried out,
âCai Mao and Zhang Yun are two traitors. The princely Liu Bei is a most
upright man and has come here to preserve his people. Why do you repulse
him?â
All looked at this man. He was of eight-span height, with a face dark brown as
a ripe date. He was from Yiyang and named Wei Yan. At that moment he looked
very terrible, whirling his sword as if about to slice up the gate guards. They
lost no time in throwing open the gate and dropping the bridge.
âCome in, Uncle Liu Bei,â cried Wei Yan, âand bring your army to slay
these traitors!â
Zhang Fei plunged forward to take Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, but he was checked by
his brother, who said, âDo not frighten the people!â
Thus Wei Yan let in Liu Bei. As soon as he entered, he saw a general galloping
up with a few men.
The newcomer yelled, âWei Yan, you nobody! How dare you create trouble? Do
you not know me, General Wen Ping?â
Wei Yan turned angrily, set his spear, and galloped forward to attack the
general. The soldiers joined in the fray and the noise of battle rose to the
skies.
âI wanted to preserve the people, and I am only causing them injury,â cried
Liu Bei distressed. âI do not wish to enter the city.â
âJiangling is an important point. We will first take that as a place to dwell
in,â said Zhuge Liang.
âThat pleases me greatly,â said Liu Bei.
So they led the people thither and away from Xiangyang. Many of the inhabitants
of that city took advantage of the confusion to escape, and they also joined
themselves to Liu Bei.
Meanwhile, within the inhospitable city, Wei Yan and Wen Ping fought. The
battle continued for four or five watches, all through the middle of the day,
and nearly all the combatants fell. Then Wei Yan got away. As he could not find
Liu Bei, he rode off to Changsha and sought an asylum with Governor Han Xuan.
Liu Bei wandered away from the city of Xiangyang that had refused shelter.
Soldiers and people, his following numbered more than a hundred thousand. The
carts numbered scores of thousands, and the burden bearers were innumerable.
Their road led them past the tomb of Liu Biao, and Liu Bei turned aside to bow
at the grave.
He lamented, saying, âShameful is thy brother, lacking both in virtue and in
talents. I refused to bear the burden you wished to lay upon me, wherein I was
wrong. But the people committed no sin. I pray your glorious spirit descend and
rescue these people.â
His prayer was fraught with sorrow, and all those about him wept.
Just then a scout rode up with the news that Fancheng was already taken by Cao
Cao and that his army were preparing boats and rafts to cross the river.
The generals of Liu Bei said, âJiangling is a defensible shelter, but with
this crowd we can only advance very slowly, and when can we reach the city? If
Cao Cao pursue, we shall be in a parlous state. Our counsel is to leave the
people to their fate for a time and press on to Jiangling.â
But Liu Bei wept, saying, âThe success of every great enterprise depends upon
humanity. How can I abandon these people who have joined me?â
Those who heard him repeat this noble sentiment were greatly affected.
In time of stress his heart was tender toward the people,
And he wept as he went down into the ship,
Moving the hearts of soldiers to sympathy.
Even today, in the countryside,
Fathers and elders recall the Princely Oneâs kindness.
The progress of Liu Bei, with the crowd of people in his train, was very slow.
âThe pursuers will be upon us quickly,â said Zhuge Liang. âLet us send
Guan Yu to Jiangxia for succor. Liu Qi should be told to bring soldiers and
prepare boats for us at Jiangling.â
Liu Bei agreed to this and wrote a letter which he sent by the hands of Guan Yu
and Sun Qian and five hundred troops. Zhang Fei was put in command of the rear
guard. Zhao Zilong was told to guard Liu Beiâs family, while the others
ordered the march of the people.
They only traveled three or four miles daily and the halts were frequent.
Meanwhile Cao Cao was at Fancheng, whence he sent troops over the river toward
Xiangyang. He summoned Liu Zong, but Liu Zong was too afraid to answer the
call. No persuasion could get him to go.
Wang Wei said to him privately, âNow you can overcome Cao Cao if you are
wise. Since you have announced surrender and Liu Bei has gone away, Cao Cao
will relax his precautions, and you can catch him unawares. Send a well-
prepared but unexpected force to waylay him in some commanding position, and
the thing is done. If you were to take Cao Cao prisoner, your fame would run
throughout the empire, and the land would be yours for the taking. This is a
sort of opportunity that does not recur, and you should not miss it.â
The young man consulted Cai Mao, who called Wang Wei an evil counselor and
spoke to him harshly.
âYou are mad! You know nothing and understand nothing of destiny,â said Cai
Mao.
Wang Wei angrily retorted, saying, âCai Mao is the betrayer of the country,
and I wish I could eat him alive!â
The quarrel waxed deadly, and Cai Mao wanted to slay Wang Wei. But eventually
peace was restored by Kuai Yue.
Then Cai Mao and Zhang Yun went to Fancheng to see Cao Cao.
Cai Mao was by instinct specious and flattering, and when his host asked
concerning the resources of Jingzhou, he replied, âThere are fifty thousand
of horse, one hundred fifty thousand of foot, and eighty thousand of marines.
Most of the money and grain are at Jiangling. The rest is stored at various
places. There are ample supplies for a year.â
âHow many war vessels are there? Who is in command?â said Cao Cao.
âThe ships, of all sizes, number seven thousands, and we two are the
commanders.â
Upon this Cao Cao conferred upon Cai Mao the title of the Lord Who Controls the
South, and Supreme Admiral of the Naval Force; and Zhang Yun was his Vice-
Admiral with the title of the Lord Who Brings Obedience.
When they went to thank Cao Cao for these honors, he told them, saying, âI am
about to propose to the Throne that Liu Biaoâs son should be perpetual
Imperial Protector of Jingzhou in succession to his late father.â
With this promise for their young master and the honors for themselves, they
retired.
Then Xun You asked Cao Cao, âWhy these two evident self-seekers and
flatterers have been treated so generously?â
Cao Cao replied, âDo I not know all about them? Only in the north, where we
have been, we know very little of war by water, and these two men do. I want
their help for the present. When my end is achieved, I can do as I like with
them.â
Liu Zong was highly delighted when his two chief supporters returned with the
promise Cao Cao had given them. Soon after he gave up his seal and military
commission and proceeded to welcome Cao Cao, who received him very graciously.
Cao Cao next proceeded to camp near Xiangyang. The populace, led by Cai Mao and
Zhang Yun, welcomed him with burning incense, and he on his part put forth
proclamations couched in comforting terms.
Cao Cao presently entered the city and took his seat in the residence in state.
Then he summoned Kuai Yue and said to him graciously, âI do not rejoice so
much at gaining Jingzhou as at meeting you, friend Kuai Yue.â
Cao Cao made Kuai Yue Governor of Jiangling and Lord of Fancheng; Wang Can, Fu
Xuan, and Kuai Yueâs other adherents were all ennobled. Liu Zong became
Imperial Protector of Qingzhou in the north and was ordered to proceed to his
region forthwith.
Liu Zong was greatly frightened and said, âI have no wish to become an actual
official. I wish to remain in the place where my father and mother live.â
Said Cao Cao, âYour protectorship is quite near the capital, and I have sent
you there as a full official to remove you from the intrigues of this place.â
In vain Liu Zong declined the honors thus thrust upon him: He was compelled to
go and he departed, taking his mother with him. Of his friends, only Wang Wei
accompanied him. Some of his late officers escorted him as far as the river and
then took their leave.
Then Cao Cao called his trusty officer Yu Jin and said, âFollow Liu Zong and
put him and his mother to death. Our worries are thus removed.â
Yu Jin followed the small party.
When he drew near he shouted, âI have an order from the great Prime Minister
to put you both to death, mother and son! You may as well submit quietly.â
Lady Cai threw her arms about her son, lifted up her voice and wept. Yu Jin
bade his soldiers get on with their bloody work. Only Wang Wei made any attempt
to save his mistress, and he was soon killed. The two, mother and son, were
soon finished, and Yu Jin returned to report his success. He was richly
rewarded.
Next Cao Cao sent to discover and seize the family of Zhuge Liang, but they had
already disappeared. Zhuge Liang had moved them to the Three Gorges. It was
much to Cao Caoâs disgust that the search was fruitless.
So Xiangyang was settled. Then Xun You proposed a further advance.
He said, âJiangling is an important place, and very rich. If Liu Bei gets it,
it will be difficult to dislodge him.â
âHow could I have overlooked that?â said Cao Cao.
Then he called upon the officers of Xiangyang for one who could lead the way.
They all came except Wen Ping.
Cao Cao sent for him and soon he came also.
âWhy are you late?â asked Cao Cao.
Wen Ping said, âTo be a minister and see oneâs master lose his own
boundaries is most shameful. Such a person has no face to show to anyone else,
and I was too ashamed to come.â
His tears fell fast as he finished this speech. Cao Cao admired his loyal
conduct and rewarded him with office of Governorship of Jiangxia and a title of
Lordship, and also bade him open the way.
The spies returned and said, âLiu Bei is hampered by the crowds of people who
have followed him. He can proceed only three or four miles daily, and he is
only one hundred miles away.â
Cao Cao decided to take advantage of Liu Beiâs plight, so he chose out five
thousand of tried horsemen and sent them after the cavalcade, giving them a
limit of a day and a night to come up therewith. The main army would follow.
As has been said Liu Bei was traveling with a huge multitude of followers, to
guard whom he had taken what precautions were possible. Zhang Fei was in charge
of the rear guard, and Zhao Zilong was to protect his lordâs family. Guan Yu
had been sent to Jiangxia.
One day Zhuge Liang came in and said, âThere is as yet no news from Jiangxia.
There must be some difficulties.â
âI wish that you yourself would go there,â said Liu Bei. âLiu Qi would
remember your former kindness to him and consent to anything you proposed.â
Zhuge Liang said he would go and set out with Liu Feng, the adopted son of Liu
Bei, taking an escort of five hundred troops.
A few days after, while on the march in company with three of his commanders
â-Jian Yong, Mi Zhu, and Mi Fang â-a sudden whirlwind rose just in front of
Liu Bei, and a huge column of dust shot up into the air hiding the face of the
sun.
Liu Bei was frightened and asked, âWhat might that portend?â
Jian Yong, who knew something of the mysteries of nature, took the auspices by
counting secretly on his fingers.
Pale and trembling, he announced, âA calamity is threatening this very night.
My lord must leave the people to their fate and flee quickly.â
âI cannot do that,â said Liu Bei.
âIf you allow your pity to overcome your judgment, then misfortune is very
near,â said Jian Yong.
Thus spoke Jian Yong to his lord, who then asked what place was near.
His people replied, âDangyang is quite close, and there is a very famous
mountain near it called Prospect Mountain.â
Then Liu Bei bade them lead the way thither.
The season was late autumn, just changing to winter, and the icy wind
penetrated to the very bones. As evening fell, long-drawn howls of misery were
heard on every side. At the middle of the fourth watch, two hours after
midnight, they heard a rumbling sound in the northwest. Liu Bei halted and
placed himself at the head of his own guard of two thousand soldiers to meet
whatever might come.
Presently Cao Caoâs men appeared and made fierce onslaught. Defense was
impossible, though Liu Bei fought desperately. By good fortune just at the
crisis Zhang Fei came up, cut an alley through, rescued his brother, and got
him away to the east. Presently they were stopped by Wen Ping.
âTurncoat! Can you still look humans in the face?â cried Liu Bei.
Wen Ping was overwhelmed with shame and led his troops away. Zhang Fei, now
fighting, protected his brother till dawn.
By that time Liu Bei had got beyond the sound of battle, and there was time to
rest. Only a few of his followers had been able to keep near him. He knew
nothing of the fate of his officers or the people.
He lifted up his voice in lamentation, saying, âMyriads of living souls are
suffering from love of me, and my officers and my loved ones are lost. One
would be a graven image not to weep at such loss!â
Still plunged in sadness, presently he saw hurrying toward him Mi Fang, with an
enemyâs arrow still sticking in his face.
Mi Fang exclaimed, âZhao Zilong has gone over to Cao Cao!â
Liu Bei angrily bade him be silent, crying, âDo you think I can believe that
of my old friend?â
âPerhaps he has gone over,â said Zhang Fei. âHe must see that we are
nearly lost and there are riches and honors on the other side.â
âHe has followed me faithfully through all my misfortunes. His heart is firm
as a rock. No riches or honors would move him,â said Liu Bei.
âI saw him go away northwest,â said Mi Fang.
âWait till I meet him,â said Zhang Fei. âIf I run against him, I will
kill him!â
âBeware how you doubt him,â said Liu Bei. âHave you forgotten the
circumstances under which your brother Guan Yu had to slay Cai Yang to ease
your doubts of him? Zhao Zilongâs absence is due to good reason wherever he
has gone, and he would never abandon me.â
But Zhang Fei was not convinced. Then he, with a score of his men, rode to the
Long Slope Bridge. Seeing a wood near the bridge, an idea suddenly struck him.
He bade his followers cut branches from the trees, tie them to the tails of the
horses, and ride to and fro so as to raise a great dust as though an army were
concealed in the wood. He himself took up his station on the bridge facing the
west with spear set ready for action. So he kept watch.
Now Zhao Zilong, after fighting with the enemy from the fourth watch till
daylight, could see no sign of his lord and, moreover, had lost his lordâs
family.
He thought bitterly within himself, âMy master confided to me his family and
the child lord Liu Shan; and I have lost them. How can I look him in the face?
I can only go now and fight to the death. Whatever happen, I must go to seek
the women and my lordâs son.â
Turning about he found he had but some forty followers left. He rode quickly to
and fro among the scattered soldiers seeking the lost women. The lamentations
of the people about him were enough to make heaven and earth weep. Some had
been wounded by arrows, others by spears; they had thrown away their children,
abandoned their wives, and were flying they knew not whither in crowds.
Presently Zhao Zilong saw a man lying in the grass and recognized him as Jian
Yong.
âHave you seen the two mothers?â cried he.
Jian Yong replied, âThey left their carriage and ran away taking the child
lord Liu Shan in their arms. I followed but on the slope of the hill I was
wounded and fell from my horse. The horse was stolen. I could fight no longer,
and I lay down here.â
Zhao Zilong put his colleague on the horse of one of his followers, told off
two soldiers to support Jian Yong, and bade Jian Yong ride to their lord and
tell him of the loss.
âSay,â said Zhao Zilong, âthat I will seek the lost ones in heaven or
hell, through good or evil. And if I find them not, I will die in the
battlefield.â
Then Zhao Zilong rode off toward the Long Slope Bridge.
As he went, a voice called out, âGeneral Zhao Zilong, where are you going?â
âWho are you?â said Zhao Zilong, pulling up.
âOne of the Princely Oneâs carriage guards. I am wounded.â
âDo you know anything of the two ladies?â
âNot very long ago I saw Lady Gan go south with a party of other women. Her
hair was down, and she was barefootedâ
Hearing this, without even another glance at the speaker, Zhao Zilong put his
horse at full gallop toward the south. Soon he saw a small crowd of people,
male and female, walking hand in hand.
âIs Lady Gan among you!â he called out.
A woman in the rear of the party looked up at him and uttered a loud cry.
He slipped off his steed, stuck his spear in the sand, and wept, âIt was my
fault that you were lost. But where are Lady Mi and our child lord?â
Lady Gan replied, âShe and I were forced to abandon our carriage and mingle
with the crowd on foot. Then a band of soldiers came up, and we were separated.
I do not know where they are. I ran for my life.â
As she spoke, a howl of distress rose from the crowd of fugitives, for a
thousand of soldiers appeared. Zhao Zilong recovered his spear and mounted
ready for action. Presently he saw among the soldiers a prisoner bound upon a
horse, and the prisoner was Mi Zhu. Behind Mi Zhu followed a general gripping a
huge sword. The troops belonged to the army of Cao Ren, and the general was
Chunyu Dao. Having captured Mi Zhu, he was just taking him to his chief as a
proof of his prowess.
Zhao Zilong shouted and rode at the captor who was speedily slain by a spear
thrust and his captive was set free. Then taking two of the horses, Zhao Zilong
set Lady Gan on one and Mi Zhu took the other. They rode away toward Long Slope
Bridge.
But there, standing grim on the bridge, was Zhang Fei.
As soon as he saw Zhao Zilong, he called out, âZhao Zilong, why have you
betrayed our lord?â
âI fell behind because I was seeking the ladies and our child lord,â said
Zhao Zilong. âWhat do you mean by talking of betrayal?â
âIf it had not been that Jian Yong arrived before you and told me the story,
I should hardly have spared you.â
âWhere is the master?â said Zhao Zilong.
âNot far away, in front there,â said Zhang Fei.
âConduct Lady Gan to him. I am going to look for Lady Mi,â said Zhao Zilong
to his companion, and he turned back along the road by which he had come.
Before long he met a leader armed with an iron spear and carrying a sword slung
across his back, riding a curvetting steed, and leading ten other horsemen.
Without uttering a word Zhao Zilong rode straight toward him and engaged. At
the first pass Zhao Zilong disarmed his opponent and brought him to earth. His
followers galloped away.
This fallen officer was no other than Xiahou En, Cao Caoâs sword-bearer. And
the sword on Xiahou Enâs back was his masterâs . Cao Cao had two swords,
one called âTrust of Godâ and the other âBlue Bladeâ. Trust of God was
the weapon Cao Cao usually wore at his side, the other being carried by his
sword-bearer. The Blue Blade would cut clean through iron as though it were
mud, and no sword had so keen an edge.
Before Zhao Zilong thus fell in with Xiahou En, the latter was simply
plundering, depending upon the authority implied by his office. Least of all
thought he of such sudden death as met he at Zhao Zilongâs hands.
So Zhao Zilong got possession of a famous sword. The name Blue Blade was chased
in gold characters so that he recognized its value at once. He stuck it in his
belt and again plunged into the press. Just as he did so, he turned his head
and saw he had not a single follower left. He was quite alone.
Nevertheless not for a single instant thought he of turning back. He was too
intent upon his quest. To and fro, back and forth, he rode questioning this
person and that.
At length a man said, âA woman with a child in her arms, and wounded in the
thigh so that she cannot walk, is lying over there through that hole in the
wall.â
Zhao Zilong rode to look and there, beside an old well behind the broken wall
of a burned house, sat the mother clasping the child to her breast and weeping.
Zhao Zilong was on his knees before her in a moment.
âMy child will live then since you are here,â cried Lady Mi. âPity him, O
General! Protect him, for he is the only son of his fatherâs flesh and blood.
Take him to his father, and I can die content.â
âIt is my fault that you have suffered,â replied Zhao Zilong. âBut it is
useless to say more. I pray you take my horse, while I will walk beside and
protect you till we get clear.â
She replied, âI may not do that. What would you do without a steed? But the
boy here I confide to your care. I am badly wounded and cannot hope to live.
Pray take him and go your way. Do not trouble more about me.â
âI hear shouting,â said Zhao Zilong. âThe soldiers will be upon us again
in a moment. Pray mount quickly!â
âBut really I cannot move,â she said. âDo not let there be a double
loss!â
And she held out the child toward him as she spoke.
âTake the child!â cried Lady Mi. âHis life and safety are in your
hands.â
Again and again Zhao Zilong besought her to get on his horse, but she would
not.
The shouting drew nearer and nearer, Zhao Zilong spoke harshly, saying, âIf
you will not do what I say, what will happen when the soldiers come up?â
She said no more. Throwing the child on the ground, she turned over and threw
herself into the old well. And there she perished.
The warrior relies upon the strength of his charger,
Afoot, how could he bear to safety his young prince?
Brave mother! Who died to preserve the son of her husbandâs line;
Heroine was she, bold and decisive!
Seeing that Lady Mi had resolved the question by dying, there was nothing more
to be done. Zhao Zilong pushed over the wall to fill the well, and thus making
a grave for the lady. Then he loosened his armor, let down the heart-protecting
mirror, and placed the child in his breast. This done he slung his spear and
remounted.
Zhao Zilong had gone but a short distance, when he saw a horde of enemy led by
Yan Ming, one of Cao Hongâs generals. This warrior used a double edged, three
pointed weapon and he offered battle. However, Zhao Zilong disposed of him
after a very few bouts and dispersed his troops.
As the road cleared before him, Zhao Zilong saw another detachment barring his
way. At the head of this was a general exalted enough to display a banner with
his name Zhang He of Hejian. Zhao Zilong never waited to parley but attacked.
However, this was a more formidable antagonist, and half a score bouts found
neither any nearer defeat. But Zhao Zilong, with the child in his bosom, could
only fight with the greatest caution, and so he decided to flee.
Zhang He pursued, and as Zhao Zilong thought only of thrashing his steed to get
away, and little of the road, suddenly he went crashing into a pit. On came his
pursuer, spear at poise. Suddenly a brilliant flash of light seemed to shoot
out of the pit, and the fallen horse leapt with it into the air and was again
on firm earth.
A bright glory surrounds the child of the imperial line, now in danger,
The powerful charger forces his way through the press of battle,
Bearing to safety him who was destined to the throne two score years and two;
And the general thus manifested his godlike courage.
This apparition frightened Zhang He, who abandoned the pursuit forthwith, and
Zhao Zilong rode off.
Presently he heard shouts behind, âZhao Zilong, Zhao Zilong, stop!â and at
the same time he saw ahead of him two generals who seemed disposed to dispute
his way.
Ma Yan and Zhang Zi following and Jiao Chu and Zhang Neng in front, his state
seemed desperate, but Zhao Zilong quailed not.
As the men of Cao Cao came pressing on, Zhao Zilong drew Cao Caoâs own sword
to beat them off. Nothing could resist the blue blade sword. Armor, clothing,
it went through without effort and blood gushed forth in fountains wherever it
struck. So the four generals were soon beaten off, and Zhao Zilong was once
again free.
Now Cao Cao from a hilltop of the Prospect Mountain saw these deeds of derring-
do and a general showing such valor that none could withstand him, so Cao Cao
asked of his followers whether any knew the man. No one recognized him.
So Cao Hong galloped down into the plain and shouted out, âWe should hear the
name of the warrior!â
âI am Zhao Zilong of Changshan!â replied Zhao Zilong.
Cao Hong returned and told his lord, who said, âA very tiger of a leader! I
must get him alive.â
Whereupon he sent horsemen to all detachments with orders that no arrows were
to be fired from an ambush at any point Zhao Zilong should pass: He was to be
taken alive.
And so Zhao Zilong escaped most imminent danger, and Liu Shanâs safety, bound
up with his saviorâs, was also secured. On this career of slaughter which
ended in safety, Zhao Zilong, bearing in his bosom the child lord Liu Shan, cut
down two main banners, took three spears, and slew or wounded of Cao Caoâs
generals half a hundred, all men of renown.
Blood dyed the fighting robe and crimsoned his buff coat;
None dared engage the terrible warrior at Dangyang;
In the days of old lived the brave Zhao Zilong,
Who fought in the battlefield for his lord in danger.
Having thus fought his way out of the press, Zhao Zilong lost no time in
getting away from the battle field. His white battle robe had turned red,
soaking in blood.
On his way, near the rise of the hills, he met with two other bodies of troops
under two brothers, Zhong Jin and Zhong Shen. One of these was armed with a
massive ax, the other a halberd.
As soon as they saw Zhao Zilong, they knew him and shouted, âQuickly dismount
and be bound!â
He has only escaped from the tiger cave,
To risk the dragon poolâs sounding wave.
How Zhao Zilong escaped will be next related.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 42 ****
As related in the last chapter two generals appeared in front of Zhao Zilong,
who rode at them with his spear ready for a thrust. Zhong Jin was leading,
flourishing his battle-ax. Zhao Zilong engaged and very soon unhorsed him. Then
Zhao Zilong galloped away. Zhong Shen rode up behind ready with his halberd,
and his horseâs nose got so close to the otherâs tail that Zhao Zilong
could see in his armor the reflection of the play of Zhong Shenâs weapon.
Then suddenly, and without warning, Zhao Zilong wheeled round his horse so that
he faced his pursuer, and their two steeds struck breast to breast. With his
spear in his left hand, Zhao Zilong warded off the halberd strokes, and in his
right he swung the blue blade sword. One slash and he had cut through both
helmet and head. Zhong Shen fell to the ground, a corpse with only half a head
on his body. His followers fled, and Zhao Zilong retook the road toward Long
Slope Bridge.
But in his rear arose another tumultuous shouting, seeming to rend the very
sky, and Wen Ping came up behind. However, although the man was weary and his
steed spent, Zhao Zilong got close to the bridge where he saw standing, all
ready for any fray, Zhang Fei.
âHelp me, Zhang Fei!â he cried and crossed the bridge.
âHasten!â cried Zhang Fei, âI will keep back the pursuers!â
About seven miles from the bridge, Zhao Zilong saw Liu Bei with his followers
reposing in the shade of some trees. He dismounted and drew near, weeping. The
tears also started to Liu Beiâs eyes when he saw his commander.
Still panting from his exertions, Zhao Zilong gasped out, âMy fault â-death
is too light a punishment. Lady Mi was severely wounded. She refused my horse
and threw herself into a well. She is dead, and all I could do was to fill in
the well with the rubbish that lay around. But I placed the babe in the breast
of my fighting robe and have won my way out of the press of battle. Thanks to
the little lordâs grand luck I have escaped. At first he cried a good deal,
but for some time now he has not stirred or made a sound. I fear I may not have
saved his life after all.â
Then Zhao Zilong opened his robe and looked: The child was fast asleep.
âHappily, Sir, your son is unhurt,â said Zhao Zilong as he drew him forth
and presented him in both hands.
Liu Bei took the child but threw it aside angrily, saying, âTo preserve that
suckling I very nearly lost a great general!â
Zhao Zilong picked up the child again and, weeping, said, âWere I ground to
powder, I could not prove my gratitude.â
From out Cao Caoâs host a tiger rushed,
His wish but to destroy;
Though Liu Beiâs consort lost her life,
Zhao Zilong preserved her boy.
âToo great the risk you ran to save
This child,â the father cried.
To show he rated Zhao Zilong high,
He threw his son aside.
Wen Ping and his company pursued Zhao Zilong till they saw Zhang Feiâs
bristling mustache and fiercely glaring eyes before them. There he was seated
on his battle steed, his hand grasping his terrible serpent spear, guarding the
bridge. They also saw great clouds of dust rising above the trees and concluded
they would fall into an ambush if they ventured across the bridge. So they
stopped the pursuit, not daring to advance further.
In a little time Cao Ren, Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, Li Dian, Yue Jing, Zhang
Liao, Xu Chu, Zhang He, and other generals of Cao Cao came up, but none dared
advance, frightened not only by Zhang Feiâs fierce look, but lest they should
become victims of a ruse of Zhuge Liang. As they came up, they formed a line on
the west side, halting till they could inform their lord of the position.
As soon as the messengers arrived and Cao Cao heard about it, he mounted and
rode to the bridge to see for himself. Zhang Feiâs fierce eye scanning the
hinder position of the army opposite him saw the silken umbrella, the axes and
banners coming along, and concluded that Cao Cao came to see for himself how
matters stood.
So in a mighty voice he shouted: âI am Zhang Fei of Yan. Who dares fight with
me?â
At the sound of this thunderous voice, a terrible quaking fear seized upon Cao
Cao, and he bade them take the umbrella away.
Turning to his followers, he said, âGuan Yu had said that his brother Zhang
Fei was the sort of man to go through an army of a hundred legions and take the
head of its commander-in-chief, and do it easily. Now here is this terror in
front of us, and we must be careful.â
As he finished speaking, again that terrible voice was heard, âI am Zhang Fei
of Yan.Who dares fight with me?â
Cao Cao, seeing his enemy so fierce and resolute, was too frightened to think
of anything but retreat.
Zhang Fei, seeing a movement going on in the rear, once again shook his spear
and roared, âWhat mean you? You will not fight nor do you run away!â
This roar had scarcely begun when one of Cao Caoâs staff, Xiahou Jie, reeled
and fell from his horse terror-stricken, paralyzed with fear. The panic touched
Cao Cao and spread to his whole surroundings, and he and his staff galloped for
their lives. They were as frightened as a suckling babe at a clap of thunder or
a weak woodcutter at the roar of a tiger. Many threw away their spears, dropped
their casques and fled, a wave of panic-stricken humanity, a tumbling mass of
terrified horses. None thought of ought but flight, and those who ran trampled
the bodies of fallen comrades under foot.
Zhang Fei was wrathful; and who dared
To accept his challenge? Fierce he glared;
His thunderous voice rolled out, and then
In terror fled Cao Caoâs armed soldiers.
Panic-stricken Cao Cao galloped westward with the rest, thinking of nothing but
getting away. He lost his headdress, and his loosened hair streamed behind him.
Presently Zhang Liao and Xu Chu came up with him and seized his bridle; fear
had deprived him of all self-control.
âDo not be frightened,â said Zhang Liao. âAfter all Zhang Fei is but one
man and not worthy of extravagant fear. If you will only return and attack, you
will capture your enemy.â
That time Cao Cao had somewhat overcome his panic and become reasonable. Two
generals were ordered back to the bridge to reconnoiter.
Zhang Fei saw the disorderly rout of the enemy but he dared not pursue.
However, he bade his score or so of dust-raising followers to cut loose the
branches from their horsesâ tails and come to help destroy the bridge. This
done he went to report to his brother and told him of the destruction of the
bridge.
âBrave as you are, brother, and no one is braver, but you are no
strategist,â said Liu Bei.
âWhat mean you, brother?â
âCao Cao is very deep. You are no match for him. The destruction of the
bridge will bring him in pursuit.â
âIf he ran away at a yell of mine, think you he will dare return?â
âIf you had left the bridge, he would have thought there was an ambush and
would not have dared to pass it. Now the destruction of the bridge tells him we
are weak and fearful, and he will pursue. He does not mind a broken bridge. His
legions could fill up the biggest rivers that we could get across.â
So orders were given to march, and they went by a bye-road which led diagonally
to Hanjin by the road of Minyang.
The two generals sent by Cao Cao to reconnoiter near Long Slope Bridge
returned, saying, âThe bridge has been destroyed. Zhang Fei has left.â
âThen he is afraid,â said Cao Cao.
Cao Cao at once gave orders to set ten thousand men at work on three floating
bridges to be finished that night.
Li Dian said, âI fear this is one of the wiles of Zhuge Liang. So be
careful.â
âZhang Fei is just a bold warrior, but there is no guile about him,â said
Cao Cao.
He gave orders for immediate advance.
Liu Bei was making all speed to Hanjin. Suddenly there appeared in his track a
great cloud of dust whence came loud rolls of drums and shoutings.
Liu Bei was dismayed and said, âBefore us rolls the Great River; behind is
the pursuer. What hope is there for us?â
But he bade Zhao Zilong organize a defense.
Now Cao Cao in an order to his army had said, âLiu Bei is a fish in the fish
kettle, a tiger in the pit. Catch him this time, or the fish will get back to
the sea and the tiger escape to the mountains. Therefore every general must use
his best efforts to press on.â
In consequence every leader bade those under him hasten forward. And they were
pressing on at great speed, when suddenly a body of soldiers appeared from the
hills and a voice cried, âI have waited here a long time!â
The leader who had shouted this bore in his hand the green-dragon saber and
rode Red Hare, for indeed it was no other than Guan Yu. He had gone to Jiangxia
for help and had returned with a whole legion of ten thousand. Having heard of
the battle, he had taken this very road to intercept pursuit.
As soon as Guan Yu appeared, Cao Cao stopped and said to his officers, âHere
we are, tricked again by that Zhuge Liang!â
Without more ado he ordered a retreat. Guan Yu followed him some three miles
and then drew off to act as guard to his elder brother on his way to the river.
There boats were ready, and Liu Bei and family went on board. When all were
settled comfortably in the boat, Guan Yu asked where was his sister, the second
wife of his brother, Lady Mi. Then Liu Bei told him the story of Dangyang.
âAlas!â said Guan Yu. âHad you taken my advice that day of the hunting in
Xutian, we should have escaped the misery of this day.â
âBut,â said Liu Bei, âon that day it was âWare damaged when pelting
rats.ââ
Just as Liu Bei spoke, he heard war drums on the south bank. A fleet of boats,
thick as a flight of ants, came running up with swelling sails before the fair
wind. He was alarmed.
The boats came nearer. There Liu Bei saw the white clad figure of a man wearing
a silver helmet who stood in the prow of the foremost ship.
The leader cried, âAre you all right, my uncle? I am very guilty.â
It was Liu Qi. He bowed low as the ship passed, saying, âI heard you were in
danger from Cao Cao, and I have come to aid you.â
Liu Bei welcomed Liu Qi with joy, and his soldiers joined in with the main
body, and the whole fleet sailed on, while they told each other their
adventures.
Unexpectedly in the southwest there appeared a line of fighting ships swishing
up before a fair wind.
Liu Qi said, âAll my troops are here, and now there is an enemy barring the
way. If they are not Cao Caoâs ships, they must be from the South Land. We
have a poor chance. What now?â
Liu Bei went to the prow and gazed at them. Presently he made out a figure in a
turban and Daoist robe sitting in the bows of one of the boats and knew it to
be Zhuge Liang. Behind him stood Sun Qian.
When they were quite near, Liu Bei asked Zhuge Liang how he came to be there.
And Zhuge Liang reported what he had done, saying, âWhen I reached Jiangxia,
I sent Guan Yu to land at Hanjin with reinforcements, for I feared pursuit from
Cao Cao and knew that road you would take instead of Jiangling. So I prayed
your nephew to go to meet you, while I went to Xiakou to muster as many
soldiers as possible.â
The new-comers added to their strength, and they began once more to consider
how their powerful enemy might be overcome.
Said Zhuge Liang, âXiakou is strong and a good strategic point. It is also
rich and suited for a lengthy stay. I would ask you, my lord, to make it a
permanent camp. Your nephew can go to Jiangxia to get the fleet in order and
prepare weapons. Thus we can create two threatening angles for our position. If
we all return to Jiangxia, the position will be weakened.â
Liu Qi replied, âThe Directing Instructorâs words are excellent, but I wish
rather my uncle stayed awhile in Jiangxia till the army was in thorough order.
Then he could go to Xiakou.â
âYou speak to the point, nephew,â replied Liu Bei.
Then leaving Guan Yu with five thousand troops at Xiakou he, with Zhuge Liang
and his nephew, went to Jiangxia.
When Cao Cao saw Guan Yu with a force ready to attack, he feared lest a greater
number were hidden away behind, so he stopped the pursuit. He also feared lest
Liu Bei should take Jiangling, so he marched thither with all haste.
The two officers in command at Jingzhou City, Deng Yi and Liu Xin, had heard of
the death of their lord Liu Zong at Xiangyang and, knowing that there was no
chance of successful defense against Cao Caoâs armies, they led out the
people of Jingzhou to the outskirts and offered submission. Cao Cao entered the
city and, after restoring order and confidence, he released Han Song and gave
him the dignified office of Director of Ambassadorial Receptions. He rewarded
the others.
Then said Cao Cao, âLiu Bei has gone to Jiangxia and may ally himself with
the South Land, and the opposition to me will be greater. Can he be
destroyed?â
Xun You said, âThe splendor of your achievements has spread wide. Therefore
you might send a messenger to invite Sun Quan to a grand hunting party at
Jiangxia, and you two could seize Liu Bei, share Jingzhou with Sun Quan, and
make a solemn treaty. Sun Quan will be too frightened not to come over to you,
and your end will be gained.â
Cao Cao agreed. He sent the letters by a messenger, and he prepared his army
â-horse and foot and marines. He had in all eight hundred thirty thousand
troops, but he called them a million. The attack was to be by land and water at
the same time.
The fleet advanced up the river in two lines. On the west it extended to
Jingxia, on the east to Qichun. The stockades stretched one hundred miles.
The story of Cao Caoâs movements and successes reached Sun Quan, then in camp
at Chaisang. He assembled his strategists to decide on a scheme of defense.
Lu Su said, âJingzhou is contiguous to our borders. It is strong and
defensive, its people are rich. It is the sort of country that an emperor or a
king should have. Liu Biaoâs recent death gives an excuse for me to be sent
to convey condolence and, once there, I shall be able to talk over Liu Bei and
the officers of the late Imperial Protector to combine with you against Cao
Cao. If Liu Bei does as I wish, then success is yours.â
Sun Quan thought this a good plan, so he had the necessary letters prepared,
and the gifts, and sent Lu Su with them.
All this time Liu Bei was at Jiangxia where, with Zhuge Liang and Liu Qi, he
was endeavoring to evolve a good plan of campaign.
Zhuge Liang said, âCao Caoâs power is too great for us to cope with. Let us
go over to the South Land and ask help from Sun Quan. If we can set north and
south at grips, we ought to be able to get some advantage from our intermediate
position between them.â
âBut will they be willing to have anything to do with us?â said Liu Bei.
âThe South Land is a large and populous country, and Sun Quan has ambitions
of his own.â
Zhuge Liang replied, âCao Cao with his army of a million holds the Han River
and a half of the Great River. The South Land will certainly send to find out
all possible about the position. Should any messenger come, I shall borrow a
little boat and make a little trip over the river and trust to my little lithe
tongue to set north and south at each otherâs throats. If the south wins, we
will assist in destroying Cao Cao in order to get Jingzhou. If the north wins,
we shall profit by the victory to get the South Land. So we shall get some
advantage either way.â
âThat is a very fine view to take,â said Liu Bei. âBut how are you going
to get hold of anyone from the South Land to talk to?â
Liu Beiâs question was answered by the arrival of Lu Su, and as the ship
touched the bank and the envoy came ashore, Zhuge Liang laughed, saying, âIt
is done!â
Turning to Liu Qi he asked, âWhen Sun Ce died, did your country send any
condolences?â
âIt is impossible there would be any mourning courtesies between them and us.
We had caused the death of his father, Sun Jian.â
âThen it is certain that this envoy does not come to present condolences but
to spy out the land.â
So he said to Liu Bei, âWhen Lu Su asks about the movements of Cao Cao, you
will know nothing. If he presses the matter, say he can ask me.â
Having thus prepared their scheme, they sent to welcome the envoy, who entered
the city in mourning garb. The gifts having been accepted, Liu Qi asked Lu Su
to meet Liu Bei. When the introductory ceremonies were over, the three men went
to one of the inner chambers to drink a cup of wine.
Presently Lu Su said to Liu Bei, âBy reputation I have known you a long time,
Uncle Liu Bei, but till today I have not met you. I am very gratified at seeing
you. You have been fighting Cao Cao, though, lately, so I suppose you know all
about him. Has he really so great an army? How many, do you think, he has?â
âMy army was so small that we fled whenever we heard of his approach. So I do
not know how many he had.â
âYou had the advice of Zhuge Liang, and you used fire on Cao Cao twice. You
burned him almost to death so that you can hardly say you know nothing about
his soldiers,â said Lu Su.
âWithout asking my adviser, I really do not know the details.â
âWhere is Zhuge Liang? I should like to see him,â said Lu Su.
So they sent for him, and he was introduced.
When the ceremonies were over, Lu Su said, âI have long admired your genius
but have never been fortunate enough to meet you. Now that I have met you, I
hope I may speak of present politics.â
Replied Zhuge Liang, âI know all Cao Caoâs infamies and wickednesses, but
to my regret we were not strong enough to withstand him. That is why we avoided
him.â
âIs the Imperial Uncle going to stay here?â
âThe Princely One is an old friend of Wu Ju, Governor of Changwu, and intends
to go to him.â
âWu Ju has few troops and insufficient supplies. He cannot ensure safety for
himself. How can he receive the Uncle?â said Lu Su.
âChangwu is not one to remain in long, but it is good enough for the present.
We can make other plans for the future.â
Lu Su said, âSun Quan is strongly posted in the six southern territories and
is exceedingly well supplied. He treats able people and scholars with the
greatest courtesy and so they gather round him. Now if you are seeking a plan
for your Prince, you cannot do better than send some friend to confer with
him.â
âThere have never been any relations between my master and yours,â said
Zhuge Liang. âI fear there would be nothing but a waste of words. Besides, we
have no one to send.â
âYour elder brother Zhuge Jin is there as adviser and is longing to see you.
I am but a simple wight, but I should be pleased to discuss affairs with my
master and you.â
âBut Zhuge Liang is my Directing Instructor,â said Liu Bei, âand I cannot
do without him. He cannot go.â
Lu Su pressed him. Liu Bei pretended to refuse permission.
âIt is important. I pray you give me leave to go,â said Zhuge Liang.
Then Liu Bei consented. And they soon took leave and the two set out by boat
for Sun Quanâs headquarters.
A little boat sailed down the stream
With Zhuge Liang well content;
For he could see his enemies
To fiery perdition sent.
The result of this journey will appear in the following chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 43 ****
In the boat on the way to Chaisang, the two travelers beguiled the time by
discussing affairs.
Lu Su impressed upon his companion, saying, âWhen you see my master, do not
reveal the truth about the magnitude of Cao Caoâs army.â
âYou do not have to remind me,â replied Zhuge Liang, âbut I shall know
how to reply.â
When the boat arrived, Zhuge Liang was lodged in the guestsâ quarters, and Lu
Su went alone to see his master. Lu Su found Sun Quan actually at a council,
assembled to consider the situation. Lu Su was summoned thereto and questioned
at once upon what he had discovered.
âI know the general outline, but I want a little time to prepare my
report,â replied Lu Su.
Then Sun Quan produced Cao Caoâs letter and gave it to Lu Su.
âThat came yesterday. I have sent the bearer of it back, and this gathering
is to consider the reply,â said he.
Lu Su read the letter:
âWhen I, the Prime Minister, received the imperial command to punish a fault,
my banners went south and Liu Zong became my prisoner, while the people of
Jingzhou flocked to my side at the first rumor of my coming. Under my hand are
one million strong and a thousand able leaders. My desire is, General, that we
go on a great hunting expedition into Jiangxia and together attack Liu Bei. We
will share his land between us, and we will swear perpetual amity. If happily
you would not be a mere looker-on, I pray you reply quickly.â
âWhat have you decided upon, my lord?â asked Lu Su as he finished the
letter.
âI have not yet decided.â
Then Zhang Zhao said, âIt would be imprudent to withstand Cao Caoâs hundred
legions backed by the imperial authority. Moreover, your most important defense
against him is the Great River; and since Cao Cao has gained possession of
Jingzhou, the river is his ally against us. We cannot withstand him, and the
only way to tranquillity, in my opinion, is submission.â
âThe words of the speaker accord with the manifest decree of providence,â
echoed all the assembly.
Sun Quan remaining silent and thoughtful.
Zhang Zhao again took up the argument, saying, âDo not hesitate, my lord.
Submission to Cao Cao means tranquillity to the people of the South Land and
safety for the inhabitants of the six territories.â
Sun Quan still remained silent. His head bent in deep thought. Presently he
arose and paced slowly out at the door, and Lu Su followed him.
Outside he took Lu Su by the hand, saying, âWhat do you desire?â
âWhat they have all been saying is very derogatory to you. A common person
might submit. You cannot.â
âWhy? How do you explain that?â
âIf people like us servants submitted, we would just return to our village or
continue holding our offices, and everything would go on as before. If you
submit, whither will you go? You will be created a lord of some humble fief,
perhaps. You will have one carriage, no more; one saddle horse, that is all.
Your retinue will be some ten. Will you be able to sit facing the south and
call yourself by the kingly title of âThe Solitaryâ? Each one in that crowd
of hangers-on is thinking for himself, is purely selfish, and you should not
listen to them, but take a line of your own and that quickly. Determine to play
a bold game!â
Sun Quan sighed, âThey all talk and talk: They miss my point of view. Now you
have just spoken of a bold game, and your view is the same as mine. Surely God
has expressly sent you to me. Still Cao Cao is now the stronger by all Yuan
Shaoâs and Liu Biaoâs armies, and he has possession of Jingzhou. I fear he
is almost too powerful to contend with.â
âI have brought back with me Zhuge Liang, the younger brother of our Zhuge
Jin. If you questioned him, he would explain clearly.â
âIs Master Sleeping Dragon really here?â
âReally here, in the guest-house.â
âIt is too late to see him today. But tomorrow I will assemble my officials,
and you will introduce him to all my best. After that we will debate the
matter.â
With these instructions Lu Su retired.
Next day he went to the guest-house and conveyed Sun Quanâs commands to the
guest, particularly saying, âWhen you see my master, say nothing of the
magnitude of Cao Caoâs army.â
Zhuge Liang smiled, saying, âI shall act as circumstances dictate. You may be
sure I shall make no mistakes.â
Zhuge Liang was then conducted to where the high officers, civil and military
to the number of forty and more, were assembled. They formed a dignified
conclave as they sat in stately ranks with their tall headdresses and broad
girdles.
Zhang Zhao sat at the head, and Zhuge Liang first saluted him. Then, one by
one, he exchange the formal courtesies with them all. This done he took his
seat in the guestâs chair.
They, on their part, noted with interest Zhuge Liangâs refined and elegant
manner and his commanding figure, thinking within themselves, âHere is a
persuader fitted for discourse.â
Zhang Zhao led the way in trying to bait the visitor. He said, âYou will
pardon the most insignificant of our official circle, myself, if I mention that
people say you compare yourself with those two famous men of talent, Guan Zhong
and Yue Yi. Is there any truth in this?â
âTo a trifling extent I have compared myself with them,â replied Zhuge
Liang.
âI have heard that Liu Bei made three journeys to visit you when you lived in
retirement in your simple dwelling in the Sleeping Dragon Ridge, and that when
you consented to serve him, he said he was as lucky as a fish in getting home
to the ocean. Then he desired to possess the region about Jingzhou. Yet today
all that country belongs to Cao Cao. I should like to hear your account of all
that.â
Zhuge Liang thought, âThis Zhang Zhao is Sun Quanâs first adviser. Unless I
can nonplus him, I shall never have a chance with his master.â
So he replied, âIn my opinion the taking of the region around the Han River
was as simple as turning over oneâs hand. But my master Liu Bei is both
righteous and humane and would not stoop to filching the possession of a member
of his own house. So he refused the offer of succession. But Liu Zong, a stupid
lad, misled by specious words, submitted to Cao Cao and fell victim to his
ferocity. My master is in camp at Jiangxia, but what his future plans may be
cannot be divulged at present.â
Zhang Zhao said, âBe it so; but your words and your deeds are something
discordant. You say you are the equal of the two famous ones. Well, Guan Zhong,
as minister of Prince Huan, put his master at the very head of the feudal
nobles, making his masterâs will supreme in all the land. Under the able
statesmanship of Yue Yi, the feeble state of Yan conquered Qi, reducing nearly
seventy of its cities. These two were men of most commanding and conspicuous
talent.
âWhen you lived in retirement, you smiled scornfully at ordinary people,
passed your days in idleness, nursing your knees and posing in a superior
manner, implying that if you had control of affairs, Liu Bei would be more than
human; he should bring good to everybody and remove all evil; rebellion and
robbery would be no more. Poor Liu Bei, before he obtained your help, was an
outcast and a vagabond, stealing a city here and there where he could. With you
to help him, he was to become the cynosure of every eye, and every lisping
school child was to say that he was a tiger who had grown wings; the Hans were
to be restored and Cao Cao and his faction exterminated; the good old days
would be restored, and all the people who had been driven into retirement by
the corruption of political life would wake up, rub the sleep out of their
eyes, and be in readiness to lift the cloud of darkness that covered the sky
and gaze up at the glorious brilliancy of the sun and moon, to pull the people
out of fire and water and put all the world to rest on a couch of comfort. That
was all supposed to happen forthwith.
âWhy then, when you went to Xinye, did not Cao Caoâs army throw aside their
arms and armors and flee like rats? Why could you not have told Liu Biao how to
give tranquillity to his people? Why could you not aid his orphan son to
protect his frontiers? Instead you abandoned Xinye and fled to Fancheng; you
were defeated at Dangyang and fled to Xiakou with no place to rest in. Thus,
after you had joined Liu Bei, he was worse off than before. Was it thus with
Guan Zhong and Yue Yi? I trust you do not mind my blunt speech.â
Zhuge Liang waited till Zhang Zhao had closed his oration, then laughed and
said, âHow can the common birds understand the long flight of the cranes? Let
me use an illustration. A man has fallen into a terrible malady. First the
physician must administer hashish, then soothing drugs until his viscera shall
be calmed into harmonious action. When the sick manâs body shall have been
reduced to quietude, then may he be given strong meats to strengthen him and
powerful drugs to correct the disorder. Thus the disease will be quite
expelled, and the man restored to health. If the physician does not wait till
the humors and pulse are in harmony, but throws in his strong drugs too early,
it will be difficult to restore the patient.
âMy master suffered defeat at Runan and went to Liu Biao. He had then less
than one thousand soldiers and only three generals â-Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and
Zhao Zilong. That was indeed a time of extreme weakness. Xinye was a secluded,
rustic town with few inhabitants and scanty supplies, and my master only
retired there as a temporary refuge. How could he even think of occupying and
holding it? Yet, with insufficient force, in a weak city, with untrained men
and inadequate supplies, we burned Xiahou Dun at Bowang Slope, drowned Cao Ren
and Cao Hong and their army in the White River, and set them in terror as they
fled. I doubt whether the two ancient heroes would have done any better. As to
the surrender of Liu Zong, Liu Bei knew nothing of it. And he was too noble and
too righteous to take advantage of a kinsmanâs straits to seize his
inheritance. As for the defeat at Dangyang, it must be remembered that Liu Bei
was hampered with a huge voluntary following of common people, with their aged
relatives and their children, whom he was too humane to abandon. He never
thought of taking Jiangling, but willingly suffered with his people. This is a
striking instance of his magnanimity.
âSmall forces are no match for large armies. Victory and defeat are common
episodes in every campaign. The great Founder of the Hans suffered many defeats
at the hands of Xiang Yu, but Liu Bang finally conquered at Gaixia, and that
battle was decisive. Was not this due to the strategy of Han Xin who, though he
had long served Liu Bang, had never won a victory. Indeed real statesmanship
and the restoration of stable government is a master plan far removed from the
vapid discourses and debates of a lot of bragging babblers and specious and
deceitful talkers, who, as they themselves say, are immeasureably superior to
the rest of humankind but who, when it comes to deeds and decisions to meet the
infinite and constant vicissitudes of affairs, fail to throw up a single
capable person. Truly such people are the laughing stock of all the world.â
Zhang Zhao found no reply to this diatribe.
But another in the assembly lifted up his voice, saying, âBut what of Cao
Caoâs present position? There he is, encamped with one hundred legions and a
thousand leaders. Whither he goes he is invincible as wriggling dragon, and
whither he looks he is as fearsome as roaring tiger. He seems to have taken
Jiangxia already, as we see.â
The speaker was Yu Fan.
And Zhuge Liang replied, âCao Cao has acquired the swarms of Yuan Shao and
stolen the crowds of Liu Biao. Yet I care not for all his mob legions.â
Yu Fan smiled icily, saying, âWhen you got thrashed at Dangyang and in
desperation sent this way and that to ask help, even then did you not care? But
do you think big talk really takes people in?â
Zhuge Liang replied, âLiu Bei had a few thousand scrupulous soldiers to
oppose against a million fierce brutes. He retired to Xiakou for breathing
space. The South Land have strong and good soldiers, and there are ample
supplies, and the Great River is a defense. Is now a time for you to convince
your lord to bend the knee before a renegade, to be careless of his honor and
reputation? As a fact Liu Bei is not the sort of man to fear such a rebel as
Cao Cao.â
Yu Fan had nothing to reply.
Next, Bu Zhi, who was among those seated, said, âWill you talk of our
southern land with a tongue like the tongues of the persuaders Zhang Yi and Su
Qin in the ancient time?â
Zhuge Liang replied, âYou regard those two as mere speculative talkers; you
do not recognize them also as heroes. Su Qin bore the Prime Ministersâ seals
of six federated states; Zhang Yi was twice Prime Minister of the state of Qin.
Both were men of conspicuous ability who brought about the reformation of their
governments. They are not to be compared with those who quail before the strong
and overbear the weak, who fear the dagger and run away from the sword. You,
Sir, have listened to Cao Caoâs crafty and empty threat, and it has
frightened you into advising surrender. Dare you ridicule Su Qin and Zhang
Yi?â
Bu Zhi was silenced.
Then suddenly another interjected the question, âWhat do you think of Cao
Cao?â
It was Xue Zong who had spoken.
And Zhuge Liang replied, âCao Cao is one of the rebels against the dynasty.
Why ask about him?â
âYou are mistaken,â said Xue Zong. âThe Hans have outlasted their
allotted time, and the end is near. Cao Cao already has two-thirds of the
empire, and people are turning to him. Your master has not recognized the
fateful moment, and to contend with a man so strong is to try to smash stones
with eggs. Failure is certain.â
Zhuge Liang angrily replied, âWhy do you speak so undutiful words, as if you
knew neither father nor prince? Loyalty and filial duty are the essentials of a
personâs being. For a minister of Han, correct conduct demands that one is
pledged to the destruction of anyone who does not follow the canon of a
ministerâs duty. Cao Caoâs forbears enjoyed the bounty of Han, but instead
of showing gratitude, he nourishes in his bosom thoughts of rebellion. The
whole world is incensed against him, and yet you would claim for him the
indication of destiny. Truly you are a man who knows neither father nor prince,
a man unworthy of any words, and I decline to argue with you further.â
The blush of shame overspread Xue Zongâs face, and he said no more.
But another, Lu Ji, took up the dispute and said, âAlthough Cao Cao overawes
the Emperor and in his name coerces the nobles, yet he is the descendant of the
Supreme Ancestorâs Prime Minister Cao Shen; while your master, though he says
he is descended from a prince, has no proof thereof. In the eyes of the world,
Liu Bei is just a weaver of mats, a seller of straw shoes. Who is he to strive
with Cao Cao?â
Zhuge Liang laughed and replied, âAre you not that Lu Ji who pocketed the
orange when you were sitting among Yuan Shuâs guests? Listen to me: I have a
word to say to you. Inasmuch as Cao Cao is a descendant of a minister of state,
he is by heredity a servant of the Hans. But now he has monopolized all state
authority and knows only his own arbitrary will, heaping every indignity upon
his lord. Not only does he forget his prince, but he ignores his ancestors; not
only is he a rebellious servant of Han, but the renegade of his family. Liu Bei
of Yuzhou is a noble scion of the imperial family upon whom the Emperor has
conferred rank, as is recorded in the annals. How then can you say there is no
evidence of his imperial origin? Beside, the very founder of the dynasty was
himself of lowly origin, and yet he became emperor. Where is the shame in
weaving mats and selling shoes? Your mean, immature views are unfit to be
mentioned in the presence of scholars of standing.â
This put a stop to Lu Jiâs flow of eloquence.
But another of those present said, âZhuge Liangâs words are overbearing,
and he distorts reason. It is not proper argument, and he had better say no
more. But I would ask him what classical canon he studied.â
Zhuge Liang looked at his interlocutor, who was Yan Jun, and said, âThe
dryasdusts of every age select passages and choose phrases. What else are they
good for? Do they ever initiate a policy or manage an affair? Yi Yin, who was a
farmer in the state of Shen, and Lu Wang, the fisherman of the River Wei, Zhang
Liang and Chen Ping, Zheng Yu and Geng Yan â-all were men of transcendent
ability, but I have never inquired what classical canon they followed or on
whose essays they formed their style. Would you liken them to your rusty
students of books, whose journeyings are comprised between their brush and
their inkstone, who spend their days in literary futilities, wasting both time
and ink?â
No reply was forthcoming. Yan Jun hung his head with shame.
But another disputant, Cheng Deshu by name, suddenly shouted, âYou are
mightily fond of big words, Sir, but they do not give any proof of your
scholarship after all. I am inclined to think that a real scholar would just
laugh at you.â
Zhuge Liang replied, âThere is the noble scholar, loyal and patriotic, of
perfect rectitude and a hater of any crookedness. The concern of such a scholar
is to act in full sympathy with his day and leave to future ages a fine
reputation. There is the scholar of the mean type, a pedant and nothing more.
He labors constantly with his pen, in his callow youth composing odes and in
hoary age still striving to understand the classical books completely.
Thousands of words flow from his pen, but there is not a solid idea in his
breast. He may, as did Yang Xiong, glorify the age with his writings and yet
stoop to serve a tyrant such as Wang Mang. No wonder Yang Xiong threw himself
out of a window; he had to. That is the way of the scholar of mean type. Though
he composes odes by the hundred, what is the use of him?â
Cheng Deshu could make no reply. The other officers now began to hold this man
of torrential speech in wholesome fear.
Only two of them, Zhang Wen and Luo Tong, had failed to challenge him, but when
they would have tried to pose Zhuge Liang, suddenly someone appeared from
without and angrily shouted, âThis is not paying fit respect to a guest. You
have among you the most wonderful man of the day, and you all sit there trying
to entangle him in speech while our archenemy Cao Cao is nearing our borders.
Instead of discussing how to oppose Cao Cao, you are all wrangling and
disputing!â
All eyes turned toward the speaker. It was Huang Gai of Lingling, who was the
Chief of the Commissariat of the South Land.
He turned to address Zhuge Liang, saying, âThere is a saying that though
something may be gained by talk, there is more to be got by silence. Why not
give my lord the advantage of your valuable advice instead of wasting time in
discussion with this crowd?â
âThey did not understand,â replied Zhuge Liang, âand it was necessary to
enlighten them, so I had to speak.â
As Huang Gai and Lu Su led the guest toward their masterâs apartments, they
met his brother Zhuge Jin. Zhuge Liang saluted him with the deference due to an
elder brother.
Zhuge Jin said, âWhy have you not been to see me, brother?â
âI am now in the service of Liu Bei of Yuzhou, and it is right that public
affairs precede private obligations. I cannot attend to any private matters
till my work is done. You must pardon me, brother.â
âAfter you have seen Marquis Sun Quan, you will come and tell me your
news,â said he as he left.
As they went along to the audience chamber, Lu Su again cautioned Zhuge Liang
against any rash speech, saying, âDo not tell the magnitude of Cao Caoâs
forces. Please remember.â
The latter nodded but made no other reply. When they reached the hall, Sun Quan
came down the steps to welcome his guests and was extraordinarily gracious.
After the mutual salutations, the guest was given a chair while the Marquisâ
officials were drawn up in two lines, on one side the civil, on the other the
military. Lu Su stood beside Zhuge Liang and listened to his introductory
speech.
As Zhuge Liang spoke of Liu Beiâs intentions, he glanced up at his host. He
noted the green eyes and purple beard and the dignified commanding air of the
man and thought within himself, âCertainly in appearance this is no common
man. He is one to be incited perhaps, but not to be persuaded. It will be
better to see what he has to say first, then I will try to stir him to
action.â
The serving of tea being now finished, Sun Quan began with the usual gracious
ceremonial expressions.
âLu Su has often spoken of your genius,â said the host. âIt is a great
pleasure to meet you. I trust you will confer upon me the advantage of your
instruction.â
âI am neither clever nor learned,â was the reply. âIt humiliates me to
hear such words.â
âYou have been at Xinye lately, and you helped your master to fight that
decisive battle with Cao Cao, so you must know exactly the measure of his
military strength.â
âMy masterâs army was small and his generals were few; the city was paltry
and lacked supplies. Hence no stand could be made against such a force as Cao
Cao had.â
âHow many has he in all?â
âHorse and foot, land and marine, he has a million.â
âIs there not some doubt about that?â said Sun Quan, surprised.
âNone whatever. When Cao Cao went to Yanzhou, he had the two hundred thousand
soldiers of Qingzhou. He gained five or six hundred thousand more when Yuan
Shao fell. He has three or four hundred thousand troops newly recruited in the
capital. Lately he has acquired two or three hundred thousand troops in
Jingzhou. And if these be reckoned up, the total is not less than a million and
a half. Hence I said a million for I was afraid of frightening your
officers.â
Lu Su was much disturbed and turned pale. He looked meaningfully at the bold
speaker, but Zhuge Liang would not see. Sun Quan went on to ask if his
archenemy had a corresponding number of leaders.
âCao Cao has enough administrators and strategists to control such a host,
and his capable and veteran leaders are more than a thousand; perhaps more than
two thousand.â
âWhat will be Cao Caoâs next move now that he has overcome Jingzhou?â
âHe is camped along the river, and he has collected a fleet. If he does not
intend to invade the South Land, what can his intentions be?â
âSince that is his intention, it is a case of fight or not fight. I wish you
would decide that for me.â
âI have something I could say, but I fear, Sir, you would not care to hear
it.â
âI am desirous of hearing your most valuable opinion.â
âStrife has prevailed for a long time; and so you have raised your army in
the South Land and Liu Bei collected his forces south of the Han River to act
in contest for the empire against Cao Cao. Now Cao Cao has overcome most of his
difficulties, and his recent conquest of Jingzhou has won him great and wide
renown. Though there might be one bold enough to tackle him, yet there is no
foothold for such. That is how Liu Bei has been forced to come here. But,
General, I wish you to measure your forces and decide whether you can venture
to meet Cao Cao and that without loss of time. If you cannot, then follow the
advice of your councilors: Cease your military preparations and yield, turn
your face to the north and serve.â
Sun Quan did not reply. But his guest went on, âYou have the reputation of
being reasonable, but I know also you are inclined to hesitate. Still this
matter is most important, and evil will be quickly upon you if you do not
decide.â
Then replied Sun Quan, âIf what you say represents the actual conditions, why
does not Liu Bei yield?â
âWell, you know Tian Heng, that hero of the state of Qi: His character was
too noble for him to submit to any shame. It is necessary to remember that Liu
Bei also is an off-shoot from the Dynastic Family, beside being a man of great
renown. Everyone looks up to him. His lack of success is simply the will of
Heaven, but manifestly he could not bow the knee to anyone.â
These last words touched Sun Quan to the quick, and he could not control his
anger. He shook out his sleeves, rose, and left the audience chamber. Those
present smiled at each other as they dispersed.
But Lu Su was annoyed and reproached Zhuge Liang for his maladroit way of
talking to Sun Quan, saying, âLuckily for you, my lord is too large-minded to
rebuke you to your face, for you spoke to him most contemptuously.â
Zhuge Liang threw back his head and laughed.
âWhat a sensitive fellow it is!â cried he. âI know how Cao Cao could be
destroyed, but he never asked me. So I said nothing.â
âIf you really do know how that could be done, I will certainly beg my lord
to ask you.â
âCao Caoâs hosts in my eyes are but as swarms of ants. I have but to lift
my hand, and they will be crushed,â said Zhuge Liang.
Lu Su at once went into his masterâs private room, where he found Sun Quan
still very irritable and angry.
âZhuge Liang insulted me too deeply,â said Sun Quan.
âI have already reproached him,â said Lu Su, âand he laughed and said you
were too sensitive. He would not give you any advice without being asked for
it. Why did you not seek advice from him, my lord?â
At once Sun Quanâs anger changed to joy.
He said, âSo he had a plan ready, and his words were meant to provoke me. I
did despise him for a moment, and it has very nearly lost me.â
So Sun Quan returned to the audience chamber where the guest was still seated
and begged Zhuge Liang to continue his speech.
Sun Quan spoke courteously, saying, âI offended you just now. I hope you are
not implacable.â
âAnd I also was rude,â replied Zhuge Liang. âI entreat pardon.â
Host and guest retired to the inner room where wine was served.
After it had gone round several times, Sun Quan said, âThe enemies of Cao Cao
were Lu Bu, Liu Biao, Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu, Liu Bei, and my poor self. Now most
of these are gone, and only Liu Bei and I remain. I will never allow the land
of Wu to be dictated to by another. The only one who could have withstood Cao
Cao was Liu Bei, but he has been defeated lately and what can he do now against
such force?â
Zhuge Liang replied, âAlthough defeated, Liu Bei still has Guan Yu with ten
thousand veterans. And Liu Qi still leads the troops of Jiangxia, another ten
thousand. Cao Caoâs army is far from home, and the soldiers are worn out.
They made a frantic effort to come up with my master, and the light horse
marched one hundred miles in a day and a night. This was the final kick of the
crossbow spring, and the bolt was not swift enough to penetrate even the thin
silken vesture of Lu. The army can do no more. They are northern people,
unskilled in water warfare, and the people of Jingzhou are unwilling
supporters. They have no desire to help Cao Cao. Now if you, General, will
assist Liu Bei, Cao Cao will certainly be broken, and he must retire
northwards. Then your country and Jingzhou will be strong, and the tripod will
be firmly established. But the scheme must be carried out without delay, and
only you can decide.â
Sun Quan joyfully replied, âYour words, Master, open up the road clearly. I
have decided and shall have no further doubts.â
So the orders were issued forthwith to prepare for a joint attack on Cao Cao.
And Sun Quan bade Lu Su bear the news of his decision to all his officers. He
himself escorted Zhuge Liang to the guest-quarters and saw to his comfort.
When Zhang Zhao heard of the decision he met his colleagues and said to them,
âOur master has fallen into the trap set by this Zhuge Liang.â
They went in a body to their lord and said, âWe hear you are going to attack
Cao Cao. But how do you stand when compared with Yuan Shao? In those days Cao
Cao was comparatively weak, and yet he overcame. What is he like today with his
countless legions? He is not to be lightly attacked, and to listen to Zhuge
Liangâs advice to engage in a conflict is like carrying fuel to a fire.â
Sun Quan made no reply, and Gu Yong took up the argument.
Gu Yong said, âLiu Bei has been defeated, and he wants to borrow our help to
beat his enemy. Why must our lord lend himself to his schemes? Pray listen to
our leaderâs words.â
Doubts again surged up in the mind of Sun Quan.
When the troop of advisers had retired, Lu Su came in, saying, âThey came to
exhort you not to fight, but to compel you to surrender. All this is simply
because they wish to secure the safety of their families. They distort their
sense of duty to serve their own ends, and I hope you will not take their
advice.â
Sun Quan being sunk in thought and saying nothing, Lu Su went on, âIf you
hesitate, you will certainly be led astray by the majority and ââ-â
âRetire for a time,â said his master. âI must think it over carefully.â
So Lu Su left the chamber. Among the soldiers some wished for war, but of the
civil officers, all were in favor of surrender; and so there were many
discussions and much conflict of opinion. Sun Quan went to his private
apartments greatly perplexed. There his worry was easily discernible, and he
neither ate nor slept. He was quite unable to decide finally upon a course of
action.
Then Lady Wu, the sister of his late mother, whom he also regarded as his own
mother, asked him what so troubled him, and he told her of the threatened
danger of Cao Cao and the different opinions his advisers held one and another
and all his doubts and fears.
âIf I fight, I might fail. But if I offer to surrender, perhaps Cao Cao will
not tolerate me,â said he.
Then she replied, âHave you forgotten the last words of my sister?â
As to one recovering from a fit of drunkenness, or waking out of a dream, so
came to him the dying words of the mother who bore him.
His motherâs advice he called to mind,
âIn Zhou Yuâs counsels you safety find.â
What happened will be told in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 44 ****
internal matters consult Zhang Zhao; for external policy Zhou Yu.â
Wherefore Zhou Yu was summoned.
But Zhou Yu was already on the way. He had been training his naval forces on
Poyang Lake when he heard of the approach of Cao Caoâs hosts and had started
for Chaisang without loss of time. So, before the messenger ordered to call him
could start, he had already arrived. As he and Lu Su were close friends, the
latter went to welcome him and told him of all that had happened.
âHave no anxiety,â said Zhou Yu. âI shall be able to decide this. But go
quickly and beg Zhuge Liang to come to see me.â
So Lu Su went to seek out Zhuge Liang.
Zhou Yu had many other visitors. First came Zhang Zhao, Zhang Hong, Gu Yong,
and Bu Zhi to represent their faction to find out what might be afoot.
They were received, and after the exchange of the usual commonplaces, Zhang
Zhao said, âHave you heard of our terrible danger?â
âI have heard nothing,â said Zhou Yu.
âCao Cao and his hordes are encamped up the Han River. He has just sent
letters asking our lord to hunt with him in Jiangxia. He may have a desire to
absorb this country but, if so, the details of his designs are still secret. We
prayed our master to give in his submission and so avoid the horrors of war,
but now Lu Su has returned bringing with him the Directing Instructor of Liu
Beiâs army, Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang, desiring to avenge himself for the
recent defeat, has talked our lord into a mind for war, and Lu Su persists in
supporting that policy. They only await your final decision.â
âAre you all unanimous in your opinions?â
âWe are perfectly unanimous,â said Zhang Zhao.
Zhou Yu said, âThe fact is I have also desired to submit for a long time. I
beg you to leave me now, and tomorrow we will see our master, and I shall make
up his mind for him.â
So they took their leave. Very soon came the military party led by Cheng Pu,
Huang Gai, and Han Dang. They were admitted and duly inquired after their
hostâs health.
Then the leader Cheng Pu said, âHave you heard that our country is about to
pass under anotherâs government?â
âNo, I have heard nothing,â replied the host.
âWe helped General Sun Quan to establish his authority here and carve out
this kingdom, and to gain that end we fought many a battle before we conquered
the country. Now our lord lends his ear to his civil officers and desires to
submit himself to Cao Cao. This is a most shameful and pitiful course, and we
would rather die than follow it. So we hope you will decide to fight, and you
may depend upon our struggling to the last person.â
âAnd are you unanimous, Generals?â asked Zhou Yu.
Huang Gai suddenly started up and smote his forehead, saying, âThey may take
my head, but I swear never to surrender.â
âNot one of us is willing to surrender,â cried all the others.
âMy desire also is to decide matters with Cao Cao on the battlefield. How
could we think of submission? Now I pray you retire, Generals, and when I see
our lord, I will settle his doubts.â
So the war party left. They were quickly succeeded by Zhuge Jin, Lu Fan, and
their faction.
They were brought in and, after the usual courtesies, Zhuge Jin said, âMy
brother has come down the river saying that Liu Bei desires to ally himself
with our lord against Cao Cao. The civil and military hold different opinions
as to the course to be pursued. But as my brother is so deeply concerned, I am
unwilling to say much on either side. We are awaiting your decision.â
âAnd what do you think about it?â asked Zhou Yu.
âSubmission is an easy road to tranquillity, while the result of war is hard
to foretell.â
Zhou Yu smiled, âI shall have my mind made up. Come tomorrow to the palace,
and the decision shall be announced.â
The trimmers took their leave. But soon after came Lu Meng, Gan Ning, and their
supporters, also desirous of discussing the same thing, and they told him that
opinions differed greatly, some being for peace and others for war. One party
constantly disputed with the other.
âI must not say much now,â replied Zhou Yu, âbut you will see tomorrow in
the palace, when the matter will be fully debated.â
They went away leaving Zhou Yu smiling cynically.
About eventide Lu Su and Zhuge Liang came, and Zhou Yu went out to the main
gate to receive them.
When they had taken their proper seats, Lu Su spoke first, saying, âCao Cao
has come against the South Land with a huge army. Our master cannot decide
whether to submit or give battle and waits for your decision. What is your
opinion?â
Zhou Yu replied, âWe may not oppose Cao Cao when he acts at the command of
the Emperor. Moreover, he is very strong, and to attack him is to take serious
risks. In my opinion, opposition would mean defeat and, since submission means
peace, I have decided to advise our lord to write and offer surrender.â
âBut you are wrong!â stammered Lu Su. âThis country has been under the
same rule for three generations and cannot be suddenly abandoned to some other.
Our late lord Sun Ce said that you were to be consulted on matters beyond the
border, and we depended upon you to keep the country as secure and solid as the
Taishan Mountains. Now you adopt the view of the weaklings and propose to
yield! I cannot believe you mean it.â
Replied Zhou Yu, âThe six territories contain countless people. If I am the
means of bringing upon them the misery of war, they will hate me. So I have
decided to advise submission.â
âBut do you not realize our lordâs might and the strength of our country?
If Cao Cao does attack, it is very uncertain that he will realize his
desire.â
The two wrangled for a long time, while Zhuge Liang sat smiling with folded
arms.
Presently Zhou Yu asked, âWhy do you smile thus, Master?â
And Zhuge Liang replied, âI am smiling at no other than your opponent Lu Su,
who knows nothing of the affairs of the day.â
âMaster,â said Lu Su, âwhat do you mean?â
âWhy, this intention to submit is perfectly reasonable. It is the one proper
thing.â
âThere!â exclaimed Zhou Yu. âZhuge Liang knows the times perfectly well,
and he agrees with me.â
âBut, both of you, why do you say this?â said Lu Su.
Said Zhuge Liang, âCao Cao is an excellent commander, so good that no one
dares oppose him. Only very few have ever attempted it, and they have been
exterminated â-the world knows them no more. The only exception is Liu Bei,
who did not understand the conditions and vigorously contended against him,
with the result that he is now at Jiangxia in a very parlous state. To submit
is to secure the safety of wives and children, to be rich and honored. But the
dignity of the country would be left to chance and fate â-however, that is
not worth consideration.â
Lu Su interrupted angrily, âWould you make our lord crook the knee to such a
rebel as Cao Cao?â
âWell,â replied Zhuge Liang, âthere is another way, and a cheaper. There
would be no need to âlead the sheep and shoulder wine potsâ for presents,
nor any need to yield territory and surrender seals of office. It would not
even be necessary to cross the river yourselves. All you would require is a
simple messenger and a little boat to ferry a couple of persons across the
river. If Cao Cao only got these two under his hand, his hordes and legions
would just drop their weapons, furl their banners, and silently vanish away.â
âWhat two persons could cause Cao Cao to go away as you say?â asked Zhou
Yu.
âTwo persons who could be easily spared from this populous country. They
would not be missed any more than a leaf from a tree or a grain of millet from
a granary. But if Cao Cao could only get them, would he not go away
rejoicing?â
âBut who are the two?â asked Zhou Yu again.
âWhen I was living in the country, they told me that Cao Cao was building a
pavilion on the River Zhang. It was to be named the Bronze Bird Tower. It is an
exceedingly handsome building, and he has sought throughout all the world for
the most beautiful women to live in it. For Cao Cao really is a sensualist.
âNow there are two very famous beauties in Wu, born of the Qiao family. So
beautiful are they that birds alight and fishes drown, the moon hides her face
and the flowers blush for shame at sight of them. Cao Cao has declared with an
oath that he only wants two things in this world: The imperial throne in peace
and the sight of those two women on the Bronze Bird Terraces. Given these two,
he would go down to his grave without regret. This expedition of his, his huge
army that threatens this country, has for its real aim these two women. Why do
you not buy these two from their father, the State Patriarch Qiao, for any sum
however large and send them over the river? The object of the army being
attained, it will simply be marched away. This is the ruse that Fan Li of Yue
made to the king of Wu of the famous beauty Xi Shi.â
âHow do you know Cao Cao so greatly desires these two?â said Zhou Yu.
âBecause his son Cao Zhi, who is an able writer, at the command of his father
wrote a poem âAn Ode to the Bronze Bird Terrace,â theme only allowing
allusions to the family fitness for the throne. He has sworn to possess these
two women. I think I can remember the poem, if you wish to hear it. I admire it
greatly.â
âTry,â said Zhou Yu.
So Zhuge Liang recited the poem:
âLet me follow in the footsteps of the enlightened ruler that I may rejoice,
And ascend the storied terrace that I may gladden my heart,
That I may see the wide extent of the palace,
That I may gaze upon the plans of the virtuous one.
He has established the exalted gates high as the hills,
He has built the lofty towers piercing the blue vault,
He has set up the beautiful building in the midst of the heavens,
Whence the eye can range over the cities of the west.
On the banks of the rolling River Zhang he planned it,
Whence abundance of fruits could be looked for in his gardens.
The two towers rise, one on either flank,
This named Golden Phoenix, that Jade Dragon.
He would have the two Qiaos, these beautiful ladies of Wu,
That he might rejoice with them morning and evening.
Look down; there is the grand beauty of an imperial city,
And the rolling vapors lie floating beneath.
He will rejoice in the multitude of scholars that assemble,
Answering to the felicitous dream of King Wen.
Look up; and there is the gorgeous harmony of springtime,
And the singing of many birds delighting the ear;
The lofty sky stands over all.
The house desires success in its double undertaking,
That the humane influence may be poured out over all the world,
That the perfection of reverence may be offered to the Ruler.
Only the richly prosperous rule of Kings Wu and Huan
Could compare with that of the sacred understanding
That fortune! What beauty!
The gracious kindness spreads afar,
The imperial family is supported,
Peace reigns over all the empire,
Bounded only by the universe.
Bright as the glory of the sun and moon,
Ever honorable and ever enduring,
The Ruler shall live to the age of the eastern emperor,
The dragon banner shall wave to the farthest limit.
His glorious chariot shall be guided with perfect wisdom,
His thoughts shall reform all the world,
Felicitous produce shall be abundant,
And the people shall rest firm.
My desire is that these towers shall endure forever,
And that joy shall never cease through all the ages.
Zhou Yu listened to the end but then suddenly jumped up in a tremendous rage.
Turning to the north and pointing with his finger, he cried, âYou old rebel,
this insult is too deep!â
Zhuge Liang hastily rose too and soothed him, saying, âBut remember the Khan
of the Xiongnu People. The Han emperor gave him a princess of the family to
wife although he had made many incursions into our territory. That was the
price of peace. You surely would not grudge two more women from among the
common people.â
âYou do not know, Sir,â replied Zhou Yu. âOf those two women of the Qiao
family you mentioned, Elder Qiao is the widow of Sun Ce, our late ruler, and
Younger Qiao is my wife!â
Zhuge Liang feigned the greatest astonishment and said, âNo indeed: I did not
know. I blundered â-a deadly fault â-a deadly fault!â
âOne of us two has to go: Either the old rebel or I. We shall not both live.
I swear that!â cried Zhou Yu.
âHowever, such a matter needs a good deal of thought,â replied Zhuge Liang.
âWe must not make any mistake.â
Zhou Yu replied, âI hold a sacred trust from my late lord, Sun Ce. I would
not bow the knee to any such as Cao Cao. What I said just now was to see how
you stood. I left Poyang Lake with the intention of attacking the north, and
nothing can change that intention, not even the sword at my breast or the ax on
my neck. But I trust you will lend an arm, and we will smite Cao Cao
together.â
âShould I be happy enough not to be rejected, I would render such humble
service as I could. Perhaps presently I might be able to offer a plan to oppose
him.â
âI am going to see my lord tomorrow to discuss this matter,â said Zhou Yu.
Zhuge Liang and Lu Su then left.
Next day at dawn Sun Quan went to the council chamber, where his officials,
civil and military, were already assembled. They numbered about sixty in all.
The civil, with Zhang Zhao at their head, were on the right; the military, with
Cheng Pu as their leader, were ranged on the left. All were in full ceremonial
dress, and the swords of the soldiers clanked on the pavement.
Soon Zhou Yu entered.
When Sun Quan had finished the usual gracious remarks, Zhou Yu said, âI hear
that Cao Cao is encamped on the river and has sent a dispatch to you, my lord.
I would ask what your opinion is.â
Thereupon the dispatch was produced and handed to Zhou Yu.
After reading it through he said, smiling, âThe old thief thinks there are no
people in this land that he writes in this contemptuous strain.â
âWhat do you think, Sir?â asked Sun Quan.
âHave you discussed this with the officials?â asked Zhou Yu.
âWe have been discussing this for days. Some counsel surrender and some
advise fight. I am undecided, and therefore I have asked you to come and decide
the point.â
âWho advise surrender?â asked Zhou Yu.
âZhang Zhao and his party are firmly set in this opinion.â
Zhou Yu then turned to Zhang Zhao and said, âI should be pleased to hear why
you are for surrender, Master.â
Then Zhang Zhao replied, âCao Cao has been attacking all opponents in the
name of the Emperor, who is entirely in his hands. He does everything in the
name of the government. Lately he has taken Jingzhou and thereby increased his
prestige. Our defense against him was the Great River, but now he also has a
large fleet and can attack by water. How can we withstand him? Wherefore I
counsel submission till some chance shall offer.â
âThis is but the opinion of an ill-advised student,â said Zhou Yu. âHow
can you think of abandoning this country that we have held for three
generations?â
âThat being so,â said Sun Quan, âwhere is a plan to come from?â
âThough Cao Cao assumes the name of the Prime Minister of the empire, he is
at heart a rebel. You, O General, are able in war and brave. You are the heir
to your father and brother. You command brave and tried soldiers, and you have
plentiful supplies. You are able to overrun the whole country and rid it of
every evil. There is no reason why you should surrender to a rebel.
âMoreover, Cao Cao has undertaken this expedition in defiance of all the
rules of war. The north is unsubdued. Ma Teng and Han Sui threaten his rear,
and yet he persists in his southern march. This is the first point against Cao
Cao. The northern soldiers are unused to fighting on the water. Cao Cao is
relinquishing his well-tried cavalry and trusting to ships. That is the second
point against him. Again, we are now in full winter and the weather is at its
coldest so there is no food for the horses. That is the third point against.
Soldiers from the central state marching in a wet country among lakes and
rivers will find themselves in an unaccustomed climate and suffer from malaria.
That is the fourth point against. Now when Cao Caoâs armies have all these
points against them, defeat is certain, however numerous they may be, and you
can take Cao Cao captive just as soon as you wish. Give me a few legions of
veterans, and I will go and destroy him.â
Sun Quan started up from his place, saying, âThe rebellious old rascal has
been wanting to overthrow the Hans and set up himself for years. He has rid
himself of all those he feared, save only myself, and I swear that one of us
two shall go now. Both of us cannot live. What you say, noble friend, is just
what I think, and Heaven has certainly sent you to my assistance.â
âThy servant will fight a decisive battle,â said Zhou Yu, âand shrink not
from any sacrifice. Only, General, do not hesitate.â
Sun Quan drew the sword that hung at his side and slashed off a corner of the
table in front of him, exclaiming, âLet any other person mention surrender,
and he shall be served as I have served this table!â
Then he handed the sword to Zhou Yu, at the same time giving him a commission
as Commander-in-Chief and Supreme Admiral, Cheng Pu being Vice-Admiral. Lu Su
was also nominated as Assistant Commander.
In conclusion Sun Quan said, âWith this sword you will slay any officer who
may disobey your commands.â
Zhou Yu took the sword and turning to the assembly said, âYou have heard our
lordâs charge to me to lead you to destroy Cao Cao. You will all assemble
tomorrow at the riverside camp to receive my orders. Should any be late or
fail, then the full rigor of military law â-the seven prohibitions and the
fifty-four capital penalties â-there provided, will be enforced.â
Zhou Yu took leave of Sun Quan and left the chamber. The various officers also
went their several ways.
When Zhou Yu reached his own place, he sent for Zhuge Liang to consult over the
business in hand. He told Zhuge Liang of the decision that had been taken and
asked for a plan of campaign.
âBut your master has not yet made up his mind,â said Zhuge Liang. âTill
he has, no plan can be decided upon.â
âWhat do you mean?â
âIn his heart, Sun Quan is still fearful of Cao Caoâs numbers and frets
over the inequality of the two armies. You will have to explain away those
numbers and bring him to a final decision before anything can be effected.â
âWhat you say is excellent,â said Zhou Yu, and he went to the palace that
night to see his master.
Sun Quan said, âYou must have something of real importance to say if you come
like this at night.â
Zhou Yu said, âI am making my dispositions tomorrow. You have quite made up
your mind?â
âThe fact is,â said Sun Quan, âI still feel nervous about the disparity
of numbers. Surely we are too few. That is really all I feel doubtful about.â
âIt is precisely because you have this one remaining doubt that I am come.
And I will explain. Cao Caoâs letter speaks of a million of marines, and so
you feel doubts and fears and do not wait to consider the real truth. Let us
examine the case thoroughly. We find that he has of central regionsâ
soldiers, say, some one hundred fifty thousand troops, and many of them are
sick. He only got seventy or eighty thousand northern soldiers from Yuan Shao,
and many of those are of doubtful loyalty. Now these sick men and these men of
doubtful loyalty seem a great many, but they are not at all fearsome. I could
smash them with fifty thousand soldiers. You, my lord, have no further
anxiety.â
Sun Quan patted his general on the back, saying, âYou have explained my
difficulty and relieved my doubts. Zhang Zhao is a fool who constantly bars my
expeditions. Only you and Lu Su have any real understanding of my heart.
Tomorrow you and Lu Su and Cheng Pu will start, and I shall have a strong
reserve ready with plentiful supplies to support you. If difficulties arise,
you can at once send for me, and I will engage with my own army.â
Zhou Yu left. But in his innermost heart, he said to himself, âIf that Zhuge
Liang can gauge my masterâs thoughts so very accurately, he is too clever for
me and will be a danger. He will have to be put out of the way.â
Zhou Yu sent a messenger over to Lu Su to talk over this last scheme. When he
had laid it bare, Lu Su did not favor it.
âNo, no,â said Lu Su, âit is self-destruction to make away with your
ablest officer before Cao Cao shall have been destroyed.â
âBut Zhuge Liang will certainly help Liu Bei to our disadvantage.â
âTry what his brother Zhuge Jin can do to persuade him. It would be an
excellent thing to have these two in our service.â
âYes, indeed,â replied Zhou Yu.
Next morning at dawn, Zhou Yu went to his camp and took his seat in the council
tent. The armed guards took up their stations right and left, and the officers
ranged themselves in lines to listen to the orders.
Now Cheng Pu, who was older than Zhou Yu but was made second in command, was
very angry at being passed over, so he made a pretense of indisposition and
stayed away from this assembly. But he sent his eldest son, Cheng Zi, to
represent him.
Zhou Yu addressed the gathering, saying, âThe law knows no partiality, and
you will all have to attend to your several duties. Cao Cao is now more
absolute than ever was Dong Zhuo, and the Emperor is really a prisoner in
Xuchang, guarded by the most cruel soldiers. We have a command to destroy Cao
Cao, and with your willing help we shall advance. The army must cause no
hardship to the people anywhere. Rewards for good service and punishments for
faults shall be given impartially.â
Having delivered this charge, Zhou Yu told off Han Dang and Huang Gai as
Leaders of the Van, and ordered the ships under their own command to get under
way and go to the Three Gorges. They would get orders by and bye. Then he
appointed four armies with two leaders over each: The first body was under
Jiang Qin and Zhou Tai; the second, Pan Zhang and Ling Tong; the third, Taishi
Ci and Lu Meng; the fourth, Lu Xun and Dong Xi. Lu Fan and Zhu Zhi were
appointed inspectors, to move from place to place and keep the various units up
to their work and acting with due regard to the general plan. Land and marine
forces were to move simultaneously. The expedition would soon start.
Having received their orders, each returned to his command and busied himself
in preparation. Cheng Zi, the son of Cheng Pu, returned and told his father
what arrangements had been made, and Cheng Pu was amazed at Zhou Yuâs skill.
Said he, âI have always despised Zhou Yu as a mere student who would never be
a general, but this shows that he has a leaderâs talent. I must support
him.â
So Cheng Pu went over to the quarters of the Commander-in-Chief and confessed
his fault. He was received kindly and all was over.
Next Zhou Yu sent for Zhuge Jin and said to him, âEvidently your brother is a
genius, a man born to be a kingâs counselor. Why then does he serve Liu Bei?
Now that he is here, I wish you to use every effort to persuade him to stay
with us. Thus our lord would gain able support and you two brothers would be
together, which would be pleasant for you both. I wish you success.â
Zhuge Jin replied, âI am ashamed of the little service I have rendered since
I came here, and I can do no other than obey your command to the best of my
ability.â
Thereupon he went away to his brother, whom he found in the guest-house. The
younger brother received him; and when he had reached the inner rooms, Zhuge
Liang bowed respectfully and, weeping, told his experiences since they parted
and his sorrow at their separation.
Then Zhuge Jin, weeping also, said, âBrother, do you remember the story of Bo
Yi and Shu Qi, the brothers who would not be separated?â
âAh, Zhou Yu has sent him to talk me over,â thought Zhuge Liang. So he
replied, âThey were two of the noble people of old days. Yes, I know.â
âThose two, although they perished of hunger near the Shouyang Hills, yet
never separated. You and I, born of the same mother and suckled at the same
breast, yet serve different masters and never meet. Are you not ashamed when
you think of such examples as Bo Yi and Shu Qi?â
Zhuge Liang replied, âYou are talking now of love, but what I stand for is
duty. We are both men of Han, and Liu Bei is of the family. If you, brother,
could leave the South Land and join me in serving the rightful branch, then on
the one side we should be honored as Ministers of Han, and on the other we
should be together as people of the same flesh and blood should be. Thus love
and duty would both receive their proper meed. What do you think of it, my
brother?â
âI came to persuade him and lo! It is I who is being talked over,â thought
Zhuge Jin.
He had no fitting reply to make, so he rose and took his leave. Returning to
Zhou Yu, he related the story of the interview.
âWhat do you think?â asked Zhou Yu.
âGeneral Sun Quan has treated me with great kindness, and I could not turn my
back on him,â replied Zhuge Jin.
âSince you decide to remain loyal, there is no need to say much. I think I
have a plan to win over your brother.â
The wisest people see eye to eye,
For each but sees the right;
But should their several interests clash,
They all the fiercer fight.
The means by which Zhou Yu tried to get the support of Zhuge Liang will be
described in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 45 ****
Zhou Yu was very annoyed by the words of Zhuge Jin, and a fierce hatred for
Zhuge Liang took root in his heart. He nourished a secret resolve to make away
with Zhuge Liang. He continued his preparations for war, and when the troops
were all mustered and ready, he went in for a farewell interview with his lord.
âYou go on first, Noble Sir,â said Sun Quan. âI will then march to
support you.â
Zhou Yu took his leave and then, with Cheng Pu and Lu Su, marched out with the
army. He invited Zhuge Liang to accompany the expedition, and when Zhuge Liang
cheerfully accepted, the four embarked in the same ship. They set sail, and the
fleet made for Xiakou.
About twenty miles from Three Gorges the fleet anchored near the shore, and
Zhou Yu built a stockade on the bank near the middle of their line with the
Western Hills as a support. Other camps were made near his. Zhuge Liang,
however, took up his quarters in a small ship.
When the camp dispositions were complete, Zhou Yu sent to request Zhuge Liang
to come and give him advice. Zhuge Liang came.
After the salutations were ended, Zhou Yu said, âCao Cao, though he had fewer
troops than Yuan Shao, nevertheless overcame Yuan Shao because he followed the
advice given by Xun You to destroy Yuan Shaoâs supplies at Wuchao. Now Cao
Cao has over eight hundred thousand troops while I have but fifty or sixty
thousand. In order to defeat him, his supplies must be destroyed first. I have
found out that the main depot is at the Iron Pile Mountains. As you have lived
hereabout, you know the topography quite well, and I wish to entrust the task
of cutting off supplies to you and your colleagues Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhao
Zilong. I will assist you with a thousand soldiers. I wish you to start without
delay. In this way we can best serve our masters.â
Zhuge Liang saw through this at once. He thought to himself, âThis is a ruse
in revenge for my not having been persuaded to enter the service of the South
Land. If I refuse, I shall be laughed at. So I will do as he asks and trust to
find some means of deliverance from the evil he intends.â
Therefore Zhuge Liang accepted the task with alacrity, much to the joy of Zhou
Yu.
After the leader of the expedition had taken his leave, Lu Su went to Zhou Yu
secretly and said, âWhy have you set him this task?â
âBecause I wish to compass his death without appearing ridiculous. I hope to
get him killed by the hand of Cao Cao and prevent his doing further
mischief.â
Lu Su left and went to see Zhuge Liang to find out if he suspected anything. Lu
Su found him looking quite unconcerned and getting the soldiers ready to march.
Unable to let Zhuge Liang go without a warning, however, Lu Su put a tentative
question, âDo you think this expedition will succeed?â
Zhuge Liang laughingly replied, âI am an adept at all sorts of fighting, with
foot, horse, and chariots on land and marines on the water. There is no doubt
of my success. I am not like you and your friend, only capable in one
direction.â
âWhat do you mean by our being capable only in one direction?â said Lu Su.
âI have heard the street children in your country singing:
âTo lay an ambush, hold a pass,
Lu Su is the man to choose;
But when you on the water fight,
Zhou Yu is the man to use.
âYou are only fit for ambushes and guarding passes on land, just as Zhou Yu
only understands fighting on the water,â said Zhuge Liang.
Lu Su carried this story to Zhou Yu, which only incensed him the more against
Zhuge Liang.
âHow dare he flout me, saying I cannot fight a land battle? I will not let
him go. I will go myself with ten thousand troops and cut off Cao Caoâs
supplies.â
Lu Su went back and told this to Zhuge Liang, who smiled and said, âZhou Yu
only wanted me to go on this expedition because he wanted Cao Cao to kill me.
And so I teased him a little. But he cannot bear that. Now is the critical
moment, and Marquis Sun Quan and my master must act in harmony if we are to
succeed. If each one tries to harm the other, the whole scheme will fail. Cao
Cao is no fool, and it is he who usually attack enemies through cutting off
their supplies. Do you not think Cao Cao has already taken double precautions
against any surprise of his own depot? If Zhou Yu tries, he will be taken
prisoner. What he ought to do is to bring about a decisive naval battle,
whereby to dishearten the northern soldiers, and then find some other means to
defeat them utterly. If you could persuade him what his best course was, it
would be well.â
Without loss of time, Lu Su went to Zhou Yu to relate what Zhuge Liang had told
him.
Zhou Yu shook his head when he heard it and beat the ground with his foot,
saying, âThis man is far too clever. He beats me ten to one. He will have to
be done away with, or the South Land will suffer.â
Said Lu Su, âThis is the moment to use people. You must think of the
countryâs good first of all. When once Cao Cao is defeated, you may do as you
please.â
Zhou Yu had to confess the reasonableness of this.
Liu Bei had ordered his nephew Liu Qi to hold Jiangxia, while he and the bulk
of the army returned to Xiakou. Thence he saw the opposite bank thick with
banners and flags and glittering with every kind of arms and armors. He knew
then that the expedition from the South Land had started. So he moved all his
force from Jiangxia to Fankou.
Then he assembled his officers and said to them, âZhuge Liang went to Wu some
time ago, and no word has come from him, so I know not how the business stands.
Will anyone volunteer to go to find out?â
âI will go,â said Mi Zhu.
So presents were prepared and gifts of flesh and wine, and Mi Zhu prepared to
journey to the South Land on the pretext of offering a congratulatory feast to
the army. He set out in a small ship and went down river. He stopped opposite
the camp, and the soldiers reported his arrival to Zhou Yu, who ordered him to
be brought in. Mi Zhu bowed low and expressed the respect which Liu Bei had for
Zhou Yu and offered the various gifts. The ceremony of reception was followed
by a banquet in honor of the guest.
Mi Zhu said, âZhuge Liang has been here a long time, and I desire that he may
return with me.â
âZhuge Liang is making plans with me, and I could not let him return,â said
Zhou Yu. âI also wish to see Liu Bei that we may make joint plans. But when
one is at the head of a great army, one cannot get away even for a moment. If
your master would only come here, it would be very gracious on his part.â
Mi Zhu agreed that Liu Bei might come and presently took his leave.
Then Lu Su asked Zhou Yu, âWhat is your reason for desiring Liu Bei to
come?â
âLiu Bei is the one bold and dangerous man and must be removed. I am taking
this opportunity to persuade him to come. When he shall be slain, a great
danger will cease to threaten our interests.â
Lu Su tried to dissuade him from this scheme, but Zhou Yu was deaf to all Lu Su
said.
Zhou Yu even issued orders: âArrange half a hundred executioners to be ready
to hide within the lining of the tent if Liu Bei decides to come; and when I
drop a cup, that will be a signal for them to fall on and slay him.â
Mi Zhu returned and told Liu Bei that his presence was desired by Zhou Yu.
Suspecting nothing, Liu Bei at once ordered them to prepare a fast vessel to
take him without loss of time.
Guan Yu was opposed to his going, saying, âZhou Yu is artful and treacherous,
and there is no news from Zhuge Liang. Pray think more carefully.â
Liu Bei replied, âI have joined my forces to theirs in this attack on our
common enemy. If Zhou Yu wishes to see me and I refuse to go, it is a betrayal.
Nothing will succeed if both sides nourish suspicions.â
âIf you have finally decided to go, then will I go with you,â said Guan Yu.
âAnd I also,â cried Zhang Fei.
But Liu Bei said, âLet Guan Yu come with me while you and Zhao Zilong keep
guard. Jian Yong will hold Exian. I shall not be away long.â
So leaving these orders, Liu Bei embarked with Guan Yu on a small boat. The
escort did not exceed twenty. The light craft traveled very quickly down the
river. Liu Bei rejoiced greatly at the sight of the war vessels in tiers by the
bank, the soldiers in their breastplates, and all the pomp and panoply of war.
All was in excellent order.
As soon as he arrived, the guards ran to tell Zhou Yu.
âHow many ships has he?â asked Zhou Yu.
They replied, âOnly one; and the escort is only about a score.â
âHis fate is sealed,â said Zhou Yu.
Zhou Yu sent for the executioners and placed them in hiding between the outer
and inner tents, and when all was arranged for the assassination he
contemplated, he went out to receive his visitor. Liu Bei came with his brother
and escort into the midst of the army to the Admiralâs tent.
After the salutations, Zhou Yu wished Liu Bei to take the upper seat, but he
declined saying, âGeneral, you are famous throughout all the empire, while I
am a nobody. Do not overwhelm me with too great deference.â
So they took the positions of simple friends, and refreshments were brought in.
Now by chance Zhuge Liang came on shore and heard that his master had arrived
and was with the Commander-in-Chief. The news gave Zhuge Liang a great shock,
and he said to himself, âWhat is to be done now?â
He made his way to the reception tent and stole a look therein. He saw murder
written on Zhou Yuâs countenance and noted the assassins hidden within the
walls of the tent. Then he got a look at Liu Bei, who was laughing and talking
quite unconcernedly. But when he noticed the redoubtable figure of Guan Yu near
his masterâs side, he became quite calm and contented.
âMy lord faces no danger,â said Zhuge Liang, and he went away to the river
bank to await the end of the interview.
Meanwhile the banquet of welcome proceeded. After the wine had gone around
several times, Zhou Yu picked up a cup to give the signal agreed upon. But at
that moment Zhou Yu saw so fierce a look upon the face of the trusty henchman
who stood, sword in hand, behind his guest, that Zhou Yu hesitated and hastily
asked who he was.
âThat is my brother, Guan Yu,â replied Liu Bei.
Zhou Yu, quite startled, said, âIs he the slayer of Yan Liang and Wen
Chou?â
âExactly; he it is,â replied Liu Bei.
The sweat of fear broke out all over Zhou Yuâs body and trickled down his
back. Then he poured out a cup of wine and presented it to Guan Yu.
Just then Lu Su came in, and Liu Bei said to him, âWhere is Zhuge Liang? I
would trouble you to ask him to come.â
âWait till we have defeated Cao Cao,â said Zhou Yu, âthen you shall see
him.â
Liu Bei dared not repeat his request, but Guan Yu gave him a meaningful look
which Liu Bei understood and rose, saying, âI would take leave now. I will
come again to congratulate you when the enemy has been defeated and your
success shall be complete.â
Zhou Yu did not press him to remain, but escorted him to the great gates of the
camp, and Liu Bei left. When he reached the river bank, they found Zhuge Liang
awaiting them in their boat.
Liu Bei was exceedingly pleased, but Zhuge Liang said, âSir, do you know in
how great danger you were today?â
Suddenly sobered, Liu Bei said, âNo, I did not think of danger.â
âIf Guan Yu had not been there, you would have been killed,â said Zhuge
Liang.
Liu Bei, after a momentâs reflection, saw that it was true. He begged Zhuge
Liang to return with him to Fankou, but Zhuge Liang refused.
âI am quite safe,â said Zhuge Liang. âAlthough I am living in the
tigerâs mouth, I am as steady as the Taishan Mountains. Now, my lord, return
and prepare your ships and soldiers. On the twentieth day of the eleventh
month, send Zhao Zilong with a small ship to the south bank to wait for me. Be
sure there is no miscarriage.â
âWhat are your intentions?â said Liu Bei.
âWhen the southeast wind begins, I shall return.â
Liu Bei would have questioned him further, but Zhuge Liang pressed him to go.
So the boat started up river again, while Zhuge Liang returned to his temporary
lodging.
The boat had not proceeded far when appeared a small fleet of fifty ships
sweeping down with the current, and in the prow of the leading vessel stood a
tall figure armed with a spear. Guan Yu was ready to fight. But when they were
near, they recognized that was Zhang Fei, who had come down fearing lest his
brother might be in some difficulty from which the strong arm of Guan Yu might
even be insufficient to rescue him.
The three brothers thus returned together.
After Zhou Yu, having escorted Liu Bei to the gate of his camp, had returned to
his quarters, Lu Su soon came to see him.
âThen you had cajoled Liu Bei into coming, why did you not carry out your
plan?â asked Lu Su.
âBecause of that Guan Yu. He is a very tiger, and he never left his brother
for a moment. If anything had been attempted, he would certainly have had my
life.â
Lu Su knew that Zhou Yu spoke the truth. Then suddenly they announced a
messenger with a letter from Cao Cao. Zhou Yu ordered them to bring him in and
took the letter. But when he saw the superscription The First Minister of Han
to Commander-in-Chief Zhou Yu, he fell into a frenzy of rage, tore the letter
to fragments, and threw them on the ground.
âTo death with this fellow!â cried he.
âWhen two countries are at war, their emissaries are not slain,â said Lu
Su.
âMessengers are slain to show oneâs dignity and independence,â replied
Zhou Yu.
The unhappy bearer of the letter was decapitated, and his head sent back to Cao
Cao by the hands of his escort.
Zhou Yu then decided to move. The van under Gan Ning was to advance, supported
by two wings led by Han Dang and Jiang Qin. Zhou Yu would lead the center body
in support. The next morning the early meal was eaten in the fourth watch, and
the ships got under way in the fifth with a great beating of drums.
Cao Cao was greatly angered when he heard that his letter had been torn to
fragments, and he resolved to attack forthwith. His advance was led by the
Supreme Admiral Cai Mao, the Vice-Admiral Zhang Yun, and others of the Jingzhou
officers who had joined his side. Cao Cao went as hastily as possible to the
meeting of the three rivers and saw the ships of the South Land sailing up.
In the bow of the foremost ship from the south stood a fine figure of a
warrior, who cried, âI am Gan Ning. I challenge anyone to combat!â
Cai Mao sent his young brother, Cai Xun, to accept the challenge. But as Cai
Xunâs ship approached, Gan Ning shot an arrow and Cai Xun fell. Gan Ning
pressed forward, his crossbowmen keeping up a heavy discharge which Cao Caoâs
troops could not stand. The wings of Han Dang from the left and Jiang Qin from
the right also joined in.
Cao Caoâs soldiers, being mostly from the dry plains of the north, did not
know how to fight effectually on water, and the southern ships had the battle
all their own way. The slaughter was very great. However, after a contest
lasting till afternoon, Zhou Yu thought it more prudent, in view of the
superior numbers of his enemy, not to risk further the advantage he had gained.
So he beat the gongs as the signal to cease battle and recall the ships.
Cao Cao was worsted, but his ships returned to the bank, where a camp was made
and order was restored.
Cao Cao sent for his defeated leaders and reproached them, saying, âYou did
not do your best. You let an inferior force overcome you.â
Cai Mao defended himself, saying, âThe Jingzhou marines have not been
exercised for a long time, and the others have never been trained for naval
warfare at all. A naval camp must be instituted, the northern soldiers trained,
and the Jingzhou force drilled. When they have been made efficient, they will
win victories.â
âYou are the Supreme Admiral. If you know what should be done, why have you
not done it?â said Cao Cao. âWhat is the use of telling me this?â
So Cai Mao and Zhang Yun organized a naval camp on the river bank. They
established twenty-four âWater Gates,â with the large ships outside as a
sort of rampart, and under their protection the smaller ships went to and fro
freely. At night when the lanterns and torches were lit, the very sky was
illuminated, and the water shone red with the glare. On land the smoke of the
camp fires could be traced for one hundred mile without a break.
Zhou Yu returned to camp and feasted his victorious fighting force. A messenger
bore the joyful tidings of victory to his master Sun Quan. When night fell,
Zhou Yu went up to the summit of one of the hills and looked out over the long
line of bright lights stretching toward the west, showing the extent of the
enemyâs camp. He said nothing, but a great fear came in upon him.
Next day Zhou Yu decided that he would go in person to find out the strength of
the enemy. So he bade them prepare a small squadron which he manned with
strong, hardy men armed with powerful bows and stiff crossbows. He also placed
musicians on each ship. They set sail and started up the stream. When they got
opposite Cao Caoâs camp, the heavy stones that served as anchors were
dropped, and the music was played while Zhou Yu scanned the enemyâs naval
camp. What he saw gave him no satisfaction, for everything was most admirable.
He said, âHow well and correctly built is that naval base! Anyone knows the
names of those in command?â
âThey are Cai Mao and Zhang Yun,â said his officers.
âThey have lived in the south a long time,â said Zhou Yu, âand are
thoroughly experienced in naval warfare. I must find some means of removing
them before I can effect anything.â
Meanwhile on shore the sentinels had told Cao Cao that the enemy craft were
spying upon them, and Cao Cao ordered out some ships to capture the spies. Zhou
Yu saw the commotion of the commanding flags on shore and hastily gave the
order to unmoor and sail down stream. The squadron at once got under way and
scattered; to and fro went the oars, and each ship seemed to fly. Before Cao
Caoâs ships could get out after them, they were all far away.
Cao Caoâs ships took up the chase but soon saw pursuit was useless. They
returned and reported their failure.
Again Cao Cao found fault with his officers and said, âThe other day you lost
a battle, and the soldiers were greatly dispirited. Now the enemy have spied
out our camp. What can be done?â
In eager response to his question one stepped out, saying, âWhen I was a
youth, Zhou Yu and I were fellow students and pledged friends. My three-inch
tongue is still good, and I will go over and persuade him to surrender.â
Cao Cao, rejoiced to find so speedy a solution, looked at the speaker. It was
Jiang Gan of Jiujiang, one of the counseling staff in the camp.
âAre you a good friend of Zhou Yu?â said Cao Cao.
âRest content, O Prime Minister,â replied Jiang Gan. âIf I only get on
the other side of the river, I shall succeed.â
âWhat preparations are necessary?â asked Cao Cao.
âJust a youth as my servant and a couple of rowers. Nothing else.â
Cao Cao offered him wine, wished him success, and sent him on his way.
Clad in a simple linen robe and seated in his little craft, the messenger
reached Zhou Yuâs camp and bade the guards say that an old friend Jiang Gan
wished to see him.
The commander was in his tent at a council when the message came, and he
laughed as he said to those about him, âA persuader is coming.â
Then he whispered certain instructions in the ear of each one of them, and they
went out to await his arrival.
Zhou Yu received his friend in full ceremonial garb. A crowd of officers in
rich silken robes were about him. The guest appeared, his sole attendant a lad
dressed in a simple blue gown. Jiang Gan bore himself proudly as he advanced,
and Zhou Yu made a low obeisance.
âYou have been well I hope since last we met,â said Jiang Gan.
âYou have wandered far and suffered much in this task of emissary in Cao
Caoâs cause,â said Zhou Yu.
âI have not seen you for a very long time,â said the envoy much taken
aback, âand I came to visit you for the sake of old times. Why do you call me
an emissary for the Cao Caoâs cause?â
âThough I am not so profound a musician as Shi Kuang of old, yet I can
comprehend the thought behind the music,â replied Zhou Yu.
âAs you choose to treat your old friend like this, I think I will take my
leave,â said Jiang Gan.
Zhou Yu laughed again, and taking Jiang Gan by the arm, said, âWell, I feared
you might be coming on his behalf to try to persuade me. But if this is not
your intention, you need not go away so hastily.â
So they two entered the tent. When they had exchanged salutes and were seated
as friends, Zhou Yu bade them call his officers that he might introduce them.
They soon appeared civil and military officials, all dressed in their best. The
military officers were clad in glittering silver armor and the staff looked
very imposing as they stood ranged in two lines.
The visitor was introduced to them all. Presently a banquet was spread, and
while they feasted, the musicians played songs of victory and the wine
circulated merrily.
Under the mellowing influence, Zhou Yuâs reserve seemed to thaw and he said,
âJiang Gan is an old fellow student of mine, and we are pledged friends.
Though he has arrived here from the north, he is no artful pleader so you need
not be afraid of him.â
Then Zhou Yu took off the commanding sword which he wore as Commander-in-Chief
and handed it to Taishi Ci, saying, âYou take this and wear it for the day as
master of the feast. This day we meet only as friends and speak only of
friendship, and if anyone shall begin a discussion of the questions at issue
between Cao Cao and the South Land, just slay him.â
Taishi Ci took the sword and seated himself in his place. Jiang Gan was not a
little overcome, but he said no word.
Zhou Yu said, âSince I assumed command, I have tasted no drop of wine; but
today as an old friend is present and there is no reason to fear him, I am
going to drink freely.â
So saying he quaffed a huge goblet and laughed loudly.
The rhinoceros cups went swiftly round from guest to guest till all were half
drunk. Then Zhou Yu, laying hold of the guestâs hand, led him outside the
tent. The guards who stood around all braced themselves up and seized their
shinning weapons.
âDo you not think my soldiers a fine lot of fellows?â said Zhou Yu.
âStrong as bears and bold as tigers,â replied Jiang Gan.
Then Zhou Yu led him to the rear of the tent whence he saw the grain and forage
piled up in mountainous heaps.
âDo you not think I have a fairly good store of grain and forage?â
âYour troops are brave and your supplies ample: The empireâs gossip is not
baseless, indeed.â
Zhou Yu pretended to be quite intoxicated and went on, âWhen you and I were
students together, we never looked forward to a day like this, did we?â
âFor a genius like you, it is nothing extraordinary,â said the guest.
Zhou Yu again seized his hand, and they sat down.
âA man of the time, I have found a proper lord to serve. In his service, we
rely upon the right feeling between minister and prince outside, and at home we
are firm in the kindly feeling of relatives. He listens to my words and follows
my plans. We share the same good or evil fortune. Even when the great old
persuaders like Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Lu Jia, and Li Yiji lived again, even when
their words poured forth like a rushing river, their tongues were as a sharp
sword, it is impossible to move such as I am!â
Zhou Yu burst into a loud laugh as he finished, and Jiang Ganâs face had
become clay-colored. Zhou Yu then led his guest back into the tent, and again
they fell to drinking.
Presently Zhou Yu pointed to the others at table and said, âThese are all the
best and bravest of the land of the south. One might call this the âGathering
of Heroes.ââ
They drank on till daylight failed and continued after lamps had been lit. Zhou
Yu even gave an exhibition of sword play and sang this song:
When a man is in the world, O,
He ought to do his best.
And when heâs done his best, O.
He ought to have his rest.
And when I have my rest, O,
Iâll quaff my wine with zest.
And when Iâm drunk as drunk can be, O,
Iâll sing the madmanâs litany.
A burst of applause greeted the song. By this time it was getting late, and the
guest begged to be excused.
âThe wine is too much for me,â said Jiang Gan.
His host bade them clear the table.
As all the others left, Zhou Yu said, âIt has been many a day since I shared
a couch with my friend, but we will do so tonight.â
Putting on the appearance of irresponsible intoxication, he led Jiang Gan into
the tent and they went to bed. Zhou Yu simply fell, all dressed as he was, and
lay there emitting uncouth grunts and groans, so that to the guest sleep was
impossible.
Jiang Gan lay and listened to the various camp noises without and his hostâs
thunderous snores within. About the second watch he rose and looked at his
friend by the dim light of the small lamp. He also saw on the table a heap of
papers, and coming out and looking at them furtively, he saw they were letters.
Among them he saw one marked as coming from Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, Cao Caoâs
Supreme Admiral and Vice-Admiral. He read it and this is what it said:
âWe surrendered to Cao Cao, not for the sake of pay but under stress of
circumstances. Now we have been able to hold these northern soldiers into this
naval camp but, as soon as occasion offers, we mean to have the rebelâs head
to offer as a sacrifice to your banner. From time to time there will be reports
as occasions serve, but you may trust us. This is our humble reply to your
letter.â
âThose two were connected with the South Land in the beginning,â thought
Jiang Gan, so he secreted the letter in his dress and began to examine the
others. But at that moment Zhou Yu turned over, and so Jiang Gan hastily blew
out the light and went to his couch.
Zhou Yu was muttering as he lay there as if dreaming, saying, âFriend, I am
going to let you see Cao Caoâs head in a day or two.â
Jiang Gan hastily made some reply to load on his host to say more. Then came,
âWait a few days; you will see Cao Caoâs head. The old wretch!â
Jiang Gan tried to question him as to what he meant, but Zhou Yu was fast
asleep and seemed to hear nothing. Jiang Gan lay there on his couch wide awake
till the fourth watch was beating.
Then someone came in, saying, âGeneral, are you awake?â
At that moment as if suddenly awakened from the deepest slumber, Zhou Yu
started up and said, âWho is this on the couch?â
The voice replied, âDo you not remember, General? You asked your old friend
to stay the night with you. It is he, of course.â
âI drank too much last night,â said Zhou Yu in a regretful tone, âand I
forgot. I seldom indulge to excess and am not used to it. Perhaps I said many
things I ought not.â
The voice went on, âA man has arrived from the north.â
âSpeak lower,â said Zhou Yu, and turning toward the sleeper, he called him
by name. But Jiang Gan affected to be sound asleep and made no sign.
Zhou Yu crept out of the tent, while Jiang Gan listened with all his ears. He
heard the man say, âCai Mao and Zhang Yun, the two commanders, said that they
cannot execute the plan in a hurry.â
But listening as he did with straining ears, he could not make out what
followed. Soon after Zhou Yu reentered and again called out his companionâs
name. But no reply came, for Jiang Gan was pretending to be in the deepest
slumber and to hear nothing. Then Zhou Yu undressed and went to bed.
As Jiang Gan lay awake, he remembered that Zhou Yu was known to be meticulously
careful in affairs, and if in the morning Zhou Yu found that a letter had
disappeared, he would certainly slay the offender. So Jiang Gan lay there till
near daylight and then called out to his host. Getting no reply, he rose,
dressed, and stole out of the tent. Then he called his servant and made for the
camp gate.
âWhither are you going, Sir?â said the watchmen at the gate.
âI fear I am in the way here,â replied Jiang Gan, âand so I have taken
leave of the Commander-in-Chief for a time. So do not stop me.â
He found his way to the river bank and reembarked. Then, with flying oars, he
hastened back to Cao Caoâs camp. When he arrived, Cao Cao asked at once how
he had sped, and he had to acknowledge failure.
âZhou Yu is very clever and perfectly high-minded,â said Jiang Gan.
âNothing that I could say moved him in the least.â
âYour failure makes me look ridiculous,â said Cao Cao.
âWell, if I did not win over Zhou Yu, I found out something for you. Send
away these people, and I will tell you,â said Jiang Gan.
The servants were dismissed, and then Jiang Gan produced the letter he had
stolen from Zhou Yuâs tent. He gave it to Cao Cao. Cao Cao was very angry and
sent for Cai Mao and Zhang Yun at once.
As soon as they appeared, he said, âI want you two to attack.â
Cai Mao replied, âBut the soldiers are not yet sufficiently trained.â
âThe soldiers will be well enough trained when you have sent my head to Zhou
Yu, eh?â
Both commanders were dumb-founded, having not the least idea what this meant.
They remained silent for they had nothing to say. Cao Cao bade the executioners
lead them away to instant death. In a short time their heads were produced.
By this time Cao Cao had thought over the matter, and it dawned upon him that
he had been tricked. A poem says:
No one could stand against Cao Cao,
Of sin he had full share,
But Zhou Yu was more treacherous,
And caught him in a snare.
Two commanders to save their lives,
Betrayed a former lord,
Soon after, as was very met.
Both fell beneath the sword.
The death of these two naval commanders caused much consternation in the camp,
and all their colleagues asked the reason for their sudden execution. Though
Cao Cao knew they had been victimized, he would not acknowledge it.
So he said, âThese two had been remiss, and so had been put to death.â
The others were aghast, but nothing could be done. Two other officers, Mao Jie
and Yu Jin, were put in command of the naval camp.
Spies took the news to Zhou Yu, who was delighted at the success of his ruse.
âThose two Cai Mao and Zhang Yun were my only source of anxiety,â said he.
âNow they are gone: I am quite happy.â
Lu Su said, âGeneral, if you can continue like this, you need not fear Cao
Cao.â
âI do not think any of them saw my game,â said Zhou Yu, âexcept Zhuge
Liang. He beats me, and I do not think this ruse was hidden from him. You go
and sound him. See if he knew.â
Zhou Yuâs treacherous plot succeeded well,
Dissension sown, his rivals fell.
Drunk with success was he, but sought
To know what cynic Zhuge Liang thought.
What passed between Lu Su and Zhuge Liang will next be related.

**** Chapter 46 ****
Lu Su departed on his mission and found Zhuge Liang seated in his little craft.
âThere has been so much to do that I have not been able to come to listen to
your instructions,â said Lu Su.
âThat is truly so,â said Zhuge Liang, âand I have not yet congratulated
the Commander-in-Chief.â
âWhat have you wished to congratulate him upon?â
âWhy Sir, the matter upon which he sent you to find out whether I knew about
it or not. Indeed I can congratulate him on that.â
Lu Su turned pale and gasped, saying, âBut how did you know, Master?â
âThe ruse succeeded well thus played off on Jiang Gan. Cao Cao has been taken
in this once, but he will soon rise to it. Only he will not confess his
mistake. However, the two men are gone, and the South Land is freed from a
grave anxiety. Do you not think that is a matter for congratulation? I hear Mao
Jie and Yu Jin are the new admirals, and in their hands lie both good and evil
for the fate of the northern fleet.â
Lu Su was quite dumbfounded. He stayed a little time longer passing the time in
making empty remarks, and then took his leave.
As he was going away, Zhuge Liang cautioned him, saying, âDo not let Zhou Yu
know that I know his ruse. If you let him know, he will seek some chance to do
me harm.â
Lu Su promised. Nevertheless he went straight to his chief and related the
whole thing just as it happened.
âReally he must be got rid of,â said Zhou Yu. âI have quite decided to
put the man out of the way.â
âIf you slay him, will not Cao Cao laugh at you?â
âOh, no! I will find a legitimate way of getting rid of him so that he shall
go to his death without resentment.â
âBut how can you find a legitimate way of assassinating him?â
âDo not ask too much. You will see presently.â
Soon after all the officers were summoned to the main tent, and Zhuge Liangâs
presence was desired. He went contentedly enough.
When all were seated, Zhou Yu suddenly addressed Zhuge Liang, saying, âI am
going to fight a battle with the enemy soon on the water. What weapons are the
best?â
âOn a great river arrows are the best,â said Zhuge Liang.
âYour opinion and mine agree. But at the moment we are short of them. I wish
you would undertake to supply about a hundred thousand arrows for the naval
fight. As it is for the public service, you will not decline, I hope.â
âWhatever task the Commander-in-Chief lays upon me, I must certainly try to
perform,â replied Zhuge Liang. âMay I inquire by what date you require the
hundred thousand arrows?â
âCould you have them ready in ten days?â
âThe enemy will be here very soon. Ten days will be too late,â said Zhuge
Liang.
âIn how many days do you estimate the arrows can be ready?â
âLet me have three days. Then you may send for your hundred thousand.â
âNo joking, remember!â said Zhou Yu. âThere is no joking in war time.â
âDare I joke with the Commander-in-Chief? Give me a formal military order. If
I have not completed the task in three days, I will take my punishment.â
Zhou Yu, secretly delighted, sent for the secretaries and prepared the
commission then and there.
Then he drank to the success of the undertaking and said, âI shall have to
congratulate you most heartily when this is accomplished.â
âThis day is too late to count,â said Zhuge Liang. âOn the third from
tomorrow morning send five hundred soldiers to the river side to convey the
arrows.â
They drank a few more cups together, and then Zhuge Liang took his leave.
After he had gone, Lu Su said, âDo you not think there is some deceit about
this?â
âClearly it is not I! It is he who has signed his own death warrant,â said
Zhou Yu. âWithout being pressed in the least, he asked for a formal order in
the face of the whole assembly. Even if he grew a pair of wings, he could not
escape. Only I will just order the workers to delay him as much as they can,
and not supply him with materials, so that he is sure to fail. And then, when
the certain penalty is incurred, who can criticize? You can go and inquire
about it all and keep me informed.â
So off went Lu Su to seek Zhuge Liang, who at once reproached him with having
blabbed about the former business.
Zhuge Liang said, âHe wants to hurt me, as you know, and I did not think you
could not keep my secret. And now there is what you saw today, and how do you
think I can get a hundred thousand arrows made in three days? You will simply
have to rescue me.â
âYou brought the misfortune on yourself, and how can I rescue you?â said Lu
Su.
âI look to you for the loan of twenty vessels, manned each by thirty people.
I want blue cotton screens and bundles of straw lashed to the sides of the
boats. I have good use for them. On the third day, I shall undertake to deliver
the fixed number of arrows. But on no account must you let Zhou Yu know, or my
scheme will be wrecked.â
Lu Su consented, and this time he kept his word. He went to report to his chief
as usual, but he said nothing about the boats.
He only said, âZhuge Liang is not using bamboo or feathers or glue or
varnish, but has some other way of getting arrows.â
âLet us await the three daysâ limit,â said Zhou Yu, puzzled though
confident.
On his side Lu Su quietly prepared a score of light swift boats, each with its
crew and the blue screens and bundles of grass complete and, when these were
ready, he placed them at Zhuge Liangâs disposal.
Zhuge Liang did nothing on the first day, nor on the second. On the third day
at the middle of the fourth watch, Zhuge Liang sent a private message asking Lu
Su to come to his boat.
âWhy have you sent for me, Sir?â asked Lu Su.
âI want you to go with me to get those arrows.â
âWhither are you going?â
âDo not ask. You will see.â
Then the twenty boats were fastened together by long ropes and moved over to
the north bank. The night proved very foggy and the mist was very dense along
the river, so that one person could scarcely see another. In spite of the fog,
Zhuge Liang urged the boats forward as if into the vast fairy kingdom.
There is a poem on these river fogs:
Mighty indeed is the Great River!
Rising far in the west, in the Emei and Min Mountains,
Plowing its way through Wu, east flowing, resistless,
Swelled by its nine tributary streams, rolling down from the far north,
Aided and helped by a hundred rivulets swirling and foaming,
Ocean receives it at last welcoming, joyful, its waters.
Therein abide sea nymphs and water gods,
Enormous whales a thousand fathoms long,
Nine-headed monstrous beasts, reptiles and octopi,
Demons and uncouth creatures wondrous strange.
In faith it is the home and safe retreat
Of devils and sprites, and wondrous growths,
And eke the battle ground of valiant humans.
At times occur strange strife of elements,
When darkness strives on lightâs domains that encroach,
Whereat arises in the vaulted dome of blue
White wreaths of fog that toward the center roll.
Then darkness falls, too dense for any torch
Illumine; only clanging sounds can pass.
The fog at first appears, a vaporous wreath
Scarce visible. But thickening fast, it veils
The Southern Hills, the painted leopardâs home.
And spreads afar, until the northern sea
Leviathans are amazed and lose their course.
And denser yet it touches on the sky.
And spreads a heavy mantle over the earth.
Then, wide as is the high pitched arch of heaven,
Therein appears no single rift of blue.
Now mighty whales lead up their spouses to sport
Upon the waves, the sinuous dragons dive
Deep down and, breathing, swell the heaving sea,
The earth is moist as with the early rains,
And springâs creative energy is chilled.
Both far and wide and high the damp fog spreads,
Great cities on the eastern bank are hid,
Wide ports and mountains in the south are lost,
Whole fleets of battle ships, a thousand keels,
Hide in the misty depths; frail fishing boats
High riding on a wave are seen â-and lost.
The gloom increases and the domed sky
Grows dark and darker as the sunâs light fails.
The daylight dies, dim twilightâs reign begins,
The ruddy hills dissolve and lose their hue.
The skill of matchless King Yu would fail to sound
The depth and height; and Li Louâs eye, though keen,
Could never pierce this gloom.
Now is the time, O sea and river gods, to use your powers.
The gliding fish and creeping water folk
Are lost; there is no track for bird or beast.
Fair Penglai Isles are hidden from our sight,
The lofty gates of heaven have disappeared.
Nature is blurred and indistinct, as when
A driving rain storm hurries over the earth.
And then, perhaps, within the heavy haze,
A noisome serpent vents his venom foul
And plagues descend, or impish demons work
Their wicked wills.
Ills fall on humans but do not stay,
Heavenâs cleansing breath sweeps them sway,
But while they last the mean ones cry,
The nobler suffer silently.
The greatest turmoil is a sign
Of quick return to state benign.
The little fleet reached Cao Caoâs naval camp about the fifth watch, and
Zhuge Liang gave orders to form line lying prows west, and then to beat the
drums and shout.
âBut what shall we do if they attack us?â exclaimed Lu Su.
Zhuge Liang replied with a smile, âI think their fleet will not venture out
in this fog. Go on with your wine, and let us be happy. We will go back when
the fog lifts.â
As soon as the shouting from the river was heard by those in the camp, the two
admirals, Mao Jie and Yu Jin, ran off to report to Cao Cao, who said, âComing
up in a fog like this means that they have prepared an ambush for us. Do not go
out, but get all the force together and shoot at them.â
He also sent orders to the ground camps to dispatch six thousand of archers and
crossbowmen to aid the marines.
The naval forces were then lined up shooting on the bank to prevent a landing.
Presently the soldiers arrived, and ten thousand and more soldiers were
shooting down into the river, where the arrows fell like rain. By and bye Zhuge
Liang ordered the boats to turn round so that their prows pointed east and to
go closer in so that many arrows might hit them.
Zhuge Liang ordered the drums to be kept beating till the sun was high and the
fog began to disperse, when the boats got under way and sailed down stream. The
whole twenty boats were bristling with arrows on both sides.
As they left, Zhuge Liang asked all the crews to shout derisively, âWe thank
you, Sir Prime Minister, for the arrows!â
They told Cao Cao, but by the time he came, the light boats helped by the swift
current were seven miles long down the river and pursuit was impossible. Cao
Cao saw that he had been duped and was very sorry, but there was no help for
it.
On the way down Zhuge Liang said to his companion, âEvery boat must have five
or six thousand arrows and so, without the expenditure of an ounce of energy,
we must have more than ten myriad arrows, which tomorrow can be shot back again
at Cao Caoâs army to his great inconvenience.â
âYou are really superhuman,â said Lu Su. âBut how did you know there
would be a thick fog today?â
âOne cannot be a leader without knowing the workings of heaven and the ways
of earth. One must understand the secret gates and the interdependence of the
elements, the mysteries of tactics and the value of forces. It is but an
ordinary talent. I calculated three days ago that there would be a fog today,
and so I set the limit at three days. Zhou Yu would give me ten days, but
neither artificers nor materials, so that he might find occasion to put me to
death as I knew. But my fate lies with the Supreme, and how could Zhou Yu harm
me?â
Lu Su could not but agree. When the boats arrived, five hundred soldiers were
in readiness on the bank to carry away the arrows. Zhuge Liang bade them go on
board the boats, collect them and bear them to the tent of the Commander-in-
Chief. Lu Su went to report that the arrows had been obtained and told Zhou Yu
by what means.
Zhou Yu was amazed and sighed sadly, saying, âHe is better than I. His
methods are more than human.â
Thick lies the fog on the river,
Nature is shrouded in white,
Distant and near are confounded,
Banks are no longer in sight.
Fast fly the pattering arrows,
Stick in the boats of the fleet.
Now can full tale be delivered,
Zhuge Liang is victor complete.
When, shortly after his return, Zhuge Liang went to the tent of the Commander-
in-Chief, he was welcomed by Zhou Yu, who came forward to greet him, saying,
âYour superhuman predictions compel oneâs esteem.â
âThere is nothing remarkable in that trifling trick,â replied he.
Zhou Yu led him within and wine was brought.
Then Zhou Yu said, âMy lord sent yesterday to urge me to advance, but I have
no master plan ready. I wish you would assist me, Master.â
âBut where should I, a man of poor everyday ability, find such a plan as you
desire?â
âI saw the enemyâs naval camp just lately, and it looked very complete and
well organized. It is not an ordinary place to attack. I have thought of a
plan, but I am not sure it will answer. I should be happy if you would decide
for me.â
âGeneral,â replied Zhuge Liang, âdo not say what your plan is, but each
of us will write in the palm of his hand and see whether our opinions agree.â
So brush and ink were sent for, and Zhou Yu first wrote on his own palm, and
then passed the pen to Zhuge Liang who also wrote. Then getting close together
on the same bench, each showed his hand to the other, and both burst out
laughing, for both had written the same word, âFire.â
âSince we are of the same opinion,â said Zhou Yu, âthere is no longer any
doubt. But our intentions must be kept secret.â
âBoth of us are public servants, and what would be the sense of telling our
plans? I do not think Cao Cao will be on his guard against this, although he
has had two experiences. You may put your scheme into force.â
They finished their wine and separated. Not an officer knew a word of their
plans.
Now Cao Cao had expended a myriad arrows in vain and was much irritated in
consequence. He deeply desired revenge.
Then Xun You proposed a ruse, saying, âThe two strategists on the side of the
enemy are Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang, two men most difficult to get the better of.
Let us send someone who shall pretend to surrender to them but really be a spy
on our behalf and a helper in our schemes. When we know what is doing, we can
plan to meet it.â
âI had thought of that myself,â replied Cao Cao. âWhom do you think the
best person to send?â
âCai Mao has been put to death, but all his clan and family are in the army,
and his two younger brothers are junior generals. You have them most securely
in your power and may send them to surrender. The ruler of the South Land will
never suspect deceit there.â
Cao Cao decided to act on this plan, and in the evening summoned Cai Zhong and
Cai He to his tent, where he told them, saying, âI want you to pretend to
surrender to the South Land so that you can gather intelligence and sent it
back. When all done, you will be richly rewarded. But do not betray me.â
âOur families are in Jingzhou, and that place is yours,â replied they.
âShould we dare betray? You need have no doubts, Sir. You will soon see the
heads of both Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang at your feet.â
Cao Cao gave them generous gifts. Soon after the two men, each with his five
hundred soldiers, set sail with a fair wind for the opposite bank.
Now as Zhou Yu was preparing for the attack, the arrival of some northern ships
was announced. They bore the two younger brothers of Cai Mao, who had come as
deserters.
They were led in and, bowing before the general, said, weeping, âOur innocent
brother has been put to death, and we desire vengeance. So we have come to
offer allegiance to you. We pray you appoint us to the vanguard.â
Zhou Yu appeared very pleased and made them presents. Then he ordered them to
join Gan Ning in leading the van. They thanked him and regarded their scheme as
already a success.
But Zhou Yu gave Gan Ning secret orders, saying, âThey have come without
their families, and so I know their desertion is only pretense. They have been
sent as spies, and I am going to meet their ruse with one of my own. They shall
have some information to send. You will treat them well, but keep a careful
guard over them. On the day our soldiers start the offense, they shall be
sacrificed to the flag. But be very careful that nothing goes wrong.â
Gan Ning went away.
Then Lu Su came to tell Zhou Yu, saying, âEveryone agrees in thinking the
surrender of Cai Zhong and Cai He feigned and they should be rejected.â
âBut they wish to revenge the death of their brother,â said the Fleet
Admiral. âWhere is the pretense? If you are so suspicious, you will receive
nobody at all.â
Lu Su left much piqued and went to see Zhuge Liang to whom he told the story.
Zhuge Liang only smiled.
âWhy do you smile?â said Lu Su.
âI smile at your simplicity. The General is playing a game. Spies cannot
easily come and go, so these two have been sent to feign desertion that they
may act as spies. The General is meeting one ruse with another. He wants them
to give false information. Deceit is not to be despised in war, and his scheme
is the correct one to employ.â
Then Lu Su understood.
That night as Zhou Yu was sitting in his tent, Huang Gai came to see him
privately.
Zhou Yu said, âYou have surely some wise plan to propose that you come at
night like this.â
Huang Gai replied, âThe enemy are more numerous than we, and it is wrong to
delay. Why not burn them out?â
âWho suggested that to you?â
âI thought of it myself. Nobody suggested it,â replied Huang Gai.
âI just wanted something like this, and that is why I kept those two
pretended deserters. I want them to give some false news. The pity is that I
have no one to feign desertion to the other side and work my plan.â
âBut I will carry out your plan,â said Huang Gai.
âBut if you cannot show some injury, you will not be believed,â said Zhou
Yu.
âThe Sun family have been very generous to me, and I would not resent being
crushed to death to repay them,â said Huang Gai.
Zhou Yu bowed and thanked him, saying, âIf you would not object to some
bodily suffering, then the South Land would indeed be happy.â
âKill me. I do not mind,â repeated Huang Gai as he took his leave.
Next day the drums called all the officers together to the Commander-in-
Chiefâs tent, and Zhuge Liang came with the others.
Zhou Yu said, âThe enemyâs camps extend about one hundred miles so that the
campaign will be a long one. Each leader is to prepare supplies for three
months.â
Scarcely had he spoken when Huang Gai started up, crying, âSay not three
months. Be ready for thirty months, and even then it will not be ended. If you
can destroy them this month, then all is well. If you cannot, then it were
better to take Zhang Zhaoâs advice, throw down your weapons, turn to the
north, and surrender.â
Zhou Yuâs anger flared up, and he flushed, crying, âOur lordâs orders
were to destroy Cao Cao, and whoever mentioned the word surrender should be put
to death! Now, the very moment when the two armies are to engage, you dare talk
of surrender and damp the ardor of my army! If I do not slay you, how can I
support the others?â
He ordered the lictors to remove Huang Gai and execute him without delay.
Huang Gai then flamed up in turn, saying, âThis is the third generation since
I went with General Sun Jian, and we overran the southeast. Whence have you
sprung up?â
This made Zhou Yu perfectly furious, and Huang Gai was ordered to instant
death. But Gan Ning interfered.
Said he, âHe is a veteran officer of the South Land. Pray pardon him!â
âWhat are you prating about?â cried Zhou Yu. âDare you come between me
and my duty?â
Turning to the lictors, Zhou Yu ordered them to drive Gan Ning forth with
blows.
The other officials fell on their knees entreating pity for Huang Gai.
âHe is indeed most worthy of death, but it would be a loss to the army. We
pray you forgive him. Record his fault for the moment; and after the enemy
shall have been defeated, then put him to death.â
But Zhou Yu was implacable. The officers pleaded with tears.
At length he seemed moved, saying, âHad you not interceded, he should
certainly have suffered death. But now I will mitigate the punishment to a
beating. He shall not die.â
Zhou Yu turned to the lictors and bade them deal the culprit one hundred blows.
Again his colleagues prayed for remission, but Zhou Yu angrily pushed over the
table in front of him and roared to the officers to get out of the way and let
the sentence be executed.
So Huang Gai was stripped, thrown to the ground, and fifty blows were given. At
this point the officers again prayed that he be let off.
Zhou Yu sprang from his chair and pointing his finger at Huang Gai said, âIf
you dare flout me again, you shall have the other fifty. If you are guilty of
any disrespect, you shall be punished for both faults!â
With this he turned into the inner part of the tent, growling as he went, while
the officers helped their beaten colleague to his feet. He was in a deplorable
state. His back was cut in many places, and the blood was flowing in streams.
They led him to his own quarters and on the way he swooned several times. His
case seemed most pitiable.
Lu Su went to see the suffering officer and then called on Zhuge Liang in his
boat.
Lu Su related the story of the beating and said, âThough the other officers
have been cowed into silence, I think thought you, Sir, might have interceded.
You are a guest and not under Zhou Yuâs orders. Why did you stand by with
your hands up your sleeves and say never a word?â
âYou insult me,â said Zhuge Liang smiling.
âWhy do you say that? I have never insulted you: Never since the day we came
here together.â
âDo you not know that terrible beating was but a ruse? How could I try to
dissuade Zhou Yu?â
Then Lu Su began to perceive, and Zhuge Liang continued, saying, âCao Cao
would not be taken in unless there was some real bodily suffering. Zhou Yu is
going to send Huang Gai over as a deserter, and Zhou Yu will see to it that the
two Cao Caoâs spies duly tell the tale. But when you see the General, you
must not tell him that I saw through the ruse. You say that I am very angry
like the others.â
Lu Su went to see Zhou Yu and asked, âWhy have you so cruelly beaten a proved
and trusty officer?â
âDo the officers resent it?â asked Zhou Yu.
âThey are all upset about it.â
âAnd what does your friend think?â
âZhuge Liang also resents it in his heart, and he thinks you have made a
mistake.â
âThen I have deceived him for once,â said Zhou Yu gleefully.
âWhat mean you?â cried Lu Su.
âThat beating that Huang Gai got is part of my ruse. I am sending him to Cao
Cao as a deserter, and so I have supplied a reason for desertion. Then I am
going to use fire against the enemy.â
Lu Su kept silence, but he recognized that Zhuge Liang was again right.
Meanwhile Huang Gai lay in his tent, whither all his colleague officers went to
condole with him and inquire after his health. But Huang Gai would say never a
word. He only lay sighing deeply from time to time.
But when the Strategist Kan Ze came, Huang Gai told them to bring him to the
room where he lay. Then he bade the servants go away.
Kan Ze said, âSurely you must have some serious quarrel with the General.â
âI have none,â said Huang Gai.
âThen this beating is just part of a ruse?â
âHow did you guess?â said Huang Gai.
âBecause I watched the General, and I guessed about nine tenths of the
truth.â
Huang Gai said, âYou see I have been very generously treated by the Sun
family, all three of them, and have no means of showing my gratitude except by
offering to help in this ruse. True I suffer, but I do not regret that. Among
all those I know in the army, there is not one I am intimate with except
yourself. You are true, and I can talk with you as a friend.â
âI suppose you wish me to present your surrender letter to Cao Cao. Is that
it?â
âJust that; will you do it?â said Huang Gai.
Kan Ze consented joyfully.
Even the warriorâs body is but a stake in the game,
The friend so ready to help him proves that their hearts are the same.
Kan Zeâs reply will be read in the next chapter.

was too poor to buy, he used to borrow. He had a wonderfully tenacious memory,
was very eloquent and no coward. Sun Quan had employed him among his advisers,
and he and Huang Gai were excellent friends.
Now Huang Gai had thought of Kan Ze to present the treacherous letter to Cao
Cao, as Kan Zeâs gifts made him most suitable.
Kan Ze accepted with enthusiasm, saying, âWhen you, my friend, have suffered
so much for our lord, could I spare myself? No! While a person lives, he must
go on fulfilling his mission, or he is no better than the herbs that rot in the
field.â
Huang Gai slipped off the couch and came over to salute him.
âHowever, this matter must speed,â continued Kan Ze. âThere is no time to
lose.â
âThe letter is already written,â said Huang Gai.
Kan Ze received it and left. That night he disguised himself as an old
fisherman and started in a small punt for the north shore, under the cold,
glittering light of the stars. Soon he drew near the enemyâs camp and was
captured by the patrol.
Without waiting for day, they informed Cao Cao, who said at once, âIs he not
just a spy?â
âNo,â said they, âhe is alone, just an old fisherman. And he says he is
an adviser in the service of the South Land named Kan Ze, and he has come on
secret business.â
âBring him,â said Cao Cao, and Kan Ze was led in.
Cao Cao was seated in a brilliantly lighted tent. He was leaning on a small
table, and as soon as he saw the prisoner, he said harshly, âYou are an
adviser of East Wu. What then are you doing here?â
âPeople say that you greedily welcome people of ability. I do not think your
question a very proper one. O friend Huang Gai, you made a mistake,â said Kan
Ze.
âYou know I am fighting against East Wu, and you come here privately. Why
should I not question you?â
âHuang Gai is an old servant of Wu, one who has served three successive
rulers. Now he has been cruelly beaten, for no fault, before the face of all
the officers in Zhou Yuâs camp. He is grievously angry about this and wishes
to desert to your side that he may be revenged. He discussed it with me, and as
we are inseparable, I have come to give you his letter asking whether you would
receive him.â
âWhere is the letter? said Cao Cao.
The missive was produced and presented. Cao Cao opened it and read:
âI, Huang Gai, have been generously treated by the Sun family and have served
them single-heartedly. Lately they have been discussing an attack with our
forces on the enormous army of the central government. Everyone knows our few
are no match for such a multitude, and every officer of the South Land, wise or
foolish, recognizes that quite well. However, Zhou Yu who, after all, is but a
youth and a shallow minded simpleton, maintains that success is possible and
rashly desires to smash stones with an egg. Beside, he is arbitrary and
tyrannical, punishing for no crime, and leaving meritorious service unrewarded.
I am an old servant and for no reason have been shamed in the sight of people.
Wherefore I hate him in my heart.
âYou, O Prime Minister, treat people with sincerity and are ready to welcome
ability and so I, and those under my leadership, desire to enter your service
whereby to acquire reputation and remove the shameful stigma. The commissariat,
weapons, and the supply ships that I am commanding will also come over to you.
In perfect sincerity I state these matters. I pray you not to doubt me.â
Leaning there on the low table by his side, Cao Cao turned this letter over and
over and read it again and again.
Then he smacked the table, opened his eyes wide with anger, saying, âHuang
Gai is trying to play the personal injury trick on me, is he? And you are in it
as the intermediary to present the letter. How dare you come to sport with
me?â
Cao Cao ordered the lictors to thrust forth the messenger and take off his
head. Kan Ze was hustled out, his face untroubled. On the contrary, he laughed
aloud.
At this Cao Cao told them to bring him back and harshly said to him, âWhat do
you find to laugh at now that I have foiled you and your ruse has failed?â
âI was not laughing at you. I was laughing at my friendâs simplicity.â
âWhat do you mean by his simplicity?â
âIf you want to slay, slay. Do not trouble me with a multitude of
questions.â
âI have read all the books on the art of war, and I am well versed in all
ways of misleading the enemy. This ruse of yours might have succeeded with
many, but it will not do for me.â
âAnd so you say that the letter is a vicious trick?â said Kan Ze.
âWhat I say is that your little slip has sent you to the death you risked. If
the thing was real and you were sincere, why does not the letter name a time of
coming over? What have you to say to that?â
Kan Ze waited to the end and then laughed louder than ever, saying, âI am so
glad you are not frightened but can still boast of your knowledge of the books
of war. Now you will not lead away your soldiers. If you fight, Zhou Yu will
certainly capture you. But how sad to think I die at the hand of such an
ignorant fellow!â
âWhat mean you? I, ignorant?â
âYou are ignorant of any strategy and a victim of unreason. Is not that
sufficient?â
âWell then, tell me where is any fault.â
âYou treat wise people too badly for me to talk to you. You can finish me and
let there be an end of it.â
âIf you can speak with any show of reason, I will treat you differently.â
âDo you not know that when one is going to desert oneâs master and become a
renegade, one cannot say exactly when the chance will occur? If one binds
oneâs self to a fixed moment and the thing cannot be done just then, the
secret will be discovered. One must watch for an opportunity and take it when
it comes. Think: Is it possible to know exactly when? But you know nothing of
common sense. All you know is how to put good people to death. So you really
are an ignorant fellow!â
At this Cao Cao changed his manner, got up, and came over to the prisoner
bowing, âI did not see clearly. That is quite true. I offended you, and I
hope you will forget it.â
âThe fact is that Huang Gai and I are both inclined to desert to you. We even
yearn for it as a child desires its parents. Is it possible that we should play
you false?â
âIf you two could render me so great a service, you shall certainly be richly
rewarded.â
âWe do not desire rank or riches. We come because it is the will of Heaven
and the plain way of duty.â
Then wine was set out, and Kan Ze was treated as an honored guest. While they
were drinking, someone came in and whispered in Cao Caoâs ear.
He replied, âLet me see the letter.â
Whereupon the man pulled out and gave him a letter, which evidently pleased
him.
âThat is from the two Cai brothers,â thought Kan Ze. âThey are reporting
the punishment of my friend, and that will be a proof of the sincerity of his
letter.â
Turning toward Kan Ze, Cao Cao said, âI must ask you to return to settle the
date with your friend. As soon as I know, I will have a force waiting.â
âI cannot return. Pray, Sir, send some other one you can trust.â
âIf someone else should go, the secret would be discovered.â
Kan Ze refused again and again but at last gave way, saying, âIf I am to go,
I must not wait here. I must be off at once.â
Cao Cao offered him gold and silks, which were refused. Kan Ze started, left
the camp, and reembarked for the south bank, where he related all that had
happened to Huang Gai.
âIf it had not been for your persuasive tongue, then had I undergone this
suffering in vain,â said Huang Gai.
âI will now go to get news of the two Cai brothers,â said Kan Ze.
âExcellent,â said Huang Gai.
Kan Ze went to the camp commanded by Gan Ning.
When they were seated, Kan Ze said to his host, âI was much distressed when I
saw how disgracefully you were treated for your intercession on behalf of Huang
Gai.â
Gan Ning smiled. Just then the two Cai brothers came, and host and guest
exchanged glances.
Gan Ning said, âThe truth is Zhou Yu is over confident, and he reckons us as
nobody. We count for nothing. Everyone is talking of the way I was insulted.â
And he shouted and gritted his teeth and smacked the table in his wrath.
Kan Ze leaned over toward his host and said something in a very low voice, at
which Gan Ning bent his head and sighed.
Cai He and Cai Zhong gathered from this scene that both Gan Ning and Kan Ze
were ripe for desertion and determined to probe them.
âWhy, Sir, do you anger him? Why not be silent about your injuries?â said
they.
âWhat know you of our bitterness?â said Kan Ze.
âWe think you seem much inclined to go over to Cao Cao,â said they.
Kan Ze at this lost color. Gan Ning started up and drew his sword, crying,
âThey have found out. They must die to keep their mouths shut!â
âNo, no,â cried the two in a flurry. âLet us tell you something quite
secret!â
âQuick, then!â cried Gan Ning.
So Cai He said, âThe truth is that we are only pretended deserters, and if
you two gentlemen are of our way of thinking, we can manage things for you.â
âBut are you speaking the truth?â said Gan Ning.
âIs it likely we should say such a thing if it were untrue?â cried both at
the same moment.
Gan Ning put on a pleased look and said, âThen this is the very heaven-given
chance.â
âYou know we have already told Cao Cao of the Huang Gai affair and how you
were insulted.â
âThe fact is I have given the Prime Minister a letter on behalf of Huang Gai,
and he sent me back again to settle the date of Huang Gaiâs desertion,â
said Kan Ze.
âWhen an honest person happens upon an enlightened master, his heart will
always be drawn toward him,â said Gan Ning.
The four then drank together and opened their hearts to each other. The two Cai
Zhong and Cai He wrote a private letter to their master saying Gan Ning has
agreed to join in our plot and play the traitor, and Kan Ze also wrote, and
they sent the letters secretly to Cao Cao.
Kan Zeâs letter said:
âHuang Gai has found no opportunity so far. However, when he comes, his boat
can be recognized by a black, indented flag. That shall mean he is on board.â
However, when Cao Cao got these two letters, he was still doubtful and called
together his advisers to talk over the matter.
Said he, âOn the other side Gan Ning has been put to shame by the Commander-
in-Chief whom he is prepared to betray for the sake of revenge. Huang Gai has
been punished and sent Kan Ze to propose that he should come over to our side.
Only I still distrust the whole thing. Who will go over to the camp to find out
the real truth?â
Then Jiang Gan spoke up, saying, âI failed in my mission the other day and am
greatly mortified. I will risk my life again and, this time, I shall surely
bring good news.â
Cao Cao approved of him as messenger and bade him start. Jiang Gan set out in a
small craft and speedily arrived in the Three Gorges, landing near the naval
camp. Then he sent to inform Zhou Yu.
Hearing who it was, Zhou Yu chuckled, saying, âSuccess depends upon this
man.â
Then Zhou Yu called Lu Su and told him to call Pang Tong to come and do certain
things for him.
This Pang Tong was from Xiangyang. And he had gone to the east of the river to
get away from the strife. Lu Su had recommended him to Zhou Yu, but he had not
yet presented himself.
When Zhou Yu sent Lu Su to ask what scheme of attack he would recommend against
Cao Cao, Pang Tong had said to Lu Su, âYou must use fire against him. But the
river is wide and if one ship is set on fire, the others will scatter unless
they are fastened together so that they must remain in one place. That is the
one road to success.â
Lu Su took this message to Zhou Yu, who pondered over it and then said, âThe
only person who can manage this is Pang Tong himself.â
âCao Cao is very wily,â said Lu Su. âHow can Pang Tong go?â
So Zhou Yu was sad and undecided. He could think of no method till suddenly the
means presented itself in the arrival of Jiang Gan.
Zhou Yu at once sent instructions to Pang Tong how to act, and then sat himself
in his tent to await his visitor Jiang Gan.
But the visitor became ill at ease and suspicious when he saw that his old
student friend did not come to welcome him, and he took the precaution of
sending his boat into a retired spot to be made fast before he went to the
generalâs tent.
When Zhou Yu saw Jiang Gan, Zhou Yu put on an angry face and said, âMy
friend, why did you treat me so badly?â
Jiang Gan laughed and said, âI remembered the old days when we were as
brothers, and I came expressly to pour out my heart to you. Why do you say I
treated you badly?â
âYou came to persuade me to betray my master, which I would never do unless
the sea dried up and the rocks perished. Remembering the old times, I filled
you with wine and kept you to sleep with me. And you, you plundered my private
letters and stole away with never a word of farewell. You betrayed me to Cao
Cao and caused the death of my two friends on the other side and so caused all
my plans to miscarry. Now what have you come for? Certainly, it is not out of
kindness to me. I would cut you in two, but I still care for our old
friendship. I would send you back again, but within a day or two I shall attack
that rebel. If I let you stay in my camp, my plans will leak out. So I am going
to tell my attendants to conduct you to a certain retired hut in the Western
Hills, and keep you there till I shall have won the victory. Then I will send
you back again.â
Jiang Gan tried to say something, but Zhou Yu would not listen. He turned his
back and went into the recesses of his tent. The attendants led the visitor
off, set him on a horse, and took him away over the hills to the small hut,
leaving two soldiers to look after him.
When Jiang Gan found himself in the lonely hut, he was very depressed and had
no desire to eat or sleep. But one night, when the stars were very brilliant,
he strolled out to enjoy them. Presently he came to the rear of his lonely
habitation and heard, near by, someone crooning over a book. Approaching with
stealthy steps, he saw a tiny cabin half hidden in a cliff whence a slender
beam or two of light stole out between the rafters. He went nearer and peeping
in, saw a man reading by the light of a lamp near which hung a sword. And the
book was Sun Ziâs classic âThe Art of War.â
âThis is no common person,â thought Jiang Gan, and so he knocked at the
door.
The door was opened by the reader, who bade him welcome with cultivated and
refined ceremony. Jiang Gan inquired his name.
The host replied, âI am Pang Tong.â
âThen you are surely the Master known as Young Phoenix, are you not?â
âYes, I am he.â
âHow often have I heard you talked about! You are famous. But why are you
hidden away in this spot?â
âThat fellow Zhou Yu is too conceited to allow that anyone else has any
talent, and so I live here quietly. But who are you, Sir?â
âI am Jiang Gan.â
Then Pang Tong made him welcome and led him in, and the two sat down to talk.
âWith your gifts, you would succeed anywhere,â said Jiang Gan. âIf you
would enter Cao Caoâs service, I would recommend you to him.â
âI have long desired to get away from here. And if you, Sir, will present me,
there is no time like the present. If Zhou Yu heard of my wish, he would kill
me, I am sure.â
So without more ado, they made their way down the hill to the waterâs edge to
seek the boat in which Jiang Gan had come. They embarked and, rowing swiftly,
they soon reached the northern shore. At the central camp, Jiang Gan landed and
went to seek Cao Cao to whom he related the story of the discovery of his new
acquaintance.
When Cao Cao heard that the newcomer was Master Young Phoenix, Cao Cao went to
meet him personally, made him very welcome, and soon they sat down to talk on
friendly terms.
Cao Cao said, âAnd so Zhou Yu in his youth is conceited and annoys his
officers and rejects all their advice: I know that. But your fame has been long
known to me, and now that you have been gracious enough to turn my way, I pray
you not to be thrifty of your advice.â
âI, too, know well that you are a model of military strategy,â said Pang
Tong, âbut I should like to have one look at your disposition.â
So horses were brought, and the two rode out to the lines, host and visitor on
equal terms, side by side. They ascended a hill whence they had a wide view of
the land base.
After looking all round Pang Tong remarked, âWu Qi the Great General, came to
life again, could not do better, nor Sun Zi the Famed Strategist if he
reappeared! All accords with the precepts. The camp is beside the hills and is
flanked by a forest. The front and rear are within sight of each other. Gates
of egress and ingress are provided, and the roads of advance and retirement are
bent and broken.â
âMaster, I entreat you not to overpraise me, but to advise me where I can
make further improvements,â said Cao Cao.
Then the two men rode down to the naval camp, where twenty four gates were
arranged facing south. The cruisers and the battleships were all lined up so as
to protect the lighter crafts which lay inside. There were channels to pass to
and fro and fixed anchorages and stations.
Pang Tong surveying all this smiled, saying, âSir Prime Minister, if this is
your method of warfare, you enjoy no empty reputation.â
Then pointing to the southern shore, he went on, âZhou Yu! Zhou Yu! You are
finished. You will have to die.â
Cao Cao was mightily pleased. They rode back to the chief tent and wine was
brought. They discussed military matters, and Pang Tong held forth at length.
Remarks and comments flowed freely between the two, and Cao Cao formed an
exalted opinion of his new adherentâs abilities and treated him with the
greatest honor.
By and bye the guest seemed to have succumbed to the influence of many cups and
said, âHave you any capable medical people in your army?â
âWhat are they for, Master?â said Cao Cao.
âThere is a lot of illness among the marines, and you ought to find some
remedy.â
The fact was that at this time Cao Caoâs men were suffering from the climate.
Many were vomiting and not a few had died. It was a source of great anxiety to
him, and when the newcomer suddenly mentioned it, of course he had to ask
advice.
Pang Tong said, âYour marine force is excellent, but there is just one
defect. It is not quite perfect.â
Cao Cao pressed him to say where the imperfection lay.
âI have a plan to overcome the ailment of the soldiers so that no one shall
be sick and all fit for service.â
âWhat is this excellent scheme?â said Cao Cao.
âThe river is wide, and the tides ebb and flow. The winds and waves are never
at rest. Your troops from the north are unused to ships, and the motion makes
them ill. If your ships, large and small, were classed and divided into
thirties, or fifties, and joined up stem to stem by iron chains and boards
spread across them, to say nothing of soldiers being able to pass from one to
the next, even horses could move about on them. If this were done, then there
would be no fear of the wind and the waves and the rising and falling tides.â
Coming down from his seat, Cao Cao thanked his guest, saying, âI could never
defeat the land of the south without this scheme of yours.â
âThat is only my idea,â said Pang Tong. âIt is for you to decide about
it.â
Orders were then issued to call up all the blacksmiths and set them to work,
night and day, forging iron chains and great bolts to lock together the ships.
And the soldiers rejoiced when they heard of the plan.
In the Red Cliffsâ fight they used the flame,
The weapon here will be the same.
By Pang Tongâs advice the ships were chained,
Else Zhou Yu had not that battle gained.
Pang Tong further told Cao Cao, saying, âI know many bold people on the other
side who hate Zhou Yu. If I may use my little tongue in your service, I can
induce them to come over to you. If Zhou Yu be left alone, you can certainly
take him captive. And Liu Bei is of no account.â
âCertainly if you could render me so great a service, I would memorialize the
Throne and obtain for you one of the highest offices,â said Cao Cao.
âI am not doing this for the sake of wealth or honors, but from a desire to
succor humankind. If you cross the river, I pray you be merciful.â
âI am Heavenâs means of doing right and could not bear to slay the
people.â
Pang Tong thanked him and begged for a document that would protect his own
family.
Cao Cao asked, âWhere do they live?â
âAll are near the river bank.â
And Cao Cao ordered a protection declaration to be prepared. Having sealed it,
he gave it to Pang Tong.
Pang Tong said, âYou should attack as soon as I have gone, but do not let
Zhou Yu doubt anything.â
Cao Cao promised secrecy, and the wily traitor took his leave. Just as he was
about to embark, he met a man in a Daoist robe, with a bamboo comb in his hair,
who stopped him.
The man said, âYou are very bold. Huang Gai is planning to use the
âpersonal injury ruseâ, and Kan Ze has presented the letter of pretended
desertion. You have proffered the fatal scheme of chaining the ships together
lest the flames may not completely destroy them. This sort of mischievous work
may have been enough to deceive Cao Cao, but I saw it all.â
Pang Tong become helpless with fear â-his viscera flown away, his spirit
scattered.
By guileful means one may succeed,
The victims too find friends in need.
The next chapter will tell who the stranger was.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 48 ****
In the last chapter Pang Tong was brought up with a sudden shock when someone
seized him and said of his scheme. Upon turning to look at the man, Pang Tong
saw it was Xu Shu, an old friend, and his heart revived.
Looking around and seeing no one near, Pang Tong said, âIt would be a pity if
you upset my plan. The fate of the people of all the eighty-one southern
counties is in your hands.â
Xu Shu smiled, saying, âAnd what of the fate of these eight hundred thirty
thousand soldiers and horse of the north?â
âDo you intend to wreck my scheme, Xu Shu?â
âI have never forgotten the kindness of Uncle Liu Bei, nor my oath to avenge
the death of my mother at Cao Caoâs hands. I have said I would never think
out a plan for him. So am I likely to wreck yours now, brother? But I have
followed Cao Caoâs army thus far; and after they shall have been defeated,
good and bad will suffer alike and how can I escape? Tell me how I can secure
safety, and I sew up my lips and go away.â
Pang Tong smiled, âIf you are as high-minded as that, there is no great
difficulty.â
âStill I wish you would instruct me.â
So Pang Tong whispered something in his ear, which seemed to please Xu Shu
greatly, for he thanked him most cordially and took his leave. Then Pang Tong
betook himself to his boat and left for the southern shore.
His friend gone, Xu Shu mischievously spread certain rumors in the camp, and
next day were to be seen everywhere soldiers in small groups, some talking,
others listening, heads together and ears stretched out, till the camps seemed
to buzz.
Some of the officers went to Cao Cao and told him, saying, âA rumor is
running around the camps that Han Sui and Ma Teng are marching from Xiliang to
attack the capital.â
This troubled Cao Cao, who called together his advisers to council.
Said he, âThe only anxiety I have felt in this expedition was about the
possible doings of Han Sui and Ma Teng. Now there is a rumor running among the
soldiers, and though I know not whether it be true or false, it is necessary to
be on oneâs guard.â
At this point Xu Shu said, âYou have been kind enough to give me an office,
Sir, and I have really done nothing in return. If I may have three thousand
troops, I will march at once to San Pass and guard this entrance. If there be
any pressing matter, I will report at once.â
âIf you would do this, I should be quite at my ease. There are already troops
beyond the Pass, who will be under your command, and now I will give you three
thousand of horse and foot, and Zang Ba shall lead the van and march
quickly.â
Xu Shu took leave of the Prime Minister and left in company with Zang Ba. This
was Pang Tongâs scheme to secure the safety of Xu Shu.
A poem says:
Cao Cao marched south, but at his back
There rode the fear of rear attack.
Pang Tongâs good counsel Xu Shu took,
And thus the fish escaped the hook.
Cao Caoâs anxiety diminished after he had thus sent away Xu Shu. Then he rode
round all the camps, first the land forces and then the naval. He boarded one
of the large ships and thereon set up his standard. The naval camps were
arranged along two lines, and every ship carried a thousand bows and crossbows.
While Cao Cao remained with the fleet, it occurred the full moon of the
eleventh month of the thirteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 208). The sky
was clear; there was no wind; and the river lay unruffled. He prepared a great
banquet, with music, and thereto invited all his leaders. As evening drew on,
the moon rose over the eastern hills in its immaculate beauty, and beneath it
lay the broad belt of the river like a band of pure silk. It was a great
assembly, and all the guests were clad in gorgeous silks and embroidered robes,
and the arms of the fighting soldiers glittered in the moonlight. The officers,
civil and military, were seated in their proper order of precedence.
The setting, too, was exquisite. The Southern Hills were outlined as in a
picture; the boundaries of Chaisang lay in the east; the river showed west as
far as Xiakou; on the south lay the Fan Mountains, on the north was the Black
Forest. The view stretched wide on every side.
Cao Caoâs heart was jubilant, and he harangued the assembly, saying, âMy
one aim since I enlisted my first small band of volunteers has been the removal
of evil from the state, and I have sworn to cleanse the country and restore
tranquillity. Now there is only left this land of the south to withstand me. I
am at the head of a hundred legions. I depend upon you, gentlemen, and have no
doubt of my final success. After I have subdued the South Land, there will be
no trouble in all the country. Then we shall enjoy wealth and honor and revel
in peace.â
They rose in a body and expressed their appreciation, saying, âWe trust that
you may soon report complete victory, and we shall all repose in the shade of
your good fortune.â
In his elation, Cao Cao bade the servants bring more wine and they drank till
late at night.
Warmed and mellowed, the host pointed to the south bank, saying, âZhou Yu and
Lu Su know not the appointed time. Heaven is aiding me bringing upon them the
misfortune of the desertion of their most trusted friends.â
âO Prime Minister, say nothing of these things lest they become known to the
enemy,â said Xun You.
But the Prime Minister only laughed.
âYou are all my trusty friends,â said he, âboth officers and humble
attendants. Why should I refrain?â
Pointing to Xiakou, he continued, âYou do not reckon for much with your puny
force, Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang. How foolish of you to attempt to shake the
Taishan Mountains!â
Then turning to his officers, he said, âI am now fifty-four; and if I get the
South Land, I shall have the wherewithal to rejoice. In the days of long ago,
the Patriarch Duke Qiao in the south and I were great friends, and we came to
an agreement on certain matters, for I knew his two daughters â-Elder Qiao
and Younger Qiao â-were lovely beyond words. Then by some means, they became
wives to Sun Ce and Zhou Yu. But now my palace of rest is built on the River
Zhang, and victory over the South Land will mean that I marry these two fair
women. I will put them in the Bronze Bird Tower, and they shall rejoice my
declining years. My desires will then be completely attained.â
He smiled at the anticipation.
Du Mu, a famous poet of the Tang Dynasty, in one poem says:
A broken halberd buried in the sand,
With deep rust eaten,
Loud tells of ancient battles on the strand,
When Cao Cao was beaten.
Had eastern winds Zhou Yuâs plan refused to aid
And fan the blaze,
The two fair Qiaos, in the Bronze Birdâs shade,
Would have been locked at spring age.
But suddenly amid the merriment was heard the hoarse cry of a raven flying
toward the south.
âWhy does the raven thus cry in the night?â said Cao Cao to those about
him.
âThe moon is so bright that it thinks it is day,â said they, âand so it
leaves its tree.â
Cao Cao laughed. By this time he was quite intoxicated. He set up his spear in
the prow of the ship and poured a libation into the river and then drank three
brimming goblets.
As he lowered the spear, he said, âThis is the spear that broke up the Yellow
Scarves, captured Lu Bu, destroyed Yuan Shao, and subdued Yuan Shu, whose
armies are now mine. In the north it reached to Liaodong, and it stretched out
over the whole south. It has never failed in its task. The present scene moves
me to the depths, and I will sing a song in which you shall accompany me.â
And so he sang:
âWhen goblets are brimming then sang is near birth,
But life is full short and has few days of mirth,
Life goes as the dew drops fly swiftly away,
Beneath the glance of the glowing hot ruler of day.
Humanâs life may be spent in the noblest enterprise,
But sorrowful thoughts in his heart oft arise.
Let us wash clean away the sad thoughts that intrude,
With bumpers of wine such as Du Kang once brewed.
Gone is my day of youthful fire
And still ungained is my desire.
The deer feed on the level plain
And joyful call, then feed again.
My noble guests are gathered round.
The air is trilled with joyful sound.
Bright my future lies before me.
As the moonlight on this plain;
But I strive in vain to reach it.
When shall I my wish attain?
None can answer; and so sadness
Grips my inmost heart again.
Far north and south,
Wide east and west,
We safety seek;
Vain is the quest.
Humanâs heart oft yearns
For converse sweet.
And my heart burns
When old friends greet.
The stars are paled by the full moonâs light,
The raven wings his southward flight.
And thrice he circles round a tree,
No place thereon to rest finds he.
They weary not the mountains of great height,
The waters deep of depth do not complain,
Duke Zhou no leisure found by day or night
Stern toil is his who would the empire gain.â
The song made they sang it with him and were all exceedingly merry, save one
guest who suddenly said, âWhen the great army is on the point of battle and
lives are about to be risked, why do you, O Prime Minister, speak such ill
words?â
Cao Cao turned quickly toward the speaker, who was Liu Fu, Imperial Protector
of Yangzhou. This Liu Fu sprang from Hefei. When first appointed to his post,
he had gathered in the terrified and frightened people and restored order. He
had founded schools and encouraged the people to till the land. He had long
served under Cao Cao and rendered valuable service.
When Liu Fu spoke, Cao Cao dropped his spear to the level and said, âWhat
ill-omened words did I use?â
âYou spoke of the moon paling the stars and the raven flying southward
without finding a resting place. These are ill-omened words.â
âHow dare you try to belittle my endeavor?â cried Cao Cao, very wrathful.
And with that he smote Liu Fu with his spear and slew him.
The assembly broke up, and the guests dispersed in fear and confusion. Next
day, when Cao Cao had recovered from his drunken bout, he was very grieved at
what he had done. When the murdered manâs son, Liu Xi, came to crave the body
of his father for burial, Cao Cao wept and expressed his sorrow.
âI am guilty of your fatherâs death. I was drunk yesterday. I regret the
deed exceedingly. Your father shall be interred with the honors of a minister
of the highest rank.â
Cao Cao sent an escort of soldiers to take the body to the homeland for burial.
A few days after, the two leaders of the naval force, Mao Jie and Yu Jin, came
to say the ships were all connected together by chains as had been ordered, and
all was now ready. They asked for the command to start.
Thereupon the leaders of both land and naval forces were assembled on board a
large ship in the center of the squadron to receive orders. The various armies
and squadrons were distinguished by different flags: Mao Jie and Yu Jin led the
central naval squadron with yellow flag; Zhang He, the leading squadron, red
flag; Lu Qian, the rear squadron, black flag; Wen Ping, the left squadron, blue
flag; and Li Tong, the right squadron, white flag. On shore Xu Huang commanded
the horsemen with red flag; Li Dian, the vanguard, black flag; Yue Jing, the
left wing, blue flag; and Xiahou Yuan, the right wing, white flag. Xiahou Dun
and Cao Hong were in reserve, and the general staff was under the leadership of
Xu Chu and Zhang Liao. The other leaders were ordered to remain in camps, but
ready for action.
All being ready, the squadron drums beat the roll thrice, and the ships sailed
out under a strong northwest wind on a trial cruise. When they got among the
waves, they were found to be as steady and immovable as the dry land itself.
The northern soldiers showed their delight at the absence of motion by capering
and flourishing their weapons. The ships moved on, the squadrons keeping quite
distinct. Fifty light cruisers sailed to and fro keeping order and urging
progress.
Cao Cao watched his navy from the Command Terrace and was delighted with their
evolutions and maneuvers. Surely this meant complete victory. He ordered the
recall and the squadrons returned in perfect order to their base.
Then Cao Cao went to his tent and summoned his advisers.
He said, âIf Heaven had not been on my side, should I have got this excellent
plan from the Young Phoenix? Now that the ships are attached firmly to each
other, one may traverse the river as easily as walking on firm earth.â
âThe ships are firmly attached to each other,â said Cheng Yu, âbut you
should be prepared for an attack by fire so that they can scatter to avoid
it.â
Cao Cao laughed.
âYou look a long way ahead,â said he, âbut you see what cannot happen.â
âCheng Yu speaks much to the point, my lord,â said Xun You. âWhy do you
laugh at him?â
Cao Cao said, âAnyone using fire depends upon the wind. This is now winter
and only west winds blow. You will get neither east nor south winds. I am on
the northwest, and the enemy is on the southeast bank. If they use fire, they
will destroy themselves. I have nothing to fear. If it was the tenth moon, or
early spring, I would provide against fire.â
âThe Prime Minister is indeed wise,â said the others in chorus. âNone can
equal him.â
âWith northern troops unused to shipboard, I could never have crossed the
river but for this chaining plan,â said Cao Cao.
Then he saw two of the secondary leaders stand up, and they said, âWe are
from the north, but we are also sailors. Pray give us a small squadron, and we
will seize some of the enemyâs flags and drums for you that we may prove
ourselves adepts on the water.â
The speakers were two men who had served under Yuan Shao, named Jiao Chu and
Zhang Neng.
âI do not think naval work would suit you two, born and brought up in the
north,â said Cao Cao. âThe southern soldiers are thoroughly accustomed to
ships. You should not regard your lives as a childâs plaything.â
They cried, âIf we fail, treat us according to army laws!â
âThe fighting ships are all chained together, there are only small, twenty-
men boats free. They are unsuitable for fighting.â
âIf we took large ships, where would be the wonderful in what we will do? No!
Give us a score of the small ships, and we will take half each and go straight
to the enemyâs naval port. We will just seize a flag, slay a leader, and come
home.â
âI will let you have the twenty ships and five hundred of good, vigorous
marines with long spears and stiff crossbows. Early tomorrow the main fleet
shall make a demonstration on the river, and I will also tell Wen Ping to
support you with thirty ships.â
The two men retired greatly elated.
Next morning, very early, food was prepared, and at the fifth watch all was
ready for a start. Then from the naval camp rolled out the drums and the gongs
clanged, as the ships moved out and took up their positions, the various flags
fluttering in the morning breeze. And the two intrepid leaders with their
squadron of small scouting boats went down the lines and out into the stream.
Now a few days before the sound of Cao Caoâs drums had been heard on the
southern bank, Zhou Yu had watched the maneuvers of the northern fleet on the
open river from the top of a hill till the fleet had gone in again. So when the
sound of drums was again heard, all the southern army went up the hills to
watch the northern fleet. All they saw was a squadron of small ships bounding
over the waves.
As the northern fleet came nearer, the news was taken to Zhou Yu who called for
volunteers to go out against them. Han Dang and Zhou Tai offered themselves.
They were accepted and orders were issued to the camps to remain ready for
action but not to move till told.
Han Dang and Zhou Tai sailed out each with a small squadron of five ships in
line.
The two braggarts from the north, Jiao Chu and Zhang Neng, really only trusted
to their boldness and luck. Their ships came down under the powerful strokes of
the oars. As they neared, the two leaders put on their heart-protectors,
gripped their spears, and each took his station in the prow of the leading ship
of his division. Jiao Chuâs ship led and as soon as he came near enough, his
troops began to shoot at Han Dang, who fended off the arrows with his buckler.
Jiao Chu twirled his long spear as he engaged his opponent. But, at the first
thrust, he was killed.
His comrade Zhang Neng with the other ships was coming up with great shouts,
when Zhou Tai sailed up at an angle, and these two squadrons began shooting
arrows at each other in clouds. Zhou Tai fended off the arrows with his shield
and stood gripping his sword firmly till his ships came within a few spans of
the enemyâs ships, when he leaped across and cut down Zhang Neng. Zhang
Nengâs dead body fell into the water. Then the battle became confused, and
the attacking ships rowed hard to get away. The southerners pursued but soon
came in sight of Wen Pingâs supporting fleet. Once more the ships engaged and
the forces fought with each other.
Zhou Yu with his officers stood on the summit of a mountain and watched his own
and the enemy ships out on the river. The flags and the ensigns were all in
perfect order. Then he saw Wen Ping and his own fleets engaged in battle, and
soon it was evident that the former was not a match for his own sailors. Wen
Ping turned about to retire, Han Dang and Zhou Tai pursued. Zhou Yu fearing
lest his sailors should go too far, then hoisted the white flag of recall.
To his officers Zhou Yu said, âThe masts of the northern ships stand thick as
reeds. Cao Cao himself is full of wiles. How can we destroy him?â
No one replied, for just then the great yellow flag that flapped in the breeze
in the middle of Cao Caoâs fleet suddenly fell over into the river.
Zhou Yu laughed.
âThat is a bad omen,â said he.
Then an extra violent blast of wind came by, and the waves rose high and beat
upon the bank. A corner of his own flag flicked Zhou Yu on the cheek, and
suddenly a thought flashed through his mind. Zhou Yu uttered a loud cry,
staggered, and fell backward. They picked him up. There was blood upon his
lips, and he was unconscious. Presently, however, he revived.
And once he laughed, then gave a cry,
This is hard to ensure a victory.
Zhou Yuâs fate will appear as the story unfolds.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 49 ****
In the last chapter Zhou Yu was seized with sudden illness as he watched the
fleets of his enemy. He was borne to his tent, and his officers came in
multitudes to inquire after him.
They looked at each other, saying, âWhat a pity our general should be taken
ill, when Cao Caoâs legions threaten so terribly! What would happen if Cao
Cao attacked?â
Messengers with the evil tidings were sent to Sun Quan, while the physicians
did their best for the invalid. Lu Su was particularly sad at the illness of
his patron and went to see Zhuge Liang to talk it over.
âWhat do you make of it?â said Zhuge Liang.
âGood luck for Cao Cao; bad for us,â said Lu Su.
âI could cure him,â said Zhuge Liang laughing.
âIf you could, Wu would be very fortunate,â said Lu Su.
Lu Su prayed Zhuge Liang to go to see the sick man. They went, and Lu Su
entered first. Zhou Yu lay in bed, his head covered by a quilt.
âHow are you, General?â said Lu Su.
âMy heart pains me. Every now and again I feel faint and dizzy.â
âHave you taken any remedies?â
âMy gorge rises at the thought. I could not.â
âI saw Zhuge Liang just now, and he says he could heal you. He is just
outside, and I will call him if you like.â
âAsk him to come in.â
Zhou Yu bade his servants help him to a sitting position, and Zhuge Liang
entered.
âI have not seen you for days,â said Zhuge Liang. âHow could I guess that
you were unwell?â
âHow can anyone feel secure? We are constantly the playthings of luck, good
or bad.â
âYes. Heavenâs winds and clouds are not to be measured. No one can reckon
their comings and goings, can they?â
Zhou Yu turned pale and a low groan escaped him, while his visitor went on,
âYou feel depressed, do you not? As though troubles were piling up in your
heart?â
âThat is exactly how I feel,â said Zhou Yu.
âYou need cooling medicine to dissipate this sense of oppression.â
âI have taken a cooling draught, but it has done no good.â
âYou must get the humors into good order before the drugs will have any
effect.â
Zhou Yu began to think Zhuge Liang knew what was really the matter and resolved
to test him.
âWhat should be taken to produce a favorable temper?â said Zhou Yu.
âI know one means of producing a favorable temper,â replied Zhuge Liang.
âI wish you would tell me.â
Zhuge Liang got out writing materials, sent away the servants, and then wrote a
few words:
âTo defeat Cao Cao
You have to use fire;
All are in your wish,
But wind from the east.â
This he gave to the sick general, saying, âThat is the origin of your
illness.â
Zhou Yu read the words with great surprise, and it confirmed his secret opinion
that Zhuge Liang really was rather more than human. He decided that the only
course was to be open and tell him all.
So he said, âSince you know the cause of the disease, what do you recommend
as treatment? The need of a remedy is very urgent.â
âI have no great talent,â said Zhuge Liang, âbut I have had to do with
humans of no ordinary gifts from whom I have received certain magical books
called âConcealing Methodâ. I can call the winds and summon the rains.
Since you need a southeast breeze, General, you must build an altar on the
Southern Hills, the Altar of the Seven Stars. It must be nine spans high, with
three steps, surrounded by a guard of one hundred and twenty humans bearing
flags. On this altar I will work a spell to procure a strong southeast gale for
three days and three nights. Do you approve?â
âNever mind three whole days,â said Zhou Yu. âOne day of strong wind will
serve my purpose. But it must be done at once and without delay.â
âI will sacrifice for a wind for three days from the twentieth day of the
moon. Will that suit you?â
Zhou Yu was delighted and hastily rose from his couch to give the necessary
orders. He commanded that five hundred men should be sent to the mountains to
build the altar, and he told off the guard of one hundred and twenty to bear
the flags and be at the orders of Zhuge Liang.
Zhuge Liang took his leave, went forth, and rode off with Lu Su to the
mountains where they measured out the ground. He bade the soldiers build the
altar of red earth from the southeast quarter. It was two hundred and forty
spans in circuit, square in shape, and of three tiers, each of three spans, in
all nine spans high.
On the lowest tier he placed the flags of the twenty-eight âhousesâ of the
heavens and four constellations: On the east seven, with blue flags; on the
north seven, with black flags; on the west seven, with white flags; and on the
south seven, with red flags.
Around the second tier he placed sixty-four yellow flags, corresponding to the
number of the diagrams of the Book of Divination, in eight groups of eight.
Four men were stationed on the highest platform, each wearing a Daoist
headdress and a black silk robe embroidered with the phoenix and confined with
wide sashes. They wore scarlet boots and square-cut skirts. On the left front
stood a man supporting a tall pole bearing at its top a plume of light feathers
to show by their least movement the windâs first breathing. On the right
front was a man holding a tall pole whereon was a flag with the symbol of the
seven stars to show the direction and force of the wind. On the left rear stood
a man with a sword, and on the right rear a man with a censer.
Below the altar were forty-four men holding flags, umbrellas, spears, lances,
yellow banners, white axes, red banderoles, and black ensigns. And these were
spaced about the altar.
On the appointed day Zhuge Liang, having chosen a propitious moment, bathed his
body and purified himself. Then he robed himself as a Daoist, loosened his
locks, and approached the altar.
He bade Lu Su retire, saying, âReturn to the camp and assist the General in
setting out his forces. Should my prayers avail not, do not wonder.â
So Lu Su left him. Then Zhuge Liang commanded the guards on no account to
absent themselves, to maintain strict silence, and to be reverent. Death would
be the penalty of disobedience.
Next, with solemn steps he ascended the altar, faced the proper quarter,
lighted the incense, and sprinkled the water in the basins. This done he gazed
into the heavens and prayed silently. The prayer ended he descended and
returned to his tent. After a brief rest he allowed the soldiers by turns to go
away to eat.
Thrice that day he ascended the altar and thrice descended, but there was no
sign of the wind.
During that time, Zhou Yu, with Cheng Pu and Lu Su and other military officials
on duty, sat waiting in the tent till the wished-for wind should blow and the
attack could be launched. Messengers were also sent to Sun Quan to prepare to
support the forward movement.
Huang Gai had his fire ships ready, twenty of them. The fore parts of the ships
were thickly studded with large nails, and they were loaded with dry reeds,
wood soaked in fish oil, and covered with sulfur, saltpeter, and other
inflammables. The ships were covered in with black oiled cloth. In the prow of
each was a black dragon flag with indentations. A fighting ship was attached to
the stern of each to propel it forward. All were ready and awaited orders to
move.
Meanwhile Cao Caoâs two spies, Cai He and Cai Zhong, were being guarded
carefully in an outer camp far from the river bank and daily entertained with
feasting. They were not allowed to know of the preparations. The watch was so
close that not a trickle of information reached the prisoners.
Presently, while Zhou Yu was anxiously awaiting in his tent for the desired
wind, a messenger came to say that Sun Quan had anchored at a place thirty
miles from the camp, where he awaited news from the Commander-in-Chief.
Lu Su was sent to warn all the various commanders to be ready, the ships and
their weapons, sails and oars, all for instant use, and to impress upon them
the penalties of being caught unprepared. The soldiers were indeed ready for
the fight and yearning for the fray.
But the sky remained obstinately clear, and as night drew nigh no breath of air
stirred.
âWe have been cajoled,â said Zhou Yu. âIndeed what possibility is there
of a southeast wind in midwinter?â
âZhuge Liang would not use vain and deceitful words,â replied Lu Su.
Towards the third watch, the sound of a movement arose in the air. Soon the
flags fluttered out. And when the Commander-in-Chief went out to make sure, he
saw they were flowing toward the northwest. In a very short time the southeast
wind was in full force.
Zhou Yu was, however, frightened at the power of the man whose help he had
invoked.
He said, âReally the man has power over the heavens and authority over the
earth. His methods are incalculable, beyond the ken of god or devil. He cannot
be allowed to live to be a danger to our land of the south. We must slay him
soon to fend off later evils.â
So Zhou Yu resolved to commit a crime to remove his dangerous rival.
He called two of the generals of his guard, Ding Feng and Xu Sheng, and said to
them, âEach of you take a party of one hundred troops, one along the river,
the other along the road, to the altar on the mountains. As soon as you get
there, without asking questions or giving reasons, you are to seize and behead
Zhuge Liang. Rich reward will be given when you bring his head back.â
Xu Sheng and Ding Feng went off on their errand, the former leading dagger and
ax-men going as fast as oars could propel them along the river, the latter at
the head of archers and bowmen on horseback. The southeast wind buffeted them
as they went on their way.
High was raised the Seven Stars Altar,
On it prayed the Sleeping Dragon
For an eastern wind, and straightway
Blew the wind. Had not the wizard
Exercised his mighty magic
Nought had Zhou Yuâs skill availed.
Ding Feng first arrived. He saw the guards with their flags, dropped off his
steed, and marched to the altar, sword in hand. But he found no Zhuge Liang.
When he asked the guards, they told him, saying, âHe has just gone down.â
Ding Feng ran down the hill to search. There he met his fellow Xu Sheng, and
they joined forces.
Presently a simple soldier told them, saying, âThe evening before a small,
fast boat anchored there near a sand spit, and Zhuge Liang was seen to go on
board. Then the boat went up river.â
So Xu Sheng and Ding Feng divided their party into two, one to go by water, the
other by land.
Xu Sheng bade his boatmen put on all sail and take every advantage of the wind.
Before very long he saw the fugitiveâs boat ahead, and when near enough,
stood in the prow of his own and shouted, âDo not flee, O Instructor of the
Army! The General requests your presence.â
Zhuge Liang, who was seated in the stern of his boat, just laughed aloud,
saying, âReturn and tell the General to make good use of his soldiers. Tell
him I am going up river for a spell and will see him again another day.â
âPray wait a little while,â cried Xu Sheng. âI have something most
important to tell you!â
âI knew all about it, that Zhou Yu would not let me go and that he wanted to
kill me. That is why Zhao Zilong was waiting for me. You had better not
approach nearer.â
Seeing the other ship had no sail, Xu Sheng thought he would assuredly come up
with it and so maintained the pursuit.
Then when he got too close, Zhao Zilong fitted an arrow to the bowstring and,
standing up in the stern of his boat, cried, âYou know who I am, and I came
expressly to escort the Directing Instructor. Why are you pursuing him? One
arrow would kill you, only that would cause a breach of the peace between two
houses. I will shoot and just give you a specimen of my skill.â
With that he shot, and the arrow whizzed overhead cutting the rope that held up
the sail. Down came the sail trailing in the water and the boat swung round.
Then Zhao Zilongâs boat hoisted its sail, and the fair wind speedily carried
it out of sight.
On the bank stood Ding Feng. He bade his comrade come to the shore and said,
âZhuge Liang is too clever for anyone; and Zhao Zilong is bravest of the
brave. You remember what he did at Dangyang, at the Long Slope Bridge. All we
can do is to return and report.â
So they returned to camp and told their master about the preparations that
Zhuge Liang had made to ensure safety. Zhou Yu was indeed puzzled at the depth
of his rivalâs insight.
âI shall have no peace day or night while he lives,â said Zhou Yu.
âAt least wait till Cao Cao is done with,â said Lu Su.
And Zhou Yu knew Lu Su spoke wisely.
Having summoned the leaders to receive orders, first Zhou Yu gave orders to Gan
Ning: âTake with you the false deserter Cai Zhong and his soldiers, and go
along the south bank, showing the flags of Cao Cao, till you reach the Black
Forest just opposite the enemyâs main store of grain and forage. Then you are
to penetrate as deeply as possible into the enemyâs lines and light a torch
as a signal. Cai He is to be kept in camp for another purpose.â
The next order was: âTaishi Ci is to lead two thousand troops as quickly as
possible to Huangzhou and cut the enemyâs communications with Hefei. When
near the enemy, he is to give a signal. If he sees a red flag, he will know
that our lord, Sun Quan, is at hand with reinforcements.â
Gan Ning and Taishi Ci had the farthest to go and started first.
Then Lu Meng was sent into the Black Forest with three thousand troops as a
support to Gan Ning who was ordered to set fire to Cao Caoâs depot. A fourth
party of three thousand troops was led by Ling Tong to the borders of Yiling
and attack as soon as the signal from the forest was seen. A fifth party of
three thousand under Dong Xi went to Hanyang to fall upon the enemy along the
River Han. Their signal was a white flag; and a sixth division of three
thousand commanded by Pan Zhang would support them.
When these six parties had gone off. Huang Gai got ready his fire ships and
sent a soldier with a note to tell Cao Cao that he was coming over that
evening. Four naval squadrons were told off to support Huang Gai.
The four squadrons, each of three hundred ships, were placed under four
commanders: Han Dang, Zhou Tai, Jiang Qin, and Chen Wu. Twenty fire ships
preceded each fleet. Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu went on board one of the large ships
to direct the battle. Their guards were Ding Feng and Xu Sheng. Lu Su, Kan Ze,
and the advisers were left to guard the camp. Cheng Pu was greatly impressed
with Zhou Yuâs ordering of the grand attack.
Then came a messenger bearing a mandate from Sun Quan making Lu Xun Leader of
the Van. He was ordered to go to Qichun. Sun Quan himself would support Lu Xun.
Zhou Yu also sent two command units, one to the Western Hills to make fire
signals, and the other to the Southern Hills to hoist flags.
So all being prepared they waited for dusk.
Liu Bei was at Xiakou anxiously awaiting the return of his adviser. Then
appeared a fleet, led by Liu Qi, who had come to find out how matters were
progressing.
Liu Bei sent to call him to the battle tower and said, âThe southeast wind
had begun to blow, and that Zhao Zilong had gone to meet Zhuge Liang.â
Not long after a single sail was seen coming up before the wind, and Liu Bei
knew it was Zhuge Liang, the Directing Instructor of the Army.
So Liu Bei and Liu Qi went down to meet the boat. Soon the vessel reached the
shore, and Zhuge Liang and Zhao Zilong disembarked.
Liu Bei was very glad, and after they had inquired after each otherâs well-
being, Zhuge Liang said, âThere is no time to tell of any other things now.
Are the soldiers and ships ready?â
âThey have long been ready,â replied Liu Bei. âThey only await you to
direct how they are to be used.â
The three then went to the tent and took their seats.
Zhuge Liang at once began to issue orders: âZhao Zilong, with three thousand
troops is to cross the river and go to the Black Forest by the minor road. He
will choose a dense jungle and prepare an ambush. Tonight, after the fourth
watch, Cao Cao will hurry along that way. When half his troops have passed, the
jungle is to be fired. Cao Cao will not be wholly destroyed but many will
perish.â
âThere are two roads,â said Zhao Zilong. âOne leads to the southern
regions and the other to Jingzhou. I do not know by which he will come.â
âThe south road is too dangerous. Cao Cao will certainly pass along the
Jingzhou road, so that he may get away to Xuchang.â
Then Zhao Zilong went away.
Next Zhuge Liang said to Zhang Fei, âYou will take three thousand troops over
the river to cut the road to Yiling. You will ambush in the Hulu Valley. Cao
Cao, not daring to go to South Yiling, will go to North Yiling. Tomorrow, after
the rain, he will halt to refresh his troops. As soon as the smoke is seen to
rise from their cooking fires, you will fire the hill side. You will not
capture Cao Cao, but you will render excellent service.â
So Zhang Fei left. Next was called Mi Zhu, Mi Fang, and Liu Feng. They were to
take command of three squadrons and go along the river to collect beaten
soldiers and their weapons.
The three left. Then Zhuge Liang said to Liu Qi, âThe country around Wuchang
is very important, and I wish you to take command of your own troops and
station them at strategic points. Cao Cao, being defeated, will flee thither,
and you will capture him. But you are not to leave the city without the best of
reasons.â
And Liu Qi took leave.
Then Zhuge Liang said to Liu Bei, âI wish you to remain quietly and calmly in
Fankou, in a high tower, to watch Zhou Yu work out his great scheme this
night.â
All this time Guan Yu has been silently waiting his turn, but Zhuge Liang said
no word to him.
When Guan Yu could bear this no longer, he cried, âSince I first followed my
brother to battle many years ago, I have never been left behind. Now that great
things are afoot, is there no work for me? What is meant by it?â
âYou should not be surprised. I wanted you for service at a most important
point, only that there was a something standing in the way that prevented me
from sending you,â said Zhuge Liang.
âWhat could stand in the way? I wish you would tell me.â
âYou see Cao Cao was once very kind to you, and you cannot help feeling
grateful. Now when his soldiers have been beaten, he will have to flee along
the Huarong Road. If I sent you to guard it, you would have to let him pass. So
I will not send you.â
âYou are most considerate, Instructor. But though it is true that he treated
me well, yet I slew two of his most redoubtable opponents, Yan Liang and Wen
Chou, by way of repayment, beside raising a siege. If I happened upon him on
this occasion, I should hardly let him go.â
âBut what if you did?â
âYou could deal with me by military rules.â
âThen put that in writing.â
So Guan Yu wrote a formal undertaking and gave the document to Zhuge Liang.
âWhat happens if Cao Cao does not pass that way?â said Guan Yu.
âI will give you a written engagement that he will pass.â Then Zhuge Liang
continued, âOn the hills by the Huarong Valley, you are to raise a heap of
wood and grass to make a great column of smoke and mislead Cao Cao into
coming.â
âIf Cao Cao sees a smoke, he will suspect an ambush and will not come,â
said Guan Yu.
âYou are very simple,â said Zhuge Liang. âDo you not know more of warâs
ruses than that? Cao Cao is an able leader, but you can deceive him this time.
When he sees the smoke, he will take it as a subterfuge and risk going that
way. But do not let your kindness of heart rule your conduct.â
Thus was his duty assigned Guan Yu, and he left, taking his adopted son Guan
Ping, his general Zhou Cang, and five hundred swordsmen.
Said Liu Bei, âHis sense of rectitude is very profound. I fear if Cao Cao
should come that way, my brother will let him pass.â
âI have consulted the stars lately, and the rebel Cao Cao is not fated to
come to his end yet. I have purposely designed this manifestation of kindly
feeling for Guan Yu to accomplish and so act handsomely.â
âIndeed there are few such far-seeing humans as you are,â said Liu Bei.
The two then went to Fankou whence they might watch Zhou Yuâs evolutions. Sun
Qian and Jian Yong were left on guard of Xiakou.
Cao Cao was in his great camp in conference with his advisers and awaiting the
arrival of Huang Gai. The southeast wind was very strong that day, and Cheng Yu
was insisting on the necessity for precaution.
But Cao Cao laughed, saying, âThe Winter Solstice depends upon the sun and
nothing else. There is sure to be a southeast wind at some one or other of its
recurrences. I see nothing to wonder at.â
Just then they announced the arrival of a small boat from the other shore with
a letter from Huang Gai. The bearer of the letter was brought in and presented
it. Cao Cao read it:
âZhou Yu has kept such strict watch that there has been no chance of escape.
But now some grain is coming down river, and I, Huang Gai, have been named as
Escort Commander which will give me the opportunity I desire. I will slay one
of the known generals and bring his head as an offering when I come. This
evening at the third watch, if boats are seen with dragon toothed flags, they
will be the grain boats.â
This letter delighted Cao Cao who, with his officers, went to the naval camp
and boarded a great ship to watch for the arrival of Huang Gai.
In the South Land, when evening fell, Zhou Yu sent for Cai He and bade the
soldiers bind him.
The unhappy man protested, saying, âI have committed no crime!â
But Zhou Yu said, âWhat sort of a fellow are you, think you, to come and
pretend to desert to my side? I need a small sacrifice for my flag, and your
head will serve my purpose. So I am going to use it.â
Cai He being at the end of his tether unable to deny the charge suddenly cried,
âTwo of your own side, Kan Ze and Gan Ning, are also in the plot!â
âUnder my directions!â said Zhou Yu.
Cai He was exceedingly repentant and sad, but Zhou Yu bade them take Cai He to
the river bank where the black standard had been set up and there, after the
pouring of a libation and the burning of paper, Cai He was beheaded, his blood
being a sacrifice to the flag.
This ceremony over, the ships started, and Huang Gai took his place on the
third ship. He merely wore breast armor and carried a keen blade. On his flag
were written four large characters Van Leader Huang Gai. With a fair wind his
fleet sailed toward the Red Cliffs.
The wind was strong and the waves ran high. Cao Cao in the midst of the central
squadron eagerly scanned the river which rolled down under the bright moon like
a silver serpent writhing in innumerable folds. Letting the wind blow full in
his face, Cao Cao laughed aloud for he was now to obtain his desire.
Then a soldier pointing to the river said, âThe whole south is one mass of
sails, and they are coming up on the wind.â
Cao Cao went to a higher point and gazed at the sails intently, and his
officers told him that the flags were black and dragon shaped, and indented,
and among them there flew one very large banner on which was a name Huang Gai.
âThat is my friend, the deserter!â said he joyfully. âHeaven is on my
side today.â
As the ships drew closer, Cheng Yu said, âThose ships are treacherous. Do not
let them approach the camp.â
âHow know you that?â asked Cao Cao.
And Cheng Yu replied, âIf they were laden with grain, they would lie deep in
the water. But these are light and float easily. The southeast wind is very
strong, and if they intend treachery, how can we defend ourselves?â
Cao Cao began to understand. Then he asked who would go out to stop the
approaching fleet, and Wen Ping volunteered, saying, âI am well used to the
waters.â
Thereupon Wen Ping sprang into a small light craft and sailed out, followed by
ten cruisers which came at his signal.
Standing in the prow of his ship, Wen Ping called out to those advancing toward
them, âYou southern ships are not to approach! Such are the orders of the
Prime Minister. Stop there in mid stream!â
The soldiers all yelled to them to lower their sails. The shout had not died
away when a bowstring twanged, and Wen Ping rolled down into the ship with an
arrow in the left arm. Confusion reigned on his ship, and all the others
hurried back to their camp.
When the ships were about a mile of distant, Huang Gai waved his sword and the
leading ships broke forth into fire, which, under the force of the strong wind,
soon gained strength and the ships became as fiery arrows. Soon the whole
twenty dashed into the naval camp.
All Cao Caoâs ships were gathered there, and as they were firmly chained
together not one could escape from the others and flee. There was a roar of
bombs and fireships came on from all sides at once. The face of the three
rivers was speedily covered with fire which flew before the wind from one ship
to another. It seemed as if the universe was filled with flame.
Cao Cao hastened toward the shore. Huang Gai, with a few troops at his back,
leaped into a small boat, dashed through the fire, and sought Cao Cao. Cao Cao,
seeing the imminence of the danger, was making for the land. Zhang Liao got
hold of a small boat into which he helped his master; none too soon, for the
ship was burning. They got Cao Cao out of the thick of the fire and dashed for
the bank.
Huang Gai, seeing a handsomely robed person get into a small boat, guessed it
must be Cao Cao and pursued.
He drew very near and he held his keen blade ready to strike, crying out,
âYou rebel! Do not flee. I am Huang Gai.â
Cao Cao howled in the bitterness of his distress. Zhang Liao fitted an arrow to
his bow and aimed at the pursuer, shooting at short range. The roaring of the
gale and the flames kept Huang Gai from hearing the twang of the string, and he
was wounded in the shoulder. He fell and rolled over into the water.
He fell in peril of water
When flames were high;
Ere cudgel bruises had faded,
An arrow struck.
Huang Gaiâs fate will be told in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 50 ****
The last chapter closed with Huang Gai in the water wounded, Cao Cao rescued
from immediate danger, and confusion rampant among the soldiers. Pressing
forward to attack the naval camp, Han Dang was told by his soldiers that
someone was clinging to the rudder of his boat and shouting to him by his
familiar name. Han Dang listened carefully and in the voice at once he
recognized that Huang Gai was calling to him for help.
âThat is my friend Huang Gai!â cried he, and they quickly pulled the
wounded leader out of the water.
Then they saw Huang Gai was wounded for the arrow still stuck. Han Dang bit out
the shaft of the arrow but the point was deeply buried in the flesh. They
hastily pulled off his wet garments and cut out the metal arrowhead with a
dagger, tore up one of the flags, and bound up the wound. Then Han Dang gave
Huang Gai his own fighting robe to put on and sent him off in a small boat back
to camp.
Huang Gaiâs escape from drowning must be taken as proof of his natural
affinity for, or sympathy with, water. Although it was the period of great cold
and he was heavy with armor when he fell into the river, yet he escaped with
life.
In this great battle at the junction of the three rivers, the Three Gorges,
when fire seemed to spread wide over all the wide surface of the water, when
the earth quaked with the roar of battle, when land forces closed in on both
wings and four battle squadrons advanced on the front, when the ferocity of
fire answered the clash of weapons and weapons were aided by fire, under the
thrusts of spears and the flights of arrows, burnt by fire and drowned by
water, Cao Cao lost an incalculable number of troops. And a poet wrote:
When Wei and Wu together strove
For the mastery,
In the Red Cliffs fight the tall ships
Vanished from the sea,
For there the fierce flames, leaping high.
Burned them utterly.
So Zhou Yu for his liege lord
Got the victory.
And another poem runs:
The hills are high, the moon shines faint.
The waters stretch afar;
I sigh to think how oft this land
Has suffered stress of war;
And I recall how southerners
Shrank from the northern armyâs might,
And how a favoring eastern gale
Helped them to win the fight.
While fire was consuming the naval base of Cao Cao, Gan Ning made Cai Zhong
guide him into the innermost recesses of Cao Caoâs camp. Then Gan Ning slew
Cai Zhong with one slash of his sword. After this Gan Ning set fire to the
jungle; and at this signal, Lu Meng put fire to the grass in ten places near to
each other. Then other fires were started, and the noise of battle was on all
sides.
Cao Cao and Zhang Liao, with a small party of horsemen, fled through the
burning forest. They could see no road in front; all seemed on fire. Presently
Mao Jie and Wen Ping, with a few more horsemen, joined them. Cao Cao bade the
soldiers seek a way through.
Zhang Liao pointed out, saying, âThe only suitable road is through the Black
Forest.â
And they took it.
They had gone but a short distance when they were overtaken by a small party of
the enemy, and a voice cried, âCao Cao, stop!â
It was Lu Meng, whose ensign soon appeared against the fiery background. Cao
Cao urged his small party of fugitives forward, bidding Zhang Liao defend him
from Lu Meng.
Soon after Cao Cao saw the light of torches in front, and from a gorge there
rushed out another force. And the leader cried, âLing Tong is here!â
Cao Cao was scared. His liver and gall both seemed torn from within.
But just then on his half right, he saw another company approach and heard a
cry, âFear not, O Prime Minister, I am here to rescue you!â
The speaker was Xu Huang, and he attacked the pursuers and held them off.
A move to the north seemed to promise escape, but soon they saw a camp on a
hill top. Xu Huang went ahead to reconnoiter and found the officers in command
were Cao Caoâs Generals Ma Yan and Zhang Zi, who had once been in the service
of Yuan Shao. They had three thousand of northern soldiers in camp. They had
seen the sky redden with the flames, but knew not what was afoot so dared make
no move.
This turned out lucky for Cao Cao who now found himself with a fresh force. He
sent Ma Yan and Zhang Zi, with a thousand troops, to clear the road ahead while
the others remained as guard. And he felt much more secure.
The two went forward, but before they had gone very far, they heard a shouting
and a party of soldiers came out, the leader of them shouting, âI am Gan Ning
of Wu!â
Nothing daunted the two leaders, but the redoubtable Gan Ning cut down Ma Yan.
And when his brother warrior Zhang Zi set his spear and dashed forward, he too
fell beneath a stroke from the fearsome sword of Gan Ning. Both leaders dead,
the soldiers fled to give Cao Cao the bad news.
At this time Cao Cao expected aid from Hefei, for he knew not that Sun Quan was
barring the road. But when Sun Quan saw the fires and so knew that his soldiers
had won the day, he ordered Lu Xun to give the answering signal. Taishi Ci
seeing this came down and his force joined up with that of Lu Xun, and they
went against Cao Cao.
As for Cao Cao, he could only get away toward Yiling. On the road Cao Cao fell
in with Zhang He and ordered him to protect the retreat. Cao Cao pressed on as
quickly as possible.
At the fifth watch he was a long way from the glare and he felt safer. He
asked, âWhat is this place?â
They told him, âIt is west of the Black Forest and north of Yidu.â
Seeing the thickly crowded trees all about him, and the steep hills and narrow
passes, Cao Cao threw up his head and laughed.
Those about him asked, âWhy are you, Sir, so merry?â
And he said, âI am only laughing at the stupidity of Zhou Yu and the
ignorance of Zhuge Liang. If they have only set an ambush there, as I would
have done, why, there is no escape.â
Cao Cao had scarcely finished his explanation when from both sides came a
deafening roll of drums and flames sprang up to heaven. Cao Cao nearly fell off
his horse â-he was so startled.
And from the side dashed in a troop, with Zhao Zilong leading, who cried, âI
am Zhao Zilong, and long have I been waiting here!â
Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang and Zhang He to engage this new opponent, and he
himself rode off into the smoke and fire. Zhao Zilong did not pursue; he only
captured the banners, and Cao Cao escaped.
The faint light of dawn showed a great black cloud all around, for the
southeast wind had not ceased. Suddenly began a heavy downpour of rain, wetting
everyone to the skin, but still Cao Cao maintained his headlong flight till the
starved faces of the soldiers made a halt imperative. He told the men to forage
in the villages about for grain and the means of making a fire. But when these
had been found and they began to cook a meal, another pursuing party came
along, and Cao Cao again was terrified. However, these proved to be Li Dian and
Xu Chu escorting some of his advisers whom he saw with joy.
When giving the order to advance again, Cao Cao asked, âWhat places lay
ahead?â
They told him, âThere are two roads. One was the highway to South Yiling, and
the other a mountain road to North Yiling.â
âWhich is the shorter way to Jiangling?â asked Cao Cao.
âThe best way is to take the south road through Hulu Valley,â was the
reply.
So Cao Cao gave orders to march that way. By the time Hulu Valley was reached,
the soldiers were almost starving and could march no more; horses too were worn
out. Many had fallen by the roadside. A halt was then made, food was taken by
force from the villagers, and as there were still some boilers left, they found
a dry spot beside the hills where they could rest and cook. And there they
began to prepare a meal, boiling grain, and roasting strips of horse flesh.
Then they took off their wet clothes and spread them to dry. The beasts, too,
were unsaddled and turned out to graze.
Seated comfortably in a somewhat open spot, Cao Cao suddenly looked up and
began to laugh loud and long.
His companions, remembering the sequel of his last laugh, said, âNot long
since, Sir, you laughed at Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang. That resulted in the
arrival of Zhao Zilong and great loss of troops to us. Why do you now laugh?â
âI am laughing again at the ignorance of the same two men. If I were in their
place, and conducting their campaign, I should have had an ambush here, just to
meet us when we were tired out. Then, even if we escaped with our lives, we
should suffer very severely. They did not see this, and therefore I am laughing
at them.â
Even at that moment behind them rose a great yell. Thoroughly startled, Cao Cao
threw aside his breastplate and leaped upon his horse. Most of the soldiers
failed to catch theirs, and then fires sprang up on every side and filled the
mouth of the valley. A force was arrayed before them and at the head was the
man of ancient Yan, Zhang Fei, seated on his steed with his great spear
leveled.
âWhither would you flee, O rebel?â shouted he.
The soldiers grew cold within at the sight of the terrible warrior. Xu Chu,
mounted on a bare-backed horse, rode up to engage him, and Zhang Liao and Xu
Huang galloped up to his aid. The three gathered about Zhang Fei and a melee
began, while Cao Cao made off at top speed. The other leaders set off after
him, and Zhang Fei pursued. However, Cao Cao by dint of hard riding got away,
and gradually the pursuers were out-distanced. But many had received wounds.
As they were going. the soldiers said, âThere are two roads before us. Which
shall we take?â
âWhich is the shorter?â asked Cao Cao.
âThe high road is the more level, but it is fifteen miles longer than the bye
road which goes to Huarong Valley. Only the latter road is narrow and
dangerous, full of pits and difficult.â
Cao Cao sent men up to the hill tops to look around.
They returned, saying: âThere are several columns of smoke rising from the
hills along the bye road. The high road seems quiet.â
Then Cao Cao bade them lead the way along the bye road.
âWhere smoke arises there are surely soldiers,â remarked the officers.
âWhy go this way?â
âBecause the âBook of Warâ says that the hollow is to be regarded as
solid, and the solid as hollow. That fellow Zhuge Liang is very subtle and has
sent people to make those fires so that we should not go that way. He has laid
an ambush on the high road. I have made up my mind, and I will not fall a
victim to his wiles.â
âO Prime Minister, your conclusions are most admirable. None other can equal
you,â said the officers.
And the soldiers were sent along the bye road. They were very hungry and many
almost too weak to travel. The horses too were spent. Some had been scorched by
the flames, and they rode forward resting their heads on their whips. The
wounded struggled on to the last of their strength. All were soaking wet and
all were feeble. Their arms and accouterments were in a deplorable state, and
more than half had been left upon the road they had traversed. Few of the
horses had saddles or bridles, for in the confusion of pursuit they had been
left behind. It was the time of greatest winter cold, and the suffering was
indescribable.
Noticing that the leading party had stopped, Cao Cao sent to ask the reason.
The messenger returned, saying, âThe rain water collected in the pits makes
the ground a mire, and the horses cannot not move.â
Cao Cao raged. He said, âWhen soldiers come to hills, they cut a road; when
they happen upon streams, they bridge them. Such a thing as mud cannot stay an
army.â
So he ordered the weak and wounded to go to the rear and come on as they could,
while the robust and able were to cut down trees, and gather herbage and reeds
to fill up the holes. And it was to be done without delay, or death would be
the punishment of the disobedient or remiss.
So the soldiers dismounted and felled trees and cut bamboos, and they leveled
the road. And because of the imminence and fear of pursuit, a party of one
hundred under Zhang Liao, Xu Chu, and Xu Huang was told off to hasten the
workers and slay any that idled.
The soldiers made their way along the shallower parts, but many fell, and cries
of misery were heard the whole length of the way.
âWhat are you howling for?â cried Cao Cao. âThe number of your days is
fixed by fate. Anyone who howls shall be put to death.â
The remnant of the army, now divided into three, one to march slowly, a second
to fill up the waterways and hollows, and a third to escort Cao Cao, gradually
made its way over the precipitous road. When the going improved a little and
the path was moderately level, Cao Cao turned to look at his following and saw
he had barely three hundred soldiers. And these lacked clothing and armor and
were tattered and disordered.
But he pressed on, and when the officers told him the horses were quite spent
and must rest, he replied, âPress on to Jingzhou, and there we shall find
repose.â
So they pressed on. But they had gone only one or two miles when Cao Cao
flourished his whip and broke once again into loud laughter.
âWhat is there to laugh at?â asked the officers.
âPeople say those two, Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang, are able and crafty. I do not
see it. They are a couple of incapables. If an ambush had been placed here, we
should all be prisoners.â
Cao Cao had not finished this speech when the explosion of a bomb broke the
silence, and a company of five hundred troops with swords in their hands
appeared and barred the way. The leader was Guan Yu, holding his green-dragon
saber, bestriding the Red Hare. At this sight, the spirits of Cao Caoâs
soldiers left them, and they gazed into each othersâ faces in panic.
âNow we have but one course,â said Cao Cao. âWe must fight to the
death!â
âHow can we?â said the officers. âThough the leaders may have some
strength left, the horses are spent.â
Cheng Yu said, âI have always heard that Guan Yu is haughty to the proud but
kindly to the humble; he despises the strong, but is gentle with the weak. He
discriminates between love and hate and is always righteous and true. You, O
Prime Minister, have shown him kindness in the past. If you will remind him of
that, we shall escape this evil.â
Cao Cao agreed to try. He rode out to the front, bowed low and said,
âGeneral, I trust you have enjoyed good health.â
âI had orders to await you, O Prime Minister,â replied Guan Yu, bowing in
return, âand I have been expecting you these many days.â
âYou see before you one Cao Cao â-defeated and weak. I have reached a sad
pass, and I trust you, O General, will not forget the kindness of former
days.â
âThough indeed you were kind to me in those days, yet I slew your enemies for
you and relieved the siege of Baima. As to the business of today, I cannot
allow private feelings to outweigh public duty.â
âDo you remember my six generals, slain at the five passes? The noble person
values righteousness. You are well versed in the histories and must recall the
action of Yu Gong, the archer, when he released his master Zi Zhuo, for he
determined not to use Zi Zhuoâs teaching to kill Zi Zhuo.â
Guan Yu was indeed a very mountain of goodness and could not forget the great
kindness he had received at Cao Caoâs hands, and the magnanimity Cao Cao had
shown over the deeds at the five passes. He saw the desperate straits to which
his benefactor was reduced, and tears were very near to the eyes of both. He
could not press Cao Cao hard.
He pulled at the bridle of his steed and turned away saying to his followers,
âBreak up the formation!â
From this it was evident that his design was to release Cao Cao, who then went
on with his officers. When Guan Yu turned to look back, they had all passed. He
uttered a great shout, and Cao Caoâs soldiers jumped off their horses and
knelt on the ground crying for mercy. But he also had pity for them. Then Zhang
Liao, whom he knew well, came along and was allowed to go free also.
Cao Cao, his army lost, fled to the Huarong Valley;
There in the throat of the gorge met he Guan Yu.
Grateful was Guan Yu, and mindful of former kindness,
Wherefore slipped he the bolt and freed the imprisoned dragon.
Having escaped this danger, Cao Cao hastened to get out of the valley. As the
throat opened out, he glanced behind him and saw only forty-seven horsemen. As
evening fell, they reached Jiangling, and they came upon an army that they took
to be more enemies.
Cao Cao thought the end had surely come, but to his delight they were his own
soldiers and he regained all his confidence.
Cao Ren, who was the leader, said, âI heard of your misfortunes, my lord, but
I was afraid to venture far from my charge, else I would have met you
before.â
âI thought I would never see you again,â said Cao Cao.
The fugitives found repose in the city, where Zhang Liao soon joined them. He
also praised the magnanimity of Guan Yu.
When Cao Cao mustered the miserable remnant of his officers, he found nearly
all were wounded and he bade them rest. Cao Ren poured the wine of consolation
whereby his master might forget his sorrows.
As Cao Cao drank among his familiars, he became exceedingly sad.
Wherefore they said, âO Prime Minister, when you were in the cave of the
tiger and trying to escape, you showed no sign of sorrow. Now that you are safe
in a city, where you have food and the horses have forage, where all you have
to do is to prepare for revenge, suddenly you lose heart and grieve. Why
thus?â
Replied Cao Cao, âI am thinking of my friend Guo Jia: Had he been alive, he
would not have let me suffer this loss.â
He beat his breast and wept, saying, âAlas for Guo Jia! I grieve for Guo Jia!
I sorrow for Guo Jia!â
The reproach shamed the advisers, who were silent.
Next day Cao Cao called Cao Ren and said, âI am going to the capital to
prepare another army for revenge. You are to guard this region and, in case of
necessity, I leave with you a sealed plan. You are only to open the cover when
hard-pressed, and then you are to act as directed. The South Land will not dare
to look this way.â
âWho is to guard Hefei and Xiangyang?â
âJingzhou is particularly your care, and Xiahou Dun is to hold Xiangyang. As
Hefei is most important, I am sending Zhang Liao thither with good aids of Li
Dian and Yue Jing. If you get into difficulties, send at once to tell me.â
Having made these dispositions, Cao Cao set off at once with a few followers.
He took with him the officers who had come over to his side when Jingzhou fell
into his hands.
Cao Ren placed Cao Hong in charge of Yiling and Jiangling.
After having allowed the escape of Cao Cao, Guan Yu found his way back to
headquarters. By this time the other detachments had returned bringing spoil of
horses and weapons and supplies of all kinds. Only Guan Yu came back empty-
handed. When he arrived, Zhuge Liang was with his brother congratulating him on
his success. When Guan Yu was announced, Zhuge Liang got up and went to welcome
him, bearing a cup of wine.
âJoy! O General,â said Zhuge Liang. âYou have done a deed that overtops
the world. You have removed the empireâs worst foe and ought to have been met
at a distance and felicitated.â
Guan Yu muttered inaudibly, and Zhuge Liang continued, âI hope it is not
because we have omitted to welcome you on the road that you seem sad.â
Turning to those about him, Zhuge Liang said, âWhy did you not tell us Guan
Yu was coming?â
âI am here to ask for death,â said Guan Yu.
âSurely Cao Cao came through the valley?â
âYes, he came that way. But I could not help it: I let him go.â
âThen whom have you captured?â
âNo one.â
âThen you remembered the old kindness of Cao Cao and so allowed him to
escape. But your acceptance of the task with its conditions is here. You will
have to suffer the penalty.â
Zhuge Liang called in the lictors and told them to take away Guan Yu and put
him to death.
Guan Yu risked life when he spared
Cao Cao in direst need,
And age-long admiration gained
For kindly deed.
What actually befell will he seen in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 51 ****
Liang, âWe three pledged ourselves to live and die together. Although my
brother Guan Yu has offended, I cannot bear to break our oath. I hope you will
only record this against him and let him atone later for the fault by some
specially meritorious service.â
So the sentence was remitted.
In the meantime, Zhou Yu mustered his officers and called over his soldiers,
noted the special services of each, and sent full reports to his master. The
soldiers who had surrendered were all transported across the river. All this
done they spread the feast of victory.
The next step was to attack and capture Nanjun. The van of the army camped on
the river bank. There were five camps and the Commander-in-Chiefâs tent was
in the center. He summoned his officers to a council. At this moment Sun Qian
arrived with congratulations from Liu Bei.
Zhou Yu received him and, having saluted in proper form, Sun Qian said, âMy
lord sent me on this special mission to felicitate the General on his great
virtue and offer some unworthy gifts.â
âWhere is Liu Bei?â asked Zhou Yu.
âHe is now encamped at Youkou, the mouth of River You.â
âIs Zhuge Liang there?â asked Zhou Yu, taken aback.
âBoth are there,â said Sun Qian.
âThen return quickly, and I will come in person to thank them.â
The presents handed over, Sun Qian was sent back forthwith to his own camp.
Then Lu Su asked Zhou Yu why he had started when he heard where Liu Bei was
camped.
âBecause,â replied Zhou Yu, âcamping at the mouth of River You means that
he has the intention of taking Nanjun. Having spent much military energy and
spared no expenditure, we thought the territory should fall to us easily. Those
others are opposed to us, and they wish to get the advantage of what we have
already accomplished. However, they must remember that I am not dead yet.â
âHow can you prevent them?â asked Lu Su.
âI will go myself and speak with them. If all goes well, then, let it be so.
In case it does not, then I shall immediately settle up with Liu Bei without
waiting for Nanjun to be taken.â
âI should like to accompany you,â said Lu Su.
The commander and his adviser started, taking with them a guard of three
thousand light horse. Having arrived at Youkou, they sought out Sun Qian, who,
in turn, went in to see Liu Bei and told him Zhou Yu had come to render thanks.
âWhy has he come?â asked Liu Bei of his Directing Instructor.
âHe is not likely to come out of simple politeness. Surely he has come in
connection with Nanjun.â
âBut if he brings an army, can we stand against it?â asked Liu Bei.
âWhen he comes, you may reply thus and thus.â
Then they drew up the warships in the river and ranged the soldiers upon the
bank. When the arrival of Zhou Yu was formally announced, Zhao Zilong, with
some horsemen, went to welcome him. When Zhou Yu saw what bold soldiers they
looked, he began to feel uncomfortable, but he went on his way. Being met at
the camp gates by Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang, he was taken in to the chief tent,
where the ceremonies were performed and preparations for a banquet had been
made.
Presently Liu Bei raised his cup in felicitation on the recent victory gained
by his guest. The banquet proceeded.
After a few more courses Zhou Yu said, âOf course you are camped here with no
other idea than to take Nanjun?â
Liu Bei said, âWe heard you were going to take the place and came to assist.
Should you not take it, then we will occupy it.â
Zhou Yu laughed, saying, âWe of the South Land have long wished for this
territory. Now that it is within our grasp, we naturally shall take it.â
Liu Bei said, âThere is always some uncertainty. Cao Cao left Cao Ren to
guard the region, and you may be certain that there is good strategy behind Cao
Ren, to say nothing of his boldness as a warrior. I fear you may not get it.â
âWell, if we do not take it then, Sir, you may have it,â said Zhou Yu.
âHere are witnesses to your words,â said Liu Bei, naming Lu Su, Zhuge
Liang, and those at table. âI hope you will never repent what you have just
said.â
Lu Su stammered and seemed unwilling to be cited as one of the witnesses, but
Zhou Yu said, âWhen the word of a noble person has gone forth, it is ended.
He never regrets.â
âThis speech of yours, Sir, is very generous,â interjected Zhuge Liang.
âThe South Land shall try first. But if the place does not fall, there is no
reason why my lord should not capture it.â
The two visitors then took their leave and rode away.
As soon as they had left, Liu Bei turned to Zhuge Liang and said, âO Master,
you bade me thus reply to Zhou Yu. But though I did so, I have turned it over
and over in my mind without finding any reason in what I said. I am alone and
weak, without a single foot of land to call my own. I desired to get possession
of Nanjun that I might have, at least, a temporary shelter, yet I have said
that Zhou Yu may attack it first. If it falls to the South Land, how can I get
possession?â
Zhuge Liang laughed and replied, âFirst I advised you to attack Jingzhou, but
you would not listen. Do you remember?â
âBut it belonged to Liu Biao, and I could not bear to attack it then. Now it
belongs to Cao Cao, I might do so.â
âDo not be anxious,â replied the adviser. âLet Zhou Yu go and attack it.
Some day, my lord, I shall make you sit in the high place thereof.â
âBut what design have you?â
âSo and so,â said Zhuge Liang, whispering.
Liu Bei was satisfied with the reply, and only strengthened his position at
Youkou.
In the meantime Zhou Yu and Lu Su returned to their own camp, and the latter
said, âWhy did you tell Liu Bei that he might attack Nanjun?â
âI can take it with a flick of my finger,â replied Zhou Yu, âbut I just
manifested a little pretended kindliness.â
Then he inquired among his officers for a volunteer to attack the city. Jiang
Qin offered himself, and was put in command of the vanguard, with Xu Sheng and
Ding Feng as helpers. He was given five thousand of veterans, and they moved
across the river. Zhou Yu promised to follow with supports.
On the other side Cao Ren ordered Cao Hong to guard Yiling, and so hold one
corner of an ox-horn defense.
When the news came that the South Landâs force had crossed the River Han, Cao
Ren said, âWe will defend and not offer battle.â
But General Niu Jin said impetuously, âTo let the enemy approach the walls
and not offer battle is timidity. Our troops, lately worsted, need heartening
and must show their mettle. Let me have five hundred of veterans, and I will
fight to a finish.â
Cao Ren could not withstand this offer, and so the five hundred went out of the
city. At once Ding Feng came to challenge the leader, and they fought a few
bouts. Then Ding Feng pretended to be defeated, gave up the fight, and
retreated into his own lines. Niu Jin followed him hard. When he had got within
the South Landâs formation, at a signal from Ding Feng, the army closed round
and Niu Jin was surrounded. He pushed right and left, but could find no way
out. Seeing Niu Jin in the toils, Cao Ren, who had watched the fight from the
wall, donned his armor and came out of the city at the head of his own bold
company of horsemen and burst in among the forces of the South Land to try to
rescue his colleague. Beating back Xu Sheng, Cao Ren fought his way in and
presently rescued Niu Jin.
However, having got out, Cao Ren saw several score of horsemen still in the
middle unable to make their way out, whereupon he turned again to the battle
and dashed in to their rescue. This time he met Jiang Qin on whom Cao Ren and
Niu Jin made a violent attack. Then his brother Cao Chun came up with supports,
and the great battle ended in a defeat for the troops of the South Land.
So Cao Ren went back victor, while the unhappy Jiang Qin returned to report his
failure. Zhou Yu was very angry and would have put to death his hapless
subordinate but for the intervention of the other officers. Then Zhou Yu
prepared for another attack where he himself would lead.
But Gan Ning said, âGeneral, do not be in too great hurry. Let me go first
and attack Yiling, the supporting angle of the ox-horn formation. After that
the conquest of Nanjun will be easy.â
Zhou Yu accepted the plan and Gan Ning, with three thousand troops, went to
attack Yiling.
When news of the approaching army reached him, Cao Ren called to his side Chen
Jiao, who said, âIf Yiling be lost, then Nanjun is lost too. So help must be
sent quickly.â
Thereupon Cao Chun and Niu Jin were sent by secret ways to the aid of Cao Hong.
Cao Chun sent a messenger to the city to ask that they should cause a diversion
by a sortie at the time the reinforcements should arrive.
So when Gan Ning drew near, Cao Hong went out to meet and engage him. They
fought a score of rounds, but Cao Hong was overcome at last, and Gan Ning took
the city. However, as evening fell the reinforcements under Cao Chun and Niu
Jin came up, and the captor was surrounded in the city he had taken. The scouts
went off immediately to tell Zhou Yu of this sudden change of affairs which
greatly alarmed him.
âLet us hasten to his rescue,â said Cheng Pu.
âOur place is of the greatest importance,â said Zhou Yu, âand I am afraid
to leave it undefended lest Cao Ren should attack.â
âBut Gan Ning is one of our first leaders and must be rescued,â said Lu
Meng.
âI should like to go myself to his aid, but whom can I leave here in my
place?â said Zhou Yu.
âLeave Ling Tong here,â said Lu Meng. âI will push on ahead, and you can
protect my advance. In less than ten days we shall be singing the paean of
victory.â
âAre you willing?â said Zhou Yu to the man who was to act for him.
Ling Tong said, âIf the ten-day period is not exceeded, I may be able to
carry on for that time. I am unequal to more than that.â
Ling Tongâs consent pleased Zhou Yu who started at once, leaving ten thousand
troops for the defense of the camp.
Lu Meng said to his chief, âSouth of Yiling is a little-used road that may
prove very useful in an attack on Nanjun. Let us send a party to fell trees and
barricade this road so that horses cannot pass. In case of defeat, the defeated
will take this road and will be compelled to abandon their horses, which we
shall capture.â
Zhou Yu approved, and the men set out. When the main army drew near Yiling,
Zhou Yu asked who would try to break through the besiegers, and Zhou Tai
offered himself. He girded on his sword, mounted his steed, and burst straight
into the Cao Hongâs army. He got through to the city wall.
From the city wall Gan Ning saw the approach of his friend Zhou Tai and went
out to welcome him. Zhou Tai told him the Commander-in-Chief was on the way to
his relief, and Gan Ning at once bade the defenders prepare from within to
support the attack of the rescuers.
When the news of the approach of Zhou Yu had reached Yiling, Cao Hong, Cao
Chun, and Niu Jin had sent to tell Cao Ren, who was at Nanjun, and at the same
time they prepared to repel the assailants.
As the army of the South Land came near, they at once attacked. Simultaneously
Gan Ning and Zhou Tai went out to attack on two sides, and the troops of Cao
Hong were thrown into confusion. The soldiers of the South Land fell on
lustily, and the three leaders all fled by a bye road, but, finding the way
barred with felled trees and other obstacles, they had to abandon their horses
and go afoot. In this way the troops of the South Land gained some five hundred
steeds.
Zhou Yu, pressing on as quickly as possible toward Nanjun, came upon Cao Ren
and his army marching to save Yiling. The two armies engaged and fought a
battle which lasted till late in the evening. Then both drew off, and Cao Ren
withdrew into the city.
During the night he called his officers to a council.
Then said Cao Hong, âThe loss of Yiling has brought us to a dangerous pass.
Now it seems the time to open the guide-letter of the Prime Minister, and see
what plans he arranged for our salvation in this peril.â
âYou but say what I think,â replied Cao Ren.
Whereupon he tore open the guide-letter and read it. His face lighted up with
joy, and he at once issued orders to have the morning meal prepared at the
fifth watch. At daylight the whole army moved out of the city through three
gates, but they left a semblance of occupation in the shape of banners on the
walls.
Zhou Yu went up to the tower of observation and looked over the city. He saw
that the flags along the battlements had no guards behind them, and he noticed
that all troops carried bundles at their waists behind so that they were ready
for a long march.
Thought Zhou Yu to himself, âCao Ren must be prepared for a long march.â
So Zhou Yu went down from the tower of observation and sent out an order for
two wings of the army to be ready. One of these was to attack and, in case of
its success, the other was to pursue at full speed till the clanging of the
gongs should call them to return. He took command of the leading force in
person, and Cheng Pu commanded the other. Thus they advanced to attack the
city.
The armies being arrayed facing each other, the drums rolled out across the
plain. Cao Hong rode forth and challenged, and Zhou Yu, from his place by the
standard, bade Han Dang respond. The two champions fought near two score bouts,
and then Cao Hong fled. Thereupon Cao Ren came out to help him, and Zhou Tai
rode out at full speed to meet him. These two exchanged a half score passes and
then Cao Ren tied.
Cao Renâs army fell into confusion. Thereupon Zhou Yu gave the signal for the
advance of both his wings, and the forces of Cao Ren were sore smitten and
defeated. Zhou Yu pursued to the city wall, but Cao Renâs troops did not
enter the city. Instead, they went away northwest. Han Dang and Zhou Tai
pressed them hard.
Zhou Yu, seeing the city gates standing wide open and no guards upon the walls,
ordered the raiding of the city. A few score horsemen rode in first, Zhou Yu
followed and whipping his steed. As he galloped into the enclosure around the
gate, Chen Jiao stood on the defense tower. When he saw Zhou Yu enter, in his
heart he applauded the god-like perspicacity of the Prime Minister Cao Cao.
Then was heard the clap-clap of a watchmanâs rattle. At this signal the
archers and crossbowmen let fly, and the arrows and bolts flew forth in a
sudden fierce shower, while those who had won their way to the van of the
inrush went headlong into a deep trench. Zhou Yu managed to pull up in time,
but turning to escape, he was wounded in the left side and fell to the ground.
Niu Jin rushed out from the city to capture the chief, but Xu Sheng and Ding
Feng at the risk of their lives got him away safe. Then the troops of Cao Ren
dashed out of the city and wrought confusion among the troops of the South
Land, who trampled each other down and many more fell into the trenches. Cheng
Pu tried to draw off, but Cao Ren and Cao Hong came toward him from different
directions, and the battle went hardly against the soldiers of Zhou Yu, till
help came from Ling Tong, who bore back their assailants. Satisfied with their
success, Cao Ren led his forces into the city, while the losers marched back to
their own camp.
Zhou Yu, sorely wounded, was taken to his own tent and the army physician
called in. With iron forceps, he extracted the sharp bolt and dressed the wound
with a lotion designed to counteract the poison of the metal. But the pain was
intense, and the patient rejected all nourishment.
The physician said, âThe missile had been poisoned, and the wound will
require a long time to heal. You, General, must be kept quiet and especially
free from any irritation, which will cause the wound to reopen.â
Thereupon Cheng Pu gave orders that each division was to remain in camp. Three
days later, Niu Jin came within sight and challenged the men of the South Land
to battle, but they did not stir. The enemy hurled at them taunts and insults
till the sun had fallen low in the sky, but it was of no avail and Niu Jin
withdrew.
Next day Niu Jin returned and repeated his insulting abuse. Cheng Pu dared not
tell the wounded general. The third day, waxing bolder, the enemy came to the
very gates of the stockade, the leader shouting that he had come for the
purpose of capturing Zhou Yu.
Then Cheng Pu called together his officers, and they discussed the feasibility
of retirement into the South Land that they might seek the opinion of Sun Quan.
Ill as he was, Zhou Yu still retained control of the expedition. He knew that
the enemy came daily to the gates of his camp and reviled him, although none of
his officers told him. One day Cao Ren came in person, and there was much
rolling of drums and shouting. Cheng Pu, however, steadily refused to accept
the challenge and would not let anyone go out.
Then Zhou Yu summoned the officers to his bedside and said, âWhat mean the
drums and the shouting?â
âThe soldiers are drilling,â was the reply.
âWhy do you deceive me?â said Zhou Yu angrily. âDo I not know that our
enemies come day by day to our gates and insult us? Yet Cheng Pu suffers this
in silence and makes no use of his powers and authority.â
He sent for Cheng Pu and, when he arrived, asked him why he acted thus.
âBecause you are ill, and the physician said you were on no account to be
provoked to anger. Wherefore, although the enemy challenged us to battle, I
kept it from you.â
âAnd if you do not fight, what think you should be done?â said Zhou Yu.
And they all said they desired to return to the South Land till he had
recovered from his wound, when they would make another expedition.
Zhou Yu lay and listened. Suddenly he sprang up, crying, âThe noble person
who has eaten of his lordâs bounty should die in his lordâs battles. To
return home dead and wrapped in a horseâs hide is a happy fate. Am I the sort
of people to bring to nought the grand designs of my lord?â
So speaking he proceeded to gird on his armor, and he mounted his horse. The
wonder of the officers only redoubled when their General placed himself at the
head of some hundreds of horsemen and went out of the camp gates toward the
enemy, then fully arrayed. Cao Ren, their general, stood beneath the great
standard.
At sight of the opponents, Cao Ren flourished his whip and began to hurl abuse
at them, âZhou Yu, you babe! I think your fate has met you. You dare not face
my army!â
The stream of insult never ceased.
Presently Zhou Yu could stand it no longer. Riding out to the front he cried,
âHere I am, base churl. Look at me!â
The whole Cao Renâs army were taken aback. But Cao Ren turned to those about
him and said, âLet us all revile him!â
And the whole army yelled insults.
Zhou Yu grew angry and sent Pan Zhang out to fight. But before he had delivered
his first blow, Zhou Yu suddenly uttered a loud cry, and he fell to the ground
with blood gushing from his mouth.
At this Cao Renâs army rushed to the battle, and the army of the South Land
pressed forward to meet them. A fierce struggle waged around Zhou Yuâs body,
but he was borne off safely and taken to his tent.
âDo you feel better?â asked Cheng Pu anxiously.
âIt was a ruse of mine,â whispered Zhou Yu in reply.
âBut what avails it?â
âI am not suffering, but I did that to make our enemies think I was very ill
and so oppose them by deceit. I will send a few trusty men to pretend desertion
and tell them I am dead. That will cause them to try a night raid on the camp,
and we shall have an ambush ready for them. We shall get Cao Ren easily.â
âThe plan seems excellent,â said Cheng Pu.
Soon from the tent there arose the sound of wailing as for the dead. The
soldiers around took up the cry and said one to another, âThe General is dead
of his wound!â and they all put on the symbols of mourning.
Meanwhile Cao Ren was consulting with his officers.
Said he, âZhou Yu lost his temper, and that has caused his wound to reopen
and brought on that flow of blood. You saw him fall to the ground, and he will
assuredly die soon.â
Just then there came in one who said that a few men had come over from the
enemy asking to be allowed to join the army of Cao Ren. Among them were two of
Cao Caoâs men who had been made prisoners. Cao Ren sent for the deserters and
questioned them.
They told him, saying, âZhou Yuâs wound reopened at his anger, and he died
in the camp that day. The leaders are all clothing in white and in mourning. We
desert because we have been put to shame by the second in command.â
Pleased at this news, Cao Ren at once began to arrange to make a night attack
on the camp and, if possible, get the head of the dead general to send to the
capital.
âSuccess depends upon promptitude, so act without delay,â said Chen Jiao.
Niu Jin was told off as Van Leader, Cao Ren himself led the center, while the
rear was commanded by Cao Hong and Cao Chun. Chen Jiao and a small force were
left to guard Nanjun.
At the first watch they left the city and took the way toward Zhou Yuâs camp.
When they drew near, not a soldier was visible in the camp, but flags and
banners and spears were all there, evidently to keep up an appearance of
preparation. Feeling at once that they had been tricked, they turned to
retreat.
But a bomb exploded, and this was the signal for an attack on all four sides.
Han Dang and Jiang Qin pressed in from the east; Zhou Tai and Pan Zhang, from
the west; Chen Wu and Lu Meng, from the north; and Xu Sheng and Ding Feng, from
the south. The result was a severe defeat for the raiders, and the army of Cao
Ren was entirely broken and scattered abroad so that no one part of the beaten
army could aid the other.
Cao Ren, with a few horsemen got out of the press and presently met Cao Hong.
The two leaders ran away together, and by the fifth watch they had got near
Nanjun. Then they heard a beating of drums, and Ling Tong appeared barring the
way. There was a small skirmish, and Cao Ren went off at an angle. But he fell
in with Gan Ning, who attacked him vigorously. Cao Ren dared not go back to
Nanjun, but he made for Xiangyang along the main road. The forces of the South
Land pursued him for a time and then desisted.
Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu then made their way to Nanjun where they were startled to
see flags on the walls and every sign of occupation.
Before they had recovered from their surprise, there appeared one who cried,
âPardon, General! I had orders from the Directing Instructor to take this
city. I am Zhao Zilong of Changshan.â
Zhou Yu was fiercely angry and gave orders to assault the city, but the
defenders sent down flights and flights of arrows, and his troops could not
stay near the rampart. So he withdrew and took counsel. In the meantime he
decided to send Gan Ning with a force of several thousand to capture Jingzhou
City, and Ling Tong with another army to take Xiangyang. Nanjun could be taken
later.
But even as these orders were being given, the scouts came in hurriedly to
report, saying, âAfter Nanjun fell, Zhuge Liang, suddenly forging a military
commission, induced the guards of Jingzhou City to leave it and go to the
rescue of Cao Ren. Whereupon Zhang Fei occupied the capital.â
Soon after another messenger came, saying, âXiahou Dun, at Xiangyang,
received from Zhuge Liang dispatches, supported by a commission in due form,
saying that Cao Ren was in danger and needed help, whereupon Xiahou Dun marched
off, and Guan Yu seized that city.â
Thus the two cities that Zhou Yu wanted had fallen, without the least effort,
into the hands of his rival Liu Bei.
âHow did Zhuge Liang get this military commission with which he has imposed
on the generals?â asked Zhou Yu.
Cheng Pu replied, âHe seized that of Chen Jiao and so has got all this region
into his power.â
Zhou Yu uttered a great cry, for at that moment his wound had suddenly burst
open.
A city falls, but not to us the gain;
The guerdon is anotherâs; ours the pain.
The next chapter will say what befell Zhou Yu.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 52 ****
and at hearing the same news of Jingzhou and Xiangyang, was but natural. And
this sudden fit of rage caused his wound to reopen. However, he soon recovered.
All his officers besought him to accept the situation.
But he said, âWhat but the death of that bumpkin Zhuge Liang will assuage my
anger? If Cheng Pu can but aid me in an attack on Nanjun, I can certainly
restore it to the South Land.â
Soon Lu Su came in, to whom Zhou Yu said, âI simply must fight Liu Bei and
Zhuge Liang till it is decided which shall have the upper hand. I must also
recapture the cities. Perhaps you can assist me.â
âIt cannot be done,â replied Lu Su. âWe are now at grips with Cao Cao,
and victory or defeat is undecided. Our lord has not been successful in
overcoming Hefei. Do not fight near home, or it will be like people of the same
household destroying each other. Should Cao Cao take advantage of this position
to make a sudden descent, we should be in a parlous condition. Further, you
must remember that Liu Bei and Cao Cao are united by the bonds of old
friendship. If the pressure becomes too great, Liu Bei may relinquish these
cities, offer them to Cao Cao, and join forces with him to attack the south.
That would be a real misfortune.â
âI cannot help being angry,â said Zhou Yu, âto think that we should have
used our resources for their benefit. They get all the advantage.â
âWell, let me go and see Liu Bei and talk reason to him. If I can arrive at
no understanding, then attack at once.â
âExcellent proposal!â cried all present.
So Lu Su, with his escort, went away to Nanjun to carry out his proposal and
try to arrange matters. He reached the city wall and summoned the gate, whereat
Zhao Zilong came out to speak with him.
âI have something to say to Liu Bei,â said he. âI wish to see him.â
âMy lord and Zhuge Liang are in Jingzhou,â was the reply.
Lu Su turned away and hasted to Jingzhou. He found the walls bedecked with
flags and everything in excellent order. In his heart he admired the sight, and
thought what an able person was the commander of that army.
The guards reported his arrival, and Zhuge Liang ordered them to throw wide the
gate. Lu Su was led to the government house and, after the usual exchange of
salutes, Zhuge Liang and his visitor took their respective seats.
Having finished the tea, Lu Su said, âMy master, Marquis Sun Quan, and the
commander of his army, Zhou Yu, have sent me to lay before the Imperial Uncle
their views. When Cao Cao led his huge host southward, he gave out that it was
for the conquest of the South Land. But really his intention was to destroy Liu
Bei. Happily our army was able to repulse that mighty host and so saved him.
Wherefore Jingzhou with its nine territories of forty-two counties ought to
belong to us. But by a treacherous move, your master has occupied Jingzhou and
Xiangyang, so that we have spent our treasure in vain and our armies have
fought to no purpose. The Imperial Uncle has reaped the benefits to the full.
This is not as it should be.â
Zhuge Liang replied, âLu Su, you are a man of high intelligence. Why do you
hold such language? You know the saying that all things return to their owner.
These places have never belonged to the South Land, but were of the patrimony
of Liu Biao, and though he is dead, his son remains. Should not the uncle
assist the nephew to recover his own? Could my master have refrained?â
âIf the nephew Liu Qi, the rightful heir, had occupied these cities, there
would have been something to say. But he is at Jiangxia and not here.â
âWould you like to see him?â said Zhuge Liang.
At the same time he ordered the servants to request Liu Qi to come. Thereupon
Liu Qi at once appeared, supported by two attendants.
Addressing Lu Su, Liu Qi said, âI am too weak to perform the correct
ceremonies. I pray you pardon me, Lu Su.â
Lu Su said not a word. He was too much taken aback. However, he recovered
himself presently and said, âBut if the heir had not been here, what then?â
âThe heir is living but from day to day. Should he go, then â-there will be
something to talk about.â
âShould he die, then you ought to return these cities to us.â
âYou state the exact facts,â said Zhuge Liang.
Then a banquet was prepared and, that over, Lu Su took his leave. He hastened
back to his own camp and gave Zhou Yu an account of his mission.
âBut what is there for us in the chance of Liu Qiâs death?â said Zhou Yu.
âHe is in his very first youth. When will these places fall to us?â
âRest content, General. Let me guarantee the return of these places.â
âBut how can you?â asked Zhou Yu.
âLiu Qi has indulged too freely in wine and women. He is a wreck and rotten
to the core, miserably emaciated and panting for breath. I will not give him
half a yearâs life. Then I will go to Liu Bei, and he will be unable to deny
the request.â
But Zhou Yu was still unmollified.
Suddenly came a messenger from Sun Quan, who said, âOur lord is laying siege
to Hefei but in several battles has had no victory. He now orders you to
withdraw from here and go to Hefei to help him.â
Thereupon Zhou Yu marched back to Chaisang. Having reached home, he began to
give attention to the recovery of his health. He sent Cheng Pu with the marine
and land forces to Hefei ready for Sun Quanâs call.
Liu Bei was exceedingly well satisfied with the possession of his new region,
and his thoughts turned to more ambitious schemes. Then a certain man came to
him to suggest a plan. This man was Yi Ji and, remembering the kindly feeling
of other days, Liu Bei received him most graciously.
When Yi Ji was seated, and his host had asked what he proposed, he said, âYou
wish for a plan to accomplish yet greater deeds. Why not seek wise people and
ask them?â
âWhere are these wise people to be found?â asked Liu Bei.
Yi Ji replied, âIn this region there is a certain family named Ma, five
brothers, all of whom are known as men of ability. The youngest is called Ma
Su. The ablest is Ma Liang, who has white hairs in his eyebrows, and the
villagers have a little rhyming couplet that means âThere are five sons in
the family Ma, but white eyebrows is the best of them.â You should get this
man to draw up a plan for you.â
So Liu Bei told them to request his presence. Ma Liang came and was received
with great respect.
He was asked to suggest a plan for the security of the newly acquired region,
and he said, âAttacked as it is on all sides, this region is not one in which
one is permanently secure. You should let Liu Qi remain here till he is
recovered from his present illness, but the actual protection of the place is
to be placed in the hands of trusty friends. Obtain an edict appointing him
Imperial Protector of Jingzhou, and the people will be content. Then conquer
Wuling, Changsha, Guiyang, and Lingling. And with the resources you will thus
acquire, you will have the means for further plans. That should be your
policy.â
âWhich of the four territories should be first taken?â asked Liu Bei.
âThe nearest, Lingling, which lies in the west of River Xiang. The next is
Wuling, and after these the other two.â
Ma Liang was given an appointment as Imperial Protector Assistant, with Yi Ji
as his second. Then Liu Bei consulted Zhuge Liang about sending Liu Qi to
Xiangyang, so that Guan Yu could be free to return. Next they made preparations
to attack Lingling, and Zhang Fei was to lead the van. Zhao Zilong was to guard
the rear, while Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang were to command the main body. A
fifteen thousand troops were left to hold Jingzhou. Mi Zhu and Liu Feng were
left to guard Jiangling.
The Governor of Lingling was Liu Du. When danger thus threatened, he called in
his son Liu Xiang, and they discussed the case.
The son was very self-confident and said to his father, âHave no anxiety.
They may have the known and famous warriors, Zhang Fei and Zhao Zilong, but we
have our leader, Xing Darong, who is match for any number of men. He can
withstand them.â
So Liu Xiang, with the famous leader, was entrusted with the defense. At the
head of a full ten thousand troops, they made a camp about ten miles from the
city, with the shelter of hills and a river. Their scouts brought news that
Zhuge Liang was close at hand with one army. Xing Darong decided to check his
advance and went forth to oppose him. When both sides were arrayed, Xing Darong
rode to the front. In his hand he held a battle-ax called Cleaver of Mountains.
In a mighty voice he cried, âRebels, how comes it that you have dared to
enter our territory?â
From the center of the opposing army, where appeared a cluster of yellow flags,
there came out a small four-wheeled carriage in which sat, very erect, a
certain man dressed in white, with a turban on his head. In one hand he held a
feather fan, with which he signed to the warrior to approach.
At the same time he said, âI am Zhuge Liang of Nanyang, whose plans broke up
the countless legions of Cao Cao so that nothing of them returned whence they
started. How then can you hope to oppose me? I now offer you peace, and it will
be well for you to surrender.â
Xing Darong laughed derisively, saying, âTheir defeat was owing to the plan
of Zhou Yu. You had nothing to do with it. How dare you try to deceive me?â
So saying he swung up his battle-ax and came running toward Zhuge Liang. But
Zhuge Liang turned his carriage and retired within the lines which closed up
behind him. Xing Darong came rushing on. As he reached the array, the troops
fell away on both sides and let him enter. Well within he looked round for his
chief opponent. Seeing a yellow flag moving along quietly, he concluded that
Zhuge Liang was with it and so followed it. When the flag had gone over the
shoulder of a hill it stopped. Then suddenly as if the earth had opened and
swallowed it up, the four-wheeled carriage disappeared, while in its place came
a ferocious warrior, with a long serpent halberd in his hand and mounted on a
curvetting steed. It was Zhang Fei, who dashed at Xing Darong with a tremendous
roar.
Nothing daunted, Xing Darong whirled up his battle-ax and went to meet Zhang
Fei. But after four or five bouts, Xing Darong saw that there was no chance of
victory for him, so he turned his horse and ran. Zhang Fei pursued, the air
shaking with the thunder of his voice. Then the ambushing troops appeared. Xing
Darong, nothing daunted, rushed into their midst.
But in front appeared another warrior barring the way, who called out, âDo
you know me? I am Zhao Zilong of Changshan.â
Xing Darong knew that all was over. He could neither fight nor fly. So he
dismounted and gave in. He was fettered and taken to camp, where were Liu Bei
and Zhuge Liang. Liu Bei ordered him out to execution, but Zhuge Liang hastily
checked him.
âWe will accept your submission if you capture Liu Xiang for us,â said
Zhuge Liang.
The captive accepted the offer without the least hesitation.
When Zhuge Liang asked how he intended to do it, he replied, âIf you will set
me free, I shall be cunning of speech. If you raid the camp this evening, you
will find me your helper on the inside. I will make Liu Xiang a prisoner and
will hand him over to you. He being captured, his father will surrender at
once.â
Liu Bei doubted the good faith of the man, but Zhuge Liang said, âXing Darong
is not deceiving.â
Wherefore Xing Darong was set free and went back to camp, where he related all
that had occurred.
âWhat can we do?â asked Liu Xiang.
âWe can meet trick with trick. Put soldiers in ambush tonight outside our
camp while within everything will appear as usual. When Zhuge Liang comes we
shall capture him.â
The ambush was prepared. At the second watch an army came out of the darkness
and appeared in the gate. Each carried a torch and they began to set fire to
all about them. Out dashed Liu Xiang and Xing Darong, and the incendiaries
forthwith fled. The two warriors pursued them, but the fugitives ran and then
suddenly disappeared at about three miles from the camp.
Much surprised the two turned to wend their way back to their own camp. It was
still burning for no one had extinguished the flames. Soon from behind them
came out Zhang Fei.
Liu Xiang called out to his companion, saying, âDo not enter the burning
camp, but to go to attack Zhuge Liangâs stockade.â
Thereupon they turned again, but at a distance of three miles Zhao Zilong and
an army suddenly debouched upon their road. Zhao Zilong attacked and slew Xing
Darong by a spear thrust. Liu Xiang turned to flee, but Zhang Fei was close
upon him and made him prisoner. He was thrown across a horse, bound, and taken
to camp.
When he saw Zhuge Liang, Liu Xiang said, âThe ruse was Xing Darongâs evil
counsel. I was forced to follow.â
Zhuge Liang ordered them to loose his bonds, had him properly dressed, and gave
him wine to cheer him and help him forget his troubles. When he was recovered,
he was told to go to his father and persuade him to yield.
âAnd if he does not, the city shall be destroyed and everyone put to
death,â said Zhuge Liang as Liu Xiang left.
The son returned to the city and told his father these things. Liu Du at once
decided to yield and forthwith hoisted the flag of surrender, opened the gates,
and went out taking his seal of office with him. He was reappointed to his
governorship, but his son was sent to Jingzhou for service with the army.
The people of Lingling all rejoiced greatly at the change of rulers. Liu Bei
entered the city, calmed and reassured the people, and rewarded his army.
But he at once began to think of the next move and asked for an officer to
volunteer to take Guiyang. Zhao Zilong offered, but Zhang Fei vehemently
proposed himself for the command of the expedition. So they wrangled and
contended.
Then said Zhuge Liang, âUndoubtedly Zhao Zilong was first to volunteer,
wherefore he is to go.â
Still Zhang Fei opposed and insisted on going. They were told to decide the
dispute by drawing lots, and Zhao Zilong drew the winning lot.
Zhang Fei was still very angry and grumbled, âI would not have wanted any
helpers: Just three thousand soldiers and I would have done it.â
âI also only want three thousand soldiers,â said Zhao Zilong. âAnd if I
fail, I am willing to suffer the penalties.â
Zhuge Liang was pleased that Zhao Zilong recognized his responsibility so
fully, and with the commission he gave Zhao Zilong three thousand of veterans.
Though the matter was thus settled, Zhang Fei was discontented and pressed his
claim till Liu Bei bade him desist and retire.
With his three thousand troops, Zhao Zilong took the road to Guiyang. The
Governor, Zhao Fan, soon heard of his approach and hastily called his officers
to take counsel. Two of them, Chen Ying and Bao Long, offered to meet the
invaders and turn them back.
These two warriors belonged to Guiyang and had made themselves famous as
hunters. Chen Ying used a âFlying Fork,â and Bao Long could draw a bow with
such force that he had been known to send an arrow through two tigers. So
strong were they, as well as bold.
They stood before Zhao Fan and said, âWe will lead the way against Liu
Bei.â
The Governor replied, âI know that Liu Bei is of the imperial family, and
Zhuge Liang is exceedingly resourceful. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei are very bold.
But the commander of this force is Zhao Zilong who, on one occasion, faced a
hundred legions of Cao Cao and never blenched. Our small force here cannot
stand against such people. We shall have to yield.â
âLet me go out to fight,â said Chen Ying. âIf I cannot capture Zhao
Zilong, then you can yield.â
The Governor could not resist him and gave his consent. Then Chen Ying, with
three thousand troops, went forth. Soon the two armies came within sight of
each other. When Chen Yingâs army was drawn up, he girded on his flying fork
and rode to the front. Zhao Zilong gripped his spear and rode to meet him.
Zhao Zilong began to rail at Chen Ying, saying, âMy master is the brother of
Liu Biao to whom belonged this land. Now he is supporting his nephew, the heir
and son of Liu Biao. Having taken Jingzhou, I am come to soothe and comfort the
people here. Why then do you oppose me?â
âWe are supporters of the Prime Minister Cao Cao and are no followers of your
master,â was the reply.
Zhao Zilong, waxing angry, firmly grasped his spear and rode forward. His
opponent twirled the flying fork and advanced. The horses met, but after four
or five encounters Chen Ying, realizing that there was no hope of victory,
turned and fled. Zhao Zilong followed. Suddenly turning, Chen Ying got close to
Zhao Zilong and flung the fork. Zhao Zilong deftly caught it and threw it back.
Chen Ying dodged away, but Zhao Zilong soon caught him up, seized, dragged him
out of the saddle, and threw him to the ground. Then Zhao Zilong called up his
soldiers, and they bound the prisoner. Chen Ying was taken to the camp, while
his troops scattered and fled.
âI thought you would not dare a combat with me,â said Zhao Zilong to the
prisoner when they had returned to camp. âHowever, I am not going to put you
to death. You are free. But persuade your master to yield.â
Chen Ying asked pardon, put his hands over his head, and fled like a frightened
rat. When he reached his city, he told the Governor all these things.
âMy original desire was to yield, but you insisted on fighting, and this is
what it has brought you to.â
So spoke the Governor. He bade Chen Ying begone and then prepared his letter of
submission and put up his seal. With a small party, Zhao Fan went out of the
city and wended his way to Zhao Zilongâs camp. Zhao Zilong received him
graciously, offered him wine, and then accepted the seal of office.
After the wine had gone round several times, Zhao Fan became talkative, saying,
âGeneral, your surname is the same as mine, and five centuries ago we were
one family. You are from Changshan, and so am I. Moreover we are from the same
village. If you do not mind, we might swear brotherhood. I should be very
happy.â
Zhao Zilong was pleased and they compared ages. They were of the same year.
However, Zhao Zilong was the elder by four months, and so Zhao Fan made his bow
as younger brother. The two men, having so many things in common, were very
pleased with each other and seemed fitted to be close friends.
At eventide the feast broke up, and the late Governor returned to his dwelling.
Next day Zhao Fan requested Zhao Zilong to enter the city, where, after Zhao
Zilong had assured the people of their safety, he went to a banquet at the
state residence. When they had become mellow with wine, the Governor invited
Zhao Zilong into the inner quarters, where wine was again served. When Zhao
Zilong was a little intoxicated, his host bade a woman come forth and offer a
cup of wine to the guest.
The woman was dressed entirely in white silk, and her beauty was such as to
overthrow cities and ruin states.
âWho is she?â asked Zhao Zilong.
âMy sister-in-law. She is of the Fan family.â
Zhao Zilong at once changed his look and treated her with deference. When she
had offered the cup, the host told her to be seated and join the party, but
Zhao Zilong declined this addition to the evening, and the lady withdrew.
âWhy did you trouble your sister-in-law to present wine to me, brother?â
asked Zhao Zilong.
âThere is a reason,â said the host smiling. âI pray you let me tell you.
My brother died three years ago and left her a widow. But this cannot be
regarded as the end of the story. I have often advised her to marry again, but
she said she would only do so if three conditions were satisfied in one manâs
person. The suitor must be famous for literary grace and warlike exploits,
secondly, handsome and highly esteemed and, thirdly, of the same name as our
own. Now where in all the world was such a combination likely to be found? Yet
here are you, brother, dignified, handsome, and prepossessing, a man whose name
is known all over the wide world and of the desired name. You exactly fulfill
my sisterâs ambitions. If you do not find her too plain, I should like her to
marry you and I will provide a dowry. What think you of such an alliance, such
a bond of relationship?â
But Zhao Zilong rose in anger, shouting, âAs I have just sworn brotherhood
with you, is not your sister-in-law my sister-in-law? How could you think of
bringing such confusion into the relationship?â
Shame suffused Zhao Fanâs face, and he said, âI only thought of being kind
to you. Why are you so very rude to me?â
Zhao Fan looked right and left to his attendants with murder in his eye. Zhao
Zilong raised his fist and knocked him down.
Then he strode out of the place, mounted, and rode out of the city.
Zhao Fan at once called in his two generals.
Chen Ying said, âHe has gone away in a rage, which means that we shall have
to fight him.â
âI greatly fear you will lose,â said Zhao Fan.
âWe will pretend to be deserters,â said Bao Long, âand so get among his
soldiers. When you challenge him, we will suddenly catch him.â
âWe shall have to take some others with us,â said Chen Ying.
âFive hundred troops will be ample,â said Bao Long.
So in the night the two men and their followers ran over to Zhao Zilongâs
camp to desert.
Zhao Zilong understood the trick they would play, but he called them in, and
they said, âWhen Zhao Fan tempted you with that fair lady, he wanted to make
you drunk and get you into the private apartments so that he might murder you
and send your head to Cao Cao. Yes, he was as wicked as that even. We saw you
go away in anger, and we thought that would mean grave trouble for us, and so
we have deserted.â
Zhao Zilong listened with simulated joy, and he had wine served to the two men,
and pressed them to drink so that they were quite overcome. When this was done,
he had both bound with cords, called up their followers, and asked them whether
this was real or pretended desertion, and they told him the truth.
Then he gave the soldiers wine and said, âThose who wanted to harm me are
your leaders and not you. If you do as I tell you, you shall be well
rewarded.â
The soldiers threw themselves to the ground and promised obedience. Thereupon
the two leaders â-Chen Ying and Bao Long â-were beheaded. Their five
hundred troops were made to lead the way and act as screen for a whole thousand
of horsemen, and the party set out at full speed for Guiyang. When they got
there, they summoned the gate and said that they had slain Zhao Zilong and had
got back. And they wished to speak with the Governor.
Those on the wall lighted flares and inspected those at the gate. Surely enough
they wore the uniforms of their own people, and Zhao Fan went out to them. He
was immediately seized and made prisoner. Then Zhao Zilong entered the city,
restored order, and sent off swift messengers to Liu Bei who at once, with his
adviser, came to Guiyang.
When they had taken their seats, the late Governor was brought in and placed at
the foot of the steps. In response to Zhuge Liangâs questions, Zhao Fan
related the story of the proposed marriage.
Said Zhuge Liang to Zhao Zilong, âBut this seems a fine project. Why did you
receive the proposal so roughly?â
Zhao Zilong said, âZhao Fan and I had just sworn brotherhood, and so marriage
with his sister-in-law would have called down on my head universal blame. That
is one reason. Another is that I should have made his sister fail to keep her
dutiful chastity. And thirdly, I did not know whether I might trust such a
proposal from one who had just yielded to force. My lord, your position as a
recent victor was one of danger, and could I risk the failure of your plans for
my sake?â
Liu Bei said, âBut now that the plan has been carried out, and we are
victors, would you care to marry her?â
âAll my fear is for the building of a reputation. Family can come later.â
âYou are indeed right honorable,â said Liu Bei.
Zhao Fan was released and restored to the governorship. Zhao Zilong was
conspicuously rewarded.
But Zhang Fei was angry and disappointed.
âSo Zhao Zilong gets all the praise, and I am worth nothing,â cried he.
âJust give me three thousand soldiers, and I will take Wuling and bring you
the Governor.â
This pleased Zhuge Liang, who said, âThere is no reason why you should not
go, but I will only require one condition of you.â
Wondrous, the plans of the general, so doth he conquer in battle;
Soldiers keenly competing gain renown in the fighting.
The condition that Zhuge Liang made will appear in the next chapter.

**** Chapter 53 ****
responsibility for success.
Said Zhuge Liang, âWhen Zhao Zilong went on his expedition, he gave written
guarantee of being responsible for success. You ought to do the same now that
you are starting for Wuling. In that case you may have men and start.â
So Zhang Fei gave the required document and received joyfully the three
thousand of soldiers he had demanded. He set out at once and traveled without
rest till he reached Wuling.
When the Governor of Wuling, Jin Xuan by name, heard that an expedition against
him was afoot, he mustered his officers and recruited brave soldiers and put
his weapons in order ready for the struggle. And his army moved out of the
city.
A certain secretary, Gong Zhi, remonstrated with his chief for opposing a scion
of the imperial house, saying, âLiu Bei is of the Hans, and recognized as an
uncle of the Emperor. All the world knows he is kindly and righteous. Added to
that his brother Zhang Fei is extraordinarily bold. We cannot face them in
battle with hope of success. Our best course is to give in.â
But his master angrily replied, âDo you want to play the traitor and take the
side of the rebels and help them?â
Jin Xuan called in the lictors and told them to put Gong Zhi to death.
The other officers interceded for Gong Zhi, saying, âIt augers ill to start
an expedition by slaying your own officer.â
So the Governor merely sent Gong Zhi sway. He himself led the army out of the
city. After marching seven miles, he met with Zhang Feiâs army.
Zhang Fei at once rode to the front, spear ready to thrust, and opened with a
shout. Jin Xuan turned to his officers and asked who would go out to fight him,
but no one replied. They were too afraid.
So the Governor himself galloped out, flourishing his sword. Seeing him
advance, Zhang Fei shouted in a voice of thunder. Poor Jin Xuan was seized with
panic, turned pale and could not go on. He turned his steed and fled. Then
Zhang Fei and his army went in pursuit and smote the fugitives, chasing them to
the city wall.
Here the fugitives were greeted by a flight of arrows from their own wall.
Greatly frightened, Jin Xuan looked up to see what this meant, and there was
Gong Zhi, who had opposed him, standing on the wall.
âYou brought defeat upon yourself because you opposed the will of God,â
cried the traitor. âThe people and I are determined to yield to Liu Bei.â
Just as Gong Zhi finished speaking, an arrow wounded Jin Xuan in the face and
he fell to the ground. Thereupon his own troops cut off his head, which they
forthwith presented to Zhang Fei. Gong Zhi then went out and made formal
submission, and Zhang Fei bade him take his letter and the seal to Guiyang to
Liu Bei, who was pleased to hear of Zhang Feiâs success and gave the
governorship to Gong Zhi. Soon after Liu Bei came to Wuling in person and
soothed the people.
This done he wrote to Guan Yu telling him Zhao Zilong and Zhang Fei had gained
a territory each.
Guan Yu at once wrote back and said, âChangsha is yet to be taken. If I am
not thought too feeble, I would like to be sent to attack it.â
Liu Bei agreed and sent Zhang Fei to relieved his brother, whom Liu Bei ordered
to return and prepare for an expedition to Changsha. Guan Yu came and went in
to see his elder brother and Zhuge Liang.
At this interview Zhuge Liang said, âZhao Zilong has taken Guiyang, and Zhang
Fei Wuling. Both successful warriors have done their work with three thousand
troops. The Governor of Changsha, Han Xuan, was not worth mentioning, but there
was a certain general with him, named Huang Zhong, who had to be reckoned with.
âHuang Zhong is a native of Nanyang. He used to be in the service of Liu Biao
and was a colleague Liu Biaoâs nephew, Liu Pan, when he was in command of
Changsha. After Liu Biaoâs death, he joined Han Xuan when he took command of
the city. Now, although he is nearly sixty, he is a man to be feared and a
warrior of a thousand. You ought to take a larger number of troops.â
Guan Yu replied, âInstructor, what makes you damp another manâs ardor to
fight and do away with your own dignity? I do not think the old leader need be
discussed, and I do not think I require three companies of soldiers. Give me my
own five hundred of swordsmen, and I will have the heads of both Han Xuan and
Huang Zhong to sacrifice to our standard.â
Liu Bei resisted this decision of Guan Yu, but Guan Yu would not give way. He
just took his five hundred and set out.
âIf he is not careful how he attacks Huang Zhong, there will be a mishap,â
said Zhuge Liang. âYou must go to support him.â
Liu Bei accordingly, at the head of another and larger party, set out toward
Changsha.
Governor Han Xuan of Changsha was of hasty temperament with small compunction
in matters of life and death and was universally hated. When he heard of the
army coming against him, he called his veteran leader, Huang Zhong, to ask
advice.
The latter said, âDo not be distressed. This sword of mine and my bow are
equal to the slaughter of all who may come.â
Huang Zhong had been very strong and could bend the three-hundred-pound bow and
was a most perfect archer.
When Huang Zhong referred to his prowess, a certain man spoke up and said,
âLet not the Veteran General go out to battle. Trust to my right arm, and you
shall have this Guan Yu a prisoner in your hands.â
The speaker was General Yang Lin. The Governor accepted his offer and told off
a thousand troops to go with him, and they quickly rode out of the city. About
fifteen miles from the city, they observed a great cloud of dust approaching
and soon distinguished the invaders. Yang Lin set his spear and rode to the
front to abuse and fight. Guan Yu made no reply to the abuse, but rode forward
flourishing his sword. The warriors soon met, and in the third encounter Yang
Lin was cut down. Guan Yuâs army dashed forward and pursued the defeated
force to the city wall.
When the Governor heard of this reverse, he ordered the veteran Huang Zhong to
go out while he went up on the city wall to watch the fight.
Huang Zhong took his sword and crossed the drawbridge of Changsha at the head
of his force. Guan Yu, seeing an old leader riding out, knew it must be Huang
Zhong. Guan Yu halted his troops and placed them in line with their swords at
the point.
Then sitting there on horseback, he said, âHe who comes is surely Huang
Zhong, eh?â
âSince you know me, how dare you come within my boundaries?â replied the
veteran.
âI have come expressly to get your head!â
Then the combat began. They fought a hundred and more bouts, and neither seemed
nearer victory. At this point the Governor, fearing some mishap to his veteran
general, beat the gong to retreat and the battle ceased, one side going into
the city of Changsha and the other camping three miles away to the rear.
Guan Yu thought in his heart that the fame of the veteran opposed to him was
well merited. He had fought a hundred bouts and discovered never a weak spot.
He determined that in the next encounter he would use a âswinging-horse
stabâ and so overcome Huang Zhong.
Next day, the early meal eaten, Guan Yu came to the city wall and offered his
challenge. The Governor seated himself on the city wall and bade his veteran
warrior go out to accept it. At the head of a few horsemen, Huang Zhong dashed
across the drawbridge. The two champions engaged, and at the end of half a
hundred bouts neither had the advantage. On both sides the soldiers cheered
lustily.
When the drums were beating most furiously, suddenly Guan Yu wheeled round his
horse and fled. Of course Huang Zhong followed. Just as the moment for the
feint arrived, Guan Yu heard behind him a tremendous crash and turned to see
his pursuer lying prone upon the ground. Huang Zhongâs steed had stumbled and
thrown him.
Guan Yu turned, raised his sword in both hands, and cried in a fierce tone,
âI spare your life, but quick! Get another horse and come again to battle.â
Huang Zhong pulled his horse to its feet hastily, leapt upon its back, and went
into the city at full speed. The Governor was astonished and asked for an
account of the accident.
âThe horse is too old,â replied Huang Zhong.
âWhy did you not shoot since your aim is so perfect?â asked the Governor.
âI will try again tomorrow,â said Huang Zhong. âI will run away as if
overcome, and so tempt him to the drawbridge and then shoot him.â
Han Xuan gave the veteran a gray horse that he usually rode himself. Huang
Zhong thanked him and retired.
But Huang Zhong could not forget Guan Yuâs generous conduct, nor could he
understand it. He could not make up his mind to shoot the man who had spared
his life. Yet if he did not shoot, he betrayed his duty as a soldier. It was
very perplexing, and the whole night spent in thinking it over found him still
undecided.
At daybreak a man came in saying that Guan Yu was near the wall and challenging
them again. So Huang Zhong gave order to go out.
Now Guan Yu, having fought for two days and not having overcome Huang Zhong,
was very ill at ease. So he called up all his dignity when he went forth to
fight that day. When they had got to the thirtieth bout, Huang Zhong fled as if
he was overcome. Guan Yu pursued.
As he rode away, Huang Zhong thought in his heart, âHe spared me only
yesterday, and I cannot bear to shoot him today.â
Putting up his sword, Huang Zhong took his bow and twanged the string only. No
arrow flew. Guan Yu dodged, but seeing no arrow in the air, he retook the
pursuit. Again Huang Zhong twanged an arrowless bowstring, and again Guan Yu
dodged, but no arrow came.
Then Guan Yu said to himself, âHe cannot shoot,â and pressed on in pursuit.
As they neared the city wall, the veteran stopped on the drawbridge, fitted an
arrow, pulled the bow, and sent an arrow flying that just hit the base of the
plume on Guan Yuâs helmet.
The soldiers shouted at the display of marksmanship. Guan Yu was taken aback
and set off for camp with the arrow still sticking. Then he heard that Huang
Zhongâs skill was said to be equal to piercing a willow leaf at a hundred
paces, and Guan Yu understood that he owed this warning in the shape of an
arrow in his plume to gratitude for sparing the veteran the preceding day.
Both withdrew. But when the veteran leader went up on the wall to see the
Governor, he was at once seized.
âWhat have I done?â cried Huang Zhong.
âI have seen these last three days that you were fooling me. You were slack
the day before yesterday, which proved you had some sinister intention.
Yesterday, when your horse stumbled and he spared you, it showed that you were
in league with him. And today you twice twanged a vain bowstring, while at the
third shot you only hit your opponentâs helmet. Dare you say there is no
secret understanding in all this? If I do not put you to death, it will
assuredly redound to my own hurt.â
Han Xuan ordered Huang Zhong to be executed outside the city gate. Han Xuan
also met the intercession of the officers by saying, âAnyone who pleads for
the condemned shall be regarded as in the plot.â
The executioners had hustled the old man out of the city and the sword was in
the air and on the point of descending, when a man suddenly dashed in, cut down
the lictor, and rescued Huang Zhong.
âHuang Zhong is our bulwark!â shouted he. âTo destroy him is to destroy
the Changsha people. This Governor is too fierce and cruel, too lightly values
good people, and is too arrogant toward his officers. We ought rather to kill
him, and those who will, let them follow me.â
All eyes turned toward this bold speaker, who was bronzed and had eyes like the
Cowherdâs star. Some of them knew him as Wei Yan, a native of Yiyang. He
would have followed Liu Bei from Xiangyang but, unable to come up with him, had
gone into the service of Han Xuan. Han Xuan took exception to his arrogant
carriage and lack of polish and neglected him. And so Wei Yan had remained in
the city without office.
After the rescue of Huang Zhong, Wei Yan called upon the people to make an end
of the Governor. He waved his arm and shouted to the people. Soon he had a
following of several hundreds. Huang Zhong could not stop them. In a very short
time, Wei Yan had dashed up on the wall, and Han Xuan lay dead. Taking his
head, Wei Yan rode off out of the city to lay the bloodstained trophy at the
feet of Guan Yu, who forthwith went into the city to restore confidence.
When the people were all quiet, Guan Yu sent to request Huang Zhong to come to
see him, but the old general pleaded illness.
Next Guan Yu sent the good news to his brother and to Zhuge Liang and asked
them to come.
Soon after Guan Yu had left to capture Changsha, Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang had
followed him up with supports in case of need. While on the march, a black flag
was furled backwards and a crow flew over from north to south croaking thrice
as it passed.
âWhat good or evil things do these omens presage?â asked Liu Bei.
With hands hidden within his long sleeves, Zhuge Liang performed a rapid
calculation on his fingers of the auspices and replied, âChangsha is taken
and a great leader mastered. We shall know soon after noon.â
Sure enough a simple soldier presently came galloping along with the welcome
tidings of the capture of the city, and saying that the two city warriors who
had aided them were near waiting the arrival of Liu Bei. Soon after they
arrived, Liu Bei entered the city, where he was escorted to the magistracy and
heard the recital of Huang Zhongâs deeds.
Liu Bei went in person to Huang Zhongâs house and inquired for him, whereupon
Huang Zhong came forth and yielded formally. Huang Zhong requested to be
permitted to bury the remains of the late Governor on the east of the city.
Lofty as is heaven above earth was the spirit of the general,
Who, even in his old age, suffered sorrows in the south;
Cheerfully had he approached death, with no thought of resentment,
But, bowing before the conqueror, he hung his head and was ashamed.
Praise the sword, gleaming snow-white, and the glory of super-human bravery,
Consider the mail-clad steed snuffing the wind and rejoicing in the battle,
That warriorâs name shall stand high and its brightness be undiminished,
While the cold moon sheds her light on the waters of River Xiang.
Liu Bei was generous toward the veteran leader, who had come under his banner,
and was grateful for the service of Wei Yan. He made both of them Van Leaders.
Having given in with good grace, Huang Zhong introduced a nephew of Liu Biao,
named Liu Pan, then living in Yuxian near by. Liu Bei gave Liu Pan the
governorship of Changsha.
All being tranquil at the four territories, Liu Bei and his army returned to
Jingzhou City. The name of Youkou was changed to Gongan, and soon all was
prosperous. Able people from all sides came to assist in the administration.
Guards were placed at strategic points.
When Zhou Yu went to Chaisang to recover from his wound, he left Gan Ning in
command at Baling and Ling Tong at Hanyang. The fleet was shared between these
two places to be ready to move when required. The remainder of the force was
under Cheng Pu, and he went to Hefei, where Sun Quan had been since the fight
at the Red Cliffs. Sun Quan was still fighting the northern army, and in half a
score encounters, small and great, neither had gained a decided advantage. Sun
Quan could not approach the city but entrenched himself about fifteen miles
away.
When Sun Quan heard of the coming of reinforcements of Cheng Pu, he was very
pleased and went in person to meet and welcome the leaders. Lu Su was in
advance of the main body, and Sun Quan dismounted and stood by the roadside to
greet him. As soon as he saw this, Lu Su slid out of the saddle and made his
obeisance.
But the officers were amazed at the attitude of Sun Quan, and still more so
when Sun Quan asked Lu Su to remount and ride by his side.
Presently Sun Quan said secretly to Lu Su, âI, the Lone One, dismounted to
greet you as you saw. Was that manifestation enough for you?â
âNo,â replied Lu Su.
âThen what further can I do?â
âI want to see your authority and virtue spread over the four seas and enfold
the nine regions, and you yourself playing your part as emperor. Then will my
name be inscribed in the annals, and I shall indeed be known.â
Sun Quan clapped his hands and laughed gleefully.
When they reached the camp, a banquet was prepared and the services of the new
arrivals were praised and glorified.
The destruction of Hefei was one day under discussion, when one came in to say
that Zhang Liao had sent a written challenge to battle. Sun Quan tore open the
cover, and what he read therein made him very wrath.
âThis Zhang Liao has insulted me grossly,â said he. âHe hears that Cheng
Pu has arrived and sends a challenge. Tomorrow, O newly-come warriors, you
shall see me fight with him. You shall have no share in the battle.â
Orders were given that next morning the army would move out of camp and advance
on Hefei. Early in the morning, when they had advanced about halfway, they met
the army of Cao Cao and prepared for battle. Sun Quan, with helmet of gold and
breastplate of silver, rode to the front with Song Qian and Jia Hua, each armed
with a halberd to support him and guard him one on each side.
When the third roll of the drum ceased, the center of Cao Caoâs army opened
to allow the exit of three warriors, all fully armed. They were Zhang Liao,
supported by Li Dian and Yue Jing. Zhang Liao, the central figure, especially
designated Sun Quan as the object of his challenge. Sun Quan took his spear and
was about to accept the challenge, from when the ranks behind him came out
Taishi Ci, who galloped forth with his spear ready to thrust. Zhang Liao
whirled up his sword to strike the newcomer, and the two fought near a hundred
bouts without a decisive blow.
Then said Li Dian to Yue Jing, âHe there opposite us with the golden helm is
Sun Quan. Could we but capture him, the loss of our eight hundred thirty
thousand soldiers at the Red Cliffs would be amply avenged.â
So speaking Yue Jing rode out, alone, just one man and one sword, and went
sidelong toward the two combatants. Then suddenly, swift as a flash of
lightning, he ran forward and slashed at Sun Quan. But Sun Quanâs two guards
were too quick for him. Up went the two halberds of Song Qian and Jia Hua
guarding their lordâs head. The blow fell, but on the crossed halberds which
were shorn through near the head, and in another moment they were hammering
away on the head of Yue Jingâs steed with the shafts of their broken weapons
and forcing it back.
Song Qian snatched a spear from a soldier near and went in pursuit of Yue Jing,
but Li Dian, on the other side, fitted an arrow to his bow and aimed at Song
Qianâs heart from behind. And Song Qian fell as the bowstring twanged.
Then Taishi Ci, seeing his colleague fell, left off the fight with Zhang Liao
and returned to his own line. At this Zhang Liao fell on in a swift attack, and
the army of Sun Quan, thrown into confusion, scattered and fled.
Zhang Liao, having distinguished Sun Quan in the distance, galloped in pursuit
and had nearly come up with him, when Cheng Pu happily rushed in from one side
of the line of fight, stayed the pursuit, and saved his master. Zhang Liao
withdrew to Hefei. Sun Quan was escorted back to his main camp, where his
beaten soldiers gradually rejoined him and their ranks were reformed.
When Sun Quan knew of the death of Song Qian, he was greatly pained and wept
aloud.
But Adviser Zhang Hong reproached him, saying, âMy lord, you relied too much
upon your martial prowess and lightly engaged in battle with a formidable
enemy. Every person in the army was chilled with fear, and you lost a general
and some of your banners. It is not for you to exhibit prowess on the actual
battlefield and encroach upon the duties of a general. Rather curb and repress
such physical feats as those ancient Xia Yu and Meng Ben, and contemplate
schemes of exercising princely virtues with the hegemony of all the feudal
states. It is because of your ill-regulated action in engaging in battle that
Song Qian perished at the hands of your enemies. Hereafter you should regard as
most important your personal safety.â
âYes, it is indeed a fault,â said Sun Quan. âI will reform.â
Soon after, Taishi Ci entered the tent and said, âIn my command there is a
certain Ge Ding, brother of a groom in the army of Zhang Liao. This servant is
deeply resentful on account of a punishment inflicted upon him and is anxious
to be revenged. He has sent over to say that he will show a signal tonight when
he has assassinated Zhang Liao in revenge for the death of your late leader
Song Qian. I wish to take some troops over to await this signal to attack.â
âWhere is Ge Ding?â asked Sun Quan.
âGe Ding has mingled with the enemy and gone into the city. Let me have five
thousand soldiers.â
Zhuge Jin said, âZhang Liao is full of guile. I think you will find him
prepared for your coming. Be careful.â
As Taishi Ci urged his chief to let him go, and Sun Quan was deeply hurt by the
death of his leader, the permission was given and the force started.
Now here it must be said that Taishi Ci and this Ge Ding were natives of the
same place. Ge Ding had made his way into the city without detection, found his
brother, and the two had arranged their plot.
Ge Ding also told him, saying, âTaishi Ci will come over tonight to help us.
What need to be done now?â
His brother, the groom, said, âAs the troops of Sun Quan are far away, I fear
they cannot be here tonight, so we will make a huge bonfire of straw and then
you can rush out and cry treachery. That will throw all into confusion and will
give a chance to kill Zhang Liao.â
âThis is an excellent plan,â said Ge Ding.
Now after the victory, Zhang Liao returned to the city and rewarded his
soldiers, but he issued orders that no one was to doff his armor or sleep.
His attendants said, âYou have gained a great victory today, and the enemy
are far away. You might doff your armor and get some repose.â
But Zhang Liao replied, âThat is not the way of a leader. A victory is no
reason for rejoicing, nor should a defeat cause sadness. If those of the South
Land suspect that I am unprepared, they will attack. And we must be ready to
repel them. Be ready tonight and be doubly careful.â
Scarcely had he said this than a fire started and cries of âTreachery!â
arose. Many rushed to tell the leader, who went out and called together his
guard of about half a score. They took up a commanding position in the way.
Those about him said, âThe shouts are insistent. You ought to go and see what
it means.â
âA whole city cannot be traitors,â said Zhang Liao. âSome discontented
person has frightened the soldiers. If I see anyone doing so, I will slay
him.â
Soon after this Li Dian dragged up Ge Ding and his fellow traitor. After a few
brief questions, they were beheaded.
Then arose a great noise, shouting and the rolling of drums was heard outside
the gate.
âThat means the troops of South Land are there to help,â said Zhang Liao.
âBut we will destroy them by a simple ruse.â
He bade them light torches and yell âTreachery! Rebellion!â and throw open
the city gates and let down the drawbridge.
When Taishi Ci saw the gates swing open, he thought his scheme was going well
and in full confidence rode in at the gate. But just at the entrance a signal
bomb suddenly exploded, and the enemy arrows came down on him like pelting
rain. Then he knew he had fallen into a snare and turned to ride out. But he
was wounded in many places. And in the pursuit that followed, more than half
the troops under Taishi Ci were cut off. As he drew near his own lines, a
rescue force led by Lu Xun and Dong Xi came to his aid, and the Cao Caoâs
soldiers ceased from pursuit.
Sun Quan was exceedingly sad when he learned that his faithful general had been
grievously wounded. Then Zhang Zhao prayed him to cease from war, and Sun Quan
was content. They gathered in their soldiers to their ships and sailed to Nanxu
and Runzhou where they camped.
Meanwhile Taishi Ci was dying.
When his lord went to ask how he fared, he cried, âWhen a worthy person is
born into a turbulent world, he has to be a soldier and gird on a three-span
sword to step on the mountains to mend the sky. I have not rendered great
service. Why must I die before I have attained my desire?â
These were his last words. He was forty-one years of age.
Single minded and perfectly loyal,
Such was Taishi Ci, in Donglai,
Far distant frontiers rang with his exploits,
Riding or archery, all humans he excelled,
One in Bohai who admired his valor,
Cared for his mother while he was fighting,
How he roared in the battle at Shenting!
Dying, he spoke as a hero;
All through the ages people sigh for his fate.
Sun Quan was exceedingly grieved when this second of his leaders died. He gave
orders to bury his remains most honorably outside the north wall of Nanxu on
Beigu Hill and took his son, Taishi Heng, into his own palace to be brought up.
In Jingzhou, when Liu Bei heard of the series of misfortunes that had befallen
Sun Quan and of his retirement to Nanxu, he and Zhuge Liang discussed their
plans.
Said Zhuge Liang, âI was studying the sky and saw a falling star in the
northwest. The imperial family is to suffer a loss.â
Zhuge Liang had scarcely said this when they brought news of the death of Liu
Qi, son of Liu Biao.
Liu Bei at once began to wail bitterly.
But his adviser said to him, âLife and death are beyond our control,
wherefore weep not, my lord, for grief harms the body. Rather consider what is
necessary to be done. Send someone to assume control and make arrangements for
the interment.â
âWho can go?â asked Liu Bei.
âNo other than Guan Yu.â
So they sent Guan Yu to guard the city of Xiangyang.
Liu Bei at once began to feel troubled about his promise to surrender Jingzhou
on the death of Liu Qi. Zhuge Liang did not consider this a matter of moment.
Zhuge Liang said, âI will have somewhat to say to anyone who comes to ask
fulfillment of the promise.â
In half a month it was announced that Lu Su would come to mourn at the funeral.
To claim the promise one will come,
But they will send him empty home.
What reply Zhuge Liang made may be read in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 54 ****
Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang went out of the city to welcome the envoy of the South
Land and led him to the guest-house.
After the usual greetings, Lu Su said, âHearing of the death of your nephew,
my lord Sun Quan has prepared some gifts and sent me to take his place at the
funeral sacrifices. General Zhou Yu also sends regards to the Imperial Uncle
and to you, Master Zhuge Liang.â
Both rose at once and thanked him for the courtesy. Then the gifts were handed
over and a banquet prepared, and while it was in progress, the guest brought up
the real object of his visit.
âYou said, Sir, that Jingzhou should be returned to us after the death of Liu
Qi. Now that that event has happened, rendition becomes due, and I should be
glad to know when the transfer can take place.â
âWe will discuss that later. In the meantime let us go on with our wine,â
said Liu Bei.
So the feasting continued. Some time later Lu Su returned to the subject, but
this time his host remained silent.
However, Zhuge Liang, changing color, said, âLu Su, you are unreasonable. You
could not wait till some other has to explain this matter to you. From the very
foundation of the empire by our illustrious ancestor, the great heritage has
descended in due course till today when, unhappily, evil doers have risen among
the powerful and they have seized upon such portions as they could. But with
Godâs favor and help, unity is nearly restored. My lord is a scion of the
Imperial House, a great great grandson of Emperor Jing. Now, as the Emperorâs
Uncle, should he not have a share of the empire? Moreover, Liu Biao was my
lordâs elder brother, and there is certainly nothing extraordinary in one
brotherâs succession to anotherâs estate.
âWhat is your master? The son of a petty official on the banks of the River
Qiantang, absolutely without merit so far as the state is concerned. Just
because he is powerful, he holds actual possession of six territories and
eighty-one counties, which has whetted his insatiable appetite till he now
desires to swallow the whole empire. The land is the estate of the Liu family
and my lord, who is of that name, has no share thereof, while your master,
whose name is Sun, would dispute with, and even fight him. Beside, at the
battle at the Red Cliffs my lord did good service and acquired great merit
while his commanders risked their lives. Was it solely the strength of your
southern soldiers that won that fight? Had I not brought that southeast wind
that meant so much for Zhou Yu, could he have done anything? Had the South Land
been conquered, it is needless to say that the two paramount beauties would now
be gracing the Bronze Bird Palace. And as for yourself and other officers,
insignificant though your families be, could you have been sure to survive?
Just now my lord did not reply because he was willing to believe rather that a
scholar of your abilities would understand without a detailed explanation, and
I trust now that you will.â
This speech absolutely shut the guestâs mouth for a time, and he said no word
in reply. But after an interval he said, âWhat you say, Zhuge Liang, I think
is devoid of reason, and means much unpleasantness for me.â
âWhat unpleasantness?â asked Zhuge Liang.
The guest replied, âWhen Liu Bei was in serious straits at Dangyang, I
conducted you across the river and introduced you to my lord. I opposed Zhou Yu
when he was going to capture Jingzhou, and then it came to agreement that the
place was to be ours when the young man died. And I pledged myself to that. Now
how can I go back and say you break your promise? Both my lord and Zhou Yu will
hold me guilty. I would not mind death so much, but I fear that my master will
be very wrathful and make war on the Imperial Uncle, who will have no place of
refuge and he will look ridiculous in the eyes of the world for no reason.â
Replied Zhuge Liang, âI care not for Cao Cao with his million troops and the
Emperor in name at his back, and do you think I fear such a youngster as Zhou
Yu? However, as it may cause you some loss of consideration, I will try to
persuade my master to put the matter in writing and give you a paper to the
effect that he is temporarily occupying Jingzhou as a base. When he can obtain
possession of some other city, this shall be returned to you. What think you
the South Land would say to this?â
âWait till what other place was obtained?â said Lu Su.
âMy master can scarcely think of attacking the Middle Land yet, but Liu Zhang
in Yizhou is ignorant and weak, and my master will attack him. If he gets the
western region, then this place will be given up to you.â
Lu Su had no alternative and accepted the offer. Liu Bei with his own hand
wrote the pledge and sealed it. Zhuge Liang being named as guarantor also
signed the document.
âSince I belong to this side of the compact and one can hardly have a
guarantor of the same party, I would trouble you, Lu Su, also to sign. It will
look better when you reach the South Land again,â said Zhuge Liang.
Lu Su said, âI know that your master is perfectly honorable and will adhere
to the bargain.â
And so Lu Su signed. Then he received the document in formal style and took his
departure. He was sent off with every mark of great respect, both Liu Bei and
Zhuge Liang attending him to his boat.
There the Directing Instructor delivered him a last exhortation, âWhen you
see your master, speak discreetly and explain fully so as not to create a bad
impression. If he rejects our document, we may get angry and we will take his
whole country. The one thing now is for our two houses to live in harmony and
not give our common enemy, Cao Cao, an opportunity against us.â
Lu Su went down into his ship. He reached Chaisang and there saw Zhou Yu, who
said, âWell, how did you speed with your demand for Jingzhou?â
âHere is the document,â said Lu Su, giving it to Zhou Yu to read.
âYou have been victimized by Zhuge Liang!â said Zhou Yu, stamping his foot
with irritation. âIn name it may be temporary occupation, but in fact it is
humbug. They say the place is to be returned when they get the west. Who knows
when that will be? Suppose ten years: Then it will be ten years before they
give us Jingzhou. What is the use of such a document as this? And you are a
guarantor of its due performance! If they do not give us the city, you get into
trouble. Suppose our lord finds you in the wrong, what then?â
Lu Su was dumbfounded. When he had somewhat recovered his self-possession, he
said, âI think Liu Bei will be true to me.â
âYou, my friend, are simple and sincere. Liu Bei is a scoundrel adventurer,
and Zhuge Liang is a slippery customer. They and you are utterly different.â
âWhat then is to be done?â cried Lu Su distressfully.
âYou are my dear friend, and your kindness in freely offering your store of
grain to relieve my army is still fresh in my memory. Of course I will save
you. Do not be anxious, but wait a few days till we get news of what is doing
on the north of the river, and then we can decide upon a plan.â
Lu Su passed some very uneasy days. Then the scouts came back saying that in
Jingzhou everything seemed in excellent order and the white flags were flying
everywhere, while outside the city they were building a magnificent mausoleum
for Lady Gan, wife of Liu Bei. All the soldiers were in mourning.
When Zhou Yu knew who was dead, he said to Lu Su, âMy scheme is made. You
will see Liu Bei just stand still to be bound, and we shall get Jingzhou like
turning a hand.â
âWhat is the main spring of your plan?â said Lu Su.
âLiu Bei will want to remarry, and our lord has a sister, Sun Ren. She is a
tough lady, whose women guards number many hundreds, all armed with weapons of
war. Her apartments also are full of such things. I will write to our lord to
send an intermediary to arrange that the lady shall wed Liu Bei at her family
home, and thus we shall entice Liu Bei to Nanxu. But instead of marrying a
wife, Liu Bei will find himself a prisoner, and then we will demand Jingzhou as
ransom. When they have handed over the region, I shall find something else to
say and nothing will fall on your head.â
Lu Su was very grateful. Then Zhou Yu wrote letters to his master, and a swift
boat was chosen to take Lu Su to see the Marquis of Wu.
After the lending of Jingzhou had been discussed, Lu Su presented the document
given him by Liu Bei.
âWhat is the use of such nonsense as this?â said Sun Quan, when he had read
it.
âThere is another letter from General Zhou Yu. And he says that if you will
employ his scheme, you can recover Jingzhou,â replied Lu Su.
Having read that letter, Sun Quan was more pleased and began to consider who
was the best person to send.
Suddenly he cried, âI have it. Lu Fan is the man to send.â
Sun Quan called Lu Fan and said to him, âI have just heard that Liu Bei has
lost his wife. I have a sister whom I should like to marry to him and so make a
bond of union between our two houses. Thus we should be united against Cao Cao
and in support of the House of Han. You are the one man to be intermediary, and
I hope you will go to Jingzhou and see to this.â
Under these orders, Lu Fan at once began to prepare his ships for the voyage
and soon started.
Liu Bei was greatly distressed at the death of Lady Gan, fretting for her day
and night. One day when he was talking with his adviser, they announced the
arrival of Lu Fan who had come on a mission from the South Land.
âOne of Zhou Yuâs devices,â said Zhuge Liang smiling, âand it is all on
account of this region. I will just retire behind the screen and listen. But
you, my lord, agree to whatever the messenger proposes. Then let the messenger
be taken to the guest-house while we arrange what is to be done.â
So the envoy was introduced. Bows having been exchanged, host and guest being
seated in due order and the tea drunk, Liu Bei opened the interview.
âYou must have some commands for me, Sir, since you come thus.â
âNews has just been received that you, O Imperial Uncle, have just been
bereaved of your consort. I venture to hope you would not object to an
advantageous match, and I have come to propose one. Are you disposed to
listen?â
âTo lose oneâs wife in middle age is truly a great misfortune,â said Liu
Bei. âWhile her body is still warm, I cannot listen to proposals for another
marriage.â
Lu Fan said, âA man without a wife is like a house without a ridge pole. At
your age, one should not live an incomplete life. I am come on the part of
Marquis Sun Quan, who has a sister, beautiful as she is, accomplished and well
fitted to be a mate for you. Should the two families become allied as formerly
were Qin and Jin, then that ruffian Cao Cao would never dare so much as look
this way. Such an alliance would be to the benefit of both our houses and of
the state. I hope, O Imperial Uncle, that you will fairly consider the
proposal. However, since the young girlâs mother is dotingly fond of her, the
mother does not wish her to go far away, and so I must ask you to come into our
country for the wedding.â
âDoes the Marquis know of your coming?â
âHow dare I come without his knowledge?â
âI am no longer young,â said Liu Bei. âI am fifty and grizzled. This fair
damsel, the sister of the Marquis, is now in the flower of her youth and no
mate for me.â
âAlthough the damsel is a woman, yet in mind she surpasses many a man, and
she has said she will never wed anyone who is unknown to fame. Now, Sir, you
are renowned throughout the four seas. Marriage with you would be the chaste
maiden mating with the born gentleman. Of what consequence is the difference in
age?â
âSir, stay here awhile, and I will give you a reply tomorrow,â said Liu
Bei.
So that day the envoy was entertained at a banquet and then conducted to the
guest-house to repose, while, late as it was, Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang discussed
their plans.
âI knew what he had come about,â said the adviser. âWhile he was talking,
I consulted the oracle and obtained an excellent sign. Wherefore you may accept
the proposal and send Sun Qian back with this envoy to arrange the details.
When the promise has been ratified, we will choose a day and you shall go to
complete the ceremony.â
âHow can I thus go into enemy territory? Zhou Yu has wanted to slay me for a
long time.â
âLet Zhou Yu employ all his ruses. Think you he can get beyond me? Let me act
for you, and his calculations will always fail halfway. Once Sun Quanâs
sister is in your power, there will be no fear for Jingzhou.â
Still Liu Bei doubted in his mind. However, Sun Qian was sent to the South
Land, with definite instructions, and traveled thither with Lu Fan.
At the interview Sun Quan said, âI wish my sister could induce Liu Bei to
live here with us. He would come to no harm.â
Sun Qian took his leave. And returning to Jingzhou, he told the bridegroom
elect, saying, âSun Quanâs sole desire is for our lord to go over and
complete the marriage.â
However, Liu Bei feared and would not go.
Zhuge Liang said, âI have prepared three plans, but I need Zhao Zilong to
carry them out. He will be sent as your guard.â
So Zhuge Liang called in Zhao Zilong, gave him three silken bags, and whispered
in his ear, saying, âHere are three schemes enclosed in three bags. When you
escort our lord to the South Land, you will take these with you and act as they
direct.â
Zhao Zilong hid the three silken bags in his breast so that they should be at
hand when required.
Zhuge Liang next sent the wedding gifts, and when these had been received, the
preliminaries were settled.
It was then the early winter of the fourteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD
209). The bridegroom elect, his escort, and the intermediary left the city of
Jingzhou with a fleet of ten fast ships to sail down the river to Nanxu. Zhuge
Liang remained to guard and rule the region.
But Liu Bei was far from feeling comfortable. They arrived and the ships were
made fast. This done, the time had come for the first of the silken bags to be
opened. And so it was. Thereupon Zhao Zilong gave each of his five hundred
guards his instructions, and they went their several ways. Next Zhao Zilong
told Liu Bei what he was to do: To pay his visit first to the State Patriarch
Qiao, who was the father-in-law of Sun Ce and of Zhou Yu.
The State Patriarch Qiao resided in Nanxu and to his house, leading sheep and
bearing wine jars, went the bridegroom elect. Having made his obeisance, Liu
Bei explained that as Lu Fan had arranged, he had come to marry a wife.
In the meantime the five hundred guards, all in gala dress, had scattered over
the city place buying all sorts of things, as they said, for the wedding of Liu
Bei with the daughter of the Sun House. They spread the news far and wide and
the whole town talked about it.
When Sun Quan heard of Liu Beiâs arrival, he bade Lu Fan wait upon him and
take him to the guest-house. Meanwhile the State Patriarch Qiao went to the
Dowager Marchioness, mother of Sun Quan, to congratulate her on the happy
event.
âWhat happy event?â ejaculated the old lady.
âThe betrothal of your beloved daughter to Liu Bei. And he has arrived too,
as surely you know.â
âMy poor old self does not know,â said the Dowager. âI have heard nothing
of all this.â
She at once summoned her son and also sent her servants out into the town to
see what was going about.
They quickly returned to say: âThe whole city know of the coming wedding, and
the bridegroom is now at the guest-house. Moreover, he has come with a large
escort, and they are spending freely, buying pork and mutton and fruits, all in
readiness for the wedding feasting. Lu Fan and Sun Qian are the intermediaries
on each side, and they are in the guest-house too.â
The Dowager Marchioness was terribly taken aback and upset so that, when Sun
Quan arrived, he found his mother beating her breast and weeping bitterly.
âWhat has disturbed you, Mother?â asked he.
âWhat you have just done,â said she. âYou have treated me as a nonentity.
When my elder sister lay dying, what did she tell you?â
Sun Quan began to be frightened, but he said boldly, âPlease speak out
plainly, Mother. What is this great sorrow?â
âWhen a son is grown, he takes a wife; and when a girl is old enough, she
goes to her husband. And that is right and proper. But I am the mother, and you
ought to have told me that your sister was to become the wife of Liu Bei. Why
did you keep me in the dark? It was my place to promise her in marriage.â
âWhence comes this story?â said the Marquis, really much frightened.
âDo you pretend ignorance? There is not a soul in the city who does not know!
But you have succeeded in keeping me in the dark.â
âI heard it several days ago,â said the State Patriarch Qiao. âAnd I came
just now to offer my felicitations.â
âThere is no such thing,â said Sun Quan. âIt is just one of the ruses of
Zhou Yu to get hold of Jingzhou. He has used this means to inveigle Liu Bei
here and hold him captive till Jingzhou is restored to us. And if they will not
give it back, then Liu Bei will be put to death. That is the plot. There is no
real marriage.â
But the Dowager was in a rage and vented her wrath in abusing Zhou Yu.
She said, âZhou Yu is a pretty sort of governor over the six territories and
eighty-one counties, if he cannot find any means of recovering one region
except making use of my child as a decoy. Truly this is a fine deed, to spoil
the whole of my childâs life and condemn her to perpetual widowhood, because
he wants to use the fair damsel ruse to slay a man! Who will ever come to talk
of marriage with her after this?â
Said the State Patriarch Qiao, âBy this means you may indeed recover
Jingzhou, but you will be a shameful laughing stock to all the world. What can
be done?â
Sun Quan had nothing to say. He could only hang his head, while the Dowager
abused his general.
The State Patriarch Qiao tried to soothe her, saying, âAfter all Liu Bei, the
Imperial Uncle, is a scion of the reigning family. You can do nothing better
now than to welcome him as a son-in-law and not let this ugly story get
abroad.â
âI am afraid their ages do not match,â interposed Sun Quan.
âLiu Bei is a very famous man,â said the State Patriarch Qiao. âThere can
be no shame in having such a son-in-law.â
âI have never seen him,â said the Dowager. âArrange that I may get a look
at him tomorrow at the Sweet Dew Temple. If he displeases me, you may work your
will on him. But if I am satisfied with him, then I shall simply let the girl
marry him.â
Now Sun Quan was above all things filial and at once agreed to what his mother
said. He went out, called in Lu Fan, and told him to arrange a banquet for the
morrow at the temple so that the Dowager Marchioness might see the bridegroom.
âWhy not order Jia Hua to station some men in the wings of the temple? Then
if the Dowager be not pleased, we can call them out and fall upon him,â said
Lu Fan.
Accordingly the ambush was prepared and five hundred ruffians posted to act as
the Dowagerâs attitude might determine.
When the State Patriarch Qiao took his leave and had reached his house, he sent
to tell Liu Bei, saying, âTomorrow the Marquis and the Dowager Marchioness
wished to see you. So be careful!â
Liu Bei and his faithful henchman discussed their plans.
Zhao Zilong said, âThe morrow bodes rather ill than well. However, your
escort shall be there.â
Next day the Dowager Marchioness and the State Patriarch Qiao went to the
Temple of Sweet Dew as had been arranged. Sun Quan came with a number of his
strategists; and when all were assembled, Lu Fan was sent to the guest-house to
request Liu Bei to come. He obeyed the summons, but as a precaution he put on a
light coat of mail under his brocaded robe. His followers too took their swords
upon their backs and followed close. He mounted his steed, and the cavalcade
set out for the temple. At the door of the temple he met Sun Quan on whom the
visitorâs brave demeanor was not lost. After they had exchanged salutations,
Sun Quan led Liu Bei into the presence of his mother.
âJust the son-in-law for me!â said the Dowager delighted with the
appearance of Liu Bei.
âHe has the air of an emperor and a look like the sun,â remarked the State
Patriarch Qiao. âWhen one remembers also that his fair fame has spread over
the whole earth, you may well be congratulated on getting such a noble son-in-
law.â
Liu Bei bowed, in acknowledgment of his reception. Soon after they were all
seated at the banquet in the temple, Zhao Zilong entered and took his place
beside Liu Bei.
âWho is this?â asked the Dowager.
âThis is Zhao Zilong of Changshan.â
âThen he must be the hero of Dangyang, who saved the little Liu Shan.â
âYes, this is he,â replied Liu Bei.
âA fine general!â said the Dowager, and she gave him wine.
Presently Zhao Zilong said to his master, âI have seen a lot of armed
ruffians hidden away in the purlieus of the temple. They can be there for no
good, and you should ask the Dowager to get them sent away.â
Thereupon Liu Bei knelt at the feet of the Dowager and, weeping, said, âIf
you would slay me, let it be here.â
âWhy do you say this?â asked she.
âBecause there are assassins in hiding in the wings of the temple. What are
they there for if not to kill me?â
The Dowager wrathfully turned on Sun Quan, âWhat are armed men doing there
today, when Liu Bei is to become my son-in-law and the pair are my son and
daughter?â
Sun Quan said he did not know and sent Lu Fan to inquire. Lu Fan put the blame
on Jia Hua. The Dowager summoned him and upbraided him severely. He had nothing
to say, and she told them to put him to death.
But Liu Bei interceded, saying, âThe Generalâs death will do me harm and
make it hard for me to stay at your side.â
The State Patriarch Qiao also interceded, and she only ordered the general out
of her presence. His subordinates also scattered and ran like frightened rats.
By and bye, strolling out of the banquet room into the temple grounds, Liu Bei
came to a boulder. Drawing his sword he looked up to heaven and prayed, saying,
âIf I am to return to Jingzhou and achieve my intent to become a chief ruler,
then may I cleave this boulder asunder with my sword. But if I am to meet my
doom in this place, then may the sword fail to cut this stone.â
Raising his sword he smote the boulder. Sparks flew in all directions, and the
boulder lay split in twain.
It happened that Sun Quan had seen the blow, and he said, âWhy do you thus
hate that stone?â
Liu Bei replied, âI am near my fifth decade and have so far failed to rid the
state of evil. I greatly regret my failure. Now I have been accepted by the
Dowager as her son-in-law, and this is a critical moment in my life. So I
implored of Heaven a portent that I might destroy Cao Cao as I would that
boulder and restore the dynasty. You saw what happened.â
âThat is only to deceive me,â thought Sun Quan. Drawing his own sword, he
said, âAnd I also ask of Heaven an omen, that if I am to destroy Cao Cao, I
may also cut this rock.â
So he spoke. But in his secret heart he prayed, âIf I am to recover Jingzhou
and extend my borders, may the stone be cut in twain.â
He smote the stone and it split in twain. And to this day there are cross cuts
in the stone, which is still preserved.
One who saw this relic wrote a poem:
The shining blades fell and the rock was shorn through,
The metal rang clear and the sparks widely flew.
Thus fate then declared for the dynasties two
And the tripartite rule there began.
Both put up their swords and returned hand in hand to the banquet hall.
After some more courses, Sun Qian gave his master a warning look, and Liu Bei
said, âI pray you excuse me as my drinking powers are very small.â
Wherefore Sun Quan escorted him to the gate.
As they walked down looking at high land and rolling river spreading in
glorious panorama before their eyes, Liu Bei exclaimed, âReally this is the
finest scene in the whole world!â
These words are recorded on a tablet in the Temple of the Sweet Dew, and one
who read them wrote a poem:
From the riverside hills the rain clears off,
And the black clouds roll away,
And this is the place of joy and mirth
And never can sorrow stay.
And here two heroes of ages past
Decided their parts to play,
And the lofty heights flung back wind and wave
Then, as they do today.
Yes, they stood both entranced by the beautiful scene. And gradually along the
vast river the wind whipped the waves into snowy foam and raised them high
toward heaven. And in the midst of the waves appeared a tiny leaf of a boat
riding over the waves as if all was perfect calm.
âThe northern people are riders and the southern people sailors. It is said
quite true,â sighed Liu Bei.
Sun Quan hearing this remark took it as a reproach to his horsemanship. Bidding
his servants lead up his steed, Sun Quan leaped into the saddle and set off,
full gallop, down the hill. Then wheeling he came up again at the same speed.
âSo the southerners cannot ride, eh?â said Sun Quan laughing.
Not to be outdone, Liu Bei lifted the skirts of his robe, jumped upon his horse
and repeated the feat.
The two steeds stood side by side on the declivity, the riders flourishing
their whips and laughing.
Thence forward that hillside was known as the âSlope Where the Horses
Stood,â and a poem was written about it:
Their galloping steeds were of noble breed,
And both of spirit high,
And the riders twain from the hill-crest gazed
At the river rolling by.
One of them mastered the western mountains.
One ruled by the eastern sea;
And the hill to this very day
Still is the Slope Where the Horses Stood.
When they rode side by side into Nanxu, the people met them with acclamations.
Liu Bei made his way to the guest-house and there sought advice from Sun Qian
as to the date of the wedding.
Sun Qian advised, âIt should be fixed as early as possible so that no further
complications could arise.â
So next day Liu Bei went to the State Patriarch Qiao and told him in plain
words, âMany the people of the place mean harm to me, and I cannot stay here
long. I must return soon.â
âDo not be anxious,â said the State Patriarch Qiao. âI will tell the
Dowager Marchioness, and she will protect you.â
Liu Bei bowed to express his thanks.
The State Patriarch Qiao saw the Dowager, and she was very angry when she heard
the reason for Liu Beiâs desire to leave.
âWho would dare harm my son-in-law?â cried she.
But she made Liu Bei move into the library of the palace as a precaution, and
she chose a day for the celebration of the wedding. But his soldiers could not
keep guard at the library and were removed from his commands. Liu Bei explained
to his hostess, and when she understood this, she gave her son-in-law and his
people rooms in her own palace so that he might be quite safe.
Liu Bei was very happy, and there were fine banquets, and the bride and
bridegroom duly plighted their troth. And when it grew late and the guests had
gone, the newly wedded pair walked through the two lines of red torches to the
nuptial apartment.
To his extreme surprise, Liu Bei found the chambers furnished with spears and
swords and banners and flags, while every waiting-maid had girded on a sword.
Walls hung with spears the bridegroom saw,
And armed waiting-maids;
His heart fell back on all its fears
Of well-laid ambuscades.
What happened will be related in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 55 ****
The bridegroom turned pale. Bridal apartments lined with weapons of war and
waiting maids armed!
But the housekeeper of the lady said, âDo not be frightened, O Honorable One!
My lady has always had a taste for warlike things, and her maids have all been
taught fencing as a pastime. That is all it is.â
âNot the sort of thing a wife should ever look at,â said Liu Bei. âIt
makes me feel cold, and you may have them removed for a time.â
The housekeeper went to her mistress and said, âThe weapons in your chamber
displease the handsome one. May we remove them?â
Lady Sun laughed, saying, âAfraid of a few weapons after half a life time
spent in slaughter!â
But she ordered their removal and bade the maids take off their swords while
they were at work.
That night Liu Bei and Lady Sun conversed under the moonlight, and the night
passed happily enough.
Next day Liu Bei distributed gifts among the maids to secure their good will.
He also sent Sun Qian to Jingzhou with news of the wedding, while he gave
himself up to feasting and enjoyment. The Dowager loved him more every day.
The results of the plot to destroy Liu Bei were thus very different from the
originatorsâ intention. Sun Quan sent to his general:
âMy mother had insisted upon marrying her daughter to Liu Bei; and so by
juggling with the fictitious, we had made it real. What is to be done?â
The news troubled Zhou Yu day and night, but eventually he thought but another
scheme which he embodied in a letter sent to his master. Here is the outline of
the missive:
âContrary to expectation, the plot that I, Zhou Yu, contrived has turned the
wrong way. However, since by juggling with deceit, we have ended in a solid
truth. Our future plans must start from the actual present facts. To the
boldness of the adventurer Liu Bei is added the aid of such great leaders as
Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhao Zilong, not to mention that he has a strategist
like Zhuge Liang. He is not the man to remain long in a lowly position.
Wherefore I can think of no better plan than to enervate him by surrounding him
with softness and keeping him in the South Land, a prisoner of luxury.
Therefore build for him a fine palace to blunt the edge of his determination
and surround him with sensuous luxury. In this way the affection of his
brothers will be alienated, and Zhuge Liang will be driven away. When this
result has been attained, we can smite him and so end a great matter. If we be
at all careless, I fear the recumbent dragon may fly to the skies; it is no
beast to be kept in a pond. My lord, I pray you consider this thoroughly.â
The letter was shown to Zhang Zhao who said, âMy idea is identical with his.
Liu Bei began life in a humble position and for years has been a wanderer. He
has never tasted the delights of wealth. Give him the means of luxury, a
beautiful dwelling, fair women, gold and silken attire. As he enjoys them, the
thoughts of Zhuge Liang and his brothers will fade away and they, on their
side, will be filled with rancor. Thus can we lay our plans for recovering
Jingzhou. I recommend action as Zhou Yu says and quickly.â
Sun Quan then set about redecorating the Eastern Palace and laying out the
grounds. He filled the rooms with beautiful furniture for his sister and her
husband. He also sent fair damsels and musicians by the score, and many and
beautiful vessels in gold and silver, and silken stuffs. And his mother was
delighted at his kindness to her son-in-law.
Indeed Liu Bei was soon so immersed in sensuous pleasure that he gave no
thought to return. Zhao Zilong and the company under him led an idle life in
the front portion of the Eastern Palace, save that at times they went outside
the city for archery and horse-racing. And thus passed the year.
Suddenly Zhao Zilong remembered the orders he had received and the three bags
with the plans in them. It was time to open the second one for the end of the
year was nigh. His orders were only to open the third when danger was very near
and there appeared no way out.
As already remarked, the year was drawing to a close, and Zhao Zilong saw his
lord daily becoming more and more the slave of pleasure. Liu Bei never appeared
among his guards now. So the bag was opened and in pursuance of the wonderful
scheme thereby discovered, Zhao Zilong went to the hall of the palace and asked
to see his master.
The maid in attendance went within and said, âZhao Zilong has some important
matter on which to see the master.â
Liu Bei called him in and asked what the business was.
Zhao Zilong assumed an attitude of great concern and said, âMy lord, you are
living happily secluded in these beautiful apartments. Do you never think of
Jingzhou?â
âBut what is the matter that you seem so disturbed?â asked Liu Bei.
âToday early Zhuge Liang sent a messenger to say that Cao Cao was trying to
avenge his last defeat and was leading five hundred thousand troops to attack
Jingzhou, which was in great danger. And he wished you to return.â
âI must speak to my wife,â said Liu Bei.
âIf you consult her, she will be unwilling for you to return. It would be
better to say nothing but to start this evening. Delay may do great damage.â
âRetire for a time. I must act discreetly,â said Liu Bei.
Zhao Zilong urged the need to return several times more, but finally went away.
Liu Bei went into his wifeâs rooms and began to weep silently.
Seeing his tears, Lady Sun said, âWhy are you so sad, my husband?â
Liu Bei replied, âI have been driven hither and thither all my life. I was
never able to do my duty to my parents, nor have I been able to sacrifice to my
ancestors. I have been very unfilial. The new year is at hand, and its approach
disquiets me greatly.â
âDo not try to deceive me,â said Lady Sun. âI heard and I know all. Just
now Zhao Zilong came to tell you Jingzhou was threatened and you wish to return
home. That is why you put forward this excuse.â
Then Liu Bei fell on his knees and said, âWhy should I dissemble, O Wife,
since you know? I do not wish to go, but if Jingzhou be lost, I shall be an
object of ridicule to everyone. I do desire to go, but I cannot leave you. Now
you know why I am grieved.â
She replied, âI am your handmaid, and whithersoever you go, it is my duty to
follow.â
âYes, your heart is right. But the difficulty is your mother and the Marquis.
They will be unwilling. If you would have pity on me and let me go for a time
ââ-â
And again the tears gushed forth.
âDo not be so sad, my husband,â said Lady Sun. âI will implore my mother
to let us go, and she will surely allow it.â
âEven supposing the Dowager permits, I am sure the Marquis will hinder.â
Lady Sun said nothing for a long time while she weighed the matter thoroughly.
Presently she spoke, âOn New Yearâs Day you and I will go to court and
present our congratulations. Then we will give the excuse of a sacrifice on the
river bank and go away without formal leave. Will that suit you?â
Liu Bei knelt at her feet and expressed his gratitude.
âI should be never so grateful,â said he. âDead or alive I would remember
your love. But this must be a perfect secret.â
This having been decided and the arrangements made.
Liu Bei gave Zhao Zilong secret orders, saying, âLead your company out of the
city and be on the road on New Yearâs morn. We are going away.â
Sun Quan held a grand court on the New Yearâs Day of the fifteenth year of
Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 210).
Liu Bei and his bride went into the Dowager Marchionessâ presence, and Lady
Sun said, âMy husband has been thinking of his ancestors, who lie in the
county of Zhuo, and grieves that he cannot do his duty by them. Today we wish
to go to the river side and offer sacrifice toward the north. It is our duty to
inform you.â
âA very filial proceeding,â said the Dowager. âI should not think of
stopping you. Although you have never known your husbandâs parents, yet you
may go with him to sacrifice as it is proper for a wife to do.â
Both thanked the Dowager Marchioness and went out, rejoicing at having so far
hoodwinked Sun Quan. Lady Sun got into her carriage taking only a little
clothing with her, while Liu Bei followed with a small escort. They went out of
the city of Nanxu and met Zhao Zilong at the place arranged. Then with a guard
in front and rear, they left the precincts of the city, traveling as quickly as
they could.
That day, at the new year banquet, Sun Quan drank freely so that he had to be
helped to his chamber, and the guests left. Before very long the escape of the
fugitives became known, but it was then dark, and when they tried to tell Sun
Quan, they could not rouse him. He slept heavily until the fifth watch.
The next morning, when Sun Quan heard the story, he asked advice of his
counselors.
Zhang Zhao said, âThey have got away today, but trouble will surely come of
it. Therefore, pursue after them without loss of time.â
So Chen Wu and Pan Zhang, with five hundred of veterans, were sent out with
orders to use all speed both by day and by night and bring back the fugitives.
They left. Sun Quanâs anger burned hot against Liu Bei. In his wrath he
seized his jade inkstone and dashed it to the ground where it shivered to
pieces.
Said Cheng Pu, âMy lord, your wrath is in vain, for I do not think your
generals will catch the runaways.â
âWill they dare to disobey my order?â said Sun Quan.
âOur young lady had always delighted to look upon war and is very fierce and
determined. All the officers fear her. Now she has gone with her husband of her
own free will; and those sent in pursuit, if once they look upon her
countenance, will not dare to lay hands on her.â
Sun Quanâs wrath burned the more fiercely at these words.
He drew the sword girded at his side and called up Jiang Qin and Zhou Tai,
saying, âYou two take this sword and bring back the heads of my sister and
Liu Bei. And if you do not, I will put you to death.â
With this order they set out in pursuit, leading a whole thousand troops.
Meanwhile Liu Bei and his wife were pressing forward with all speed. When night
fell, they rested for a time by the roadside, but not for long. Just as they
reached the confines of Chaisang, they turned and saw a great cloud of dust and
the soldiers said that a force was coming in pursuit.
âWhat shall we do if they come up with us?â said Liu Bei excitedly to Zhao
Zilong.
âMy lord, you go on in front and I will prevent pursuit.â
As they turned the foot of a hill, they saw a troop of soldiers blocking their
road in front.
Two generals were there and they bellowed, âLiu Bei, dismount and yield
yourself captive. We are here by order of General Zhou Yu, and you have kept us
waiting long!â
Now the thought had come to Zhou Yu that Liu Bei would try to flee, and so he
had sent Xu Sheng and Ding Feng, with three thousand troops, to intercept him
at this critical spot. They had made a camp there and kept a lookout from the
hilltops, for Zhou Yu had calculated that Liu Bei would certainly pass that
way. So when Liu Bei and his cavalcade appeared, they all buckled on their arms
and barred the way.
Greatly fearing, Liu Bei rode back to consult Zhao Zilong, to whom he said,
âIn front a force barring the road; in rear pursuers. There is no escape.
What can we do?â
âDo not be alarmed, my lord. The Directing Instructor gave me three plans
enclosed in three silken bags. Two have been used and have answered admirably.
There is yet the third, and my orders were to open the bag in such a strait as
this. This is a day of great danger such as calls me to open the bag.â
Thereupon Zhao Zilong opened the bag and handed it to Liu Bei.
As soon as Liu Bei had seen the contents, he hastened to Lady Sunâs carriage
and began to weep, saying, âI have something private to say, and I must tell
you.â
âWhat have you to tell me, my husband? Tell me the whole truth,â replied
she.
âYour brother and Zhou Yu formerly made a plot for you to marry me, not for
your sake, but to get me into their power and hold me so that they might
recover Jingzhou. They were set on my murder, and you were the bait with which
to hook me. Careless of consequences I came, for I knew that the spirit of a
heroine dwelt in your bosom and you would pity me. Lately I heard that harm was
intended me, and so I made danger to Jingzhou the excuse to escape. Happily for
me you have remained true and come with me. But now the Marquis is pursuing us,
and Zhou Yuâs soldiers are in front. Only you, my wife, can extricate us from
this danger; and if you refuse, then slay me where I stand that I may thus show
my gratitude for your kindness.â
Lady Sun grew angry and said, âThen does my brother forget that I am his
sister? How will he ever look me in the face? I can extricate us from this
danger.â
Thereupon she bade her people push the carriage to the front. She rolled up the
curtains and herself called out, âXu Sheng, Ding Feng, are you turned
traitors then?â
The two generals slid out of their saddles, dropped their arms, and stood
meekly in front of the carriage.
âWe are no traitors,â said they. âWe have the Commander-in-Chiefâs
orders to camp here and await Liu Bei.â
âZhou Yu is an interfering scoundrel,â cried she. âWe of the land of the
south have never harmed you, and Liu Bei, the Uncle of the Great Family, is my
husband. I have already told my mother and my brother of our journey, and now I
find you with an army at the foot of these hills preventing our passage. Is it
that you would plunder us of our valuables?â
The two generals mumbled dissent. They would not dare such a thing.
âWe pray you, O Lady, stay your anger. This is no plan of ours. We do but
obey our Generalâs orders.â
âSo you fear Zhou Yu and not me!â cried she scornfully. âThink you that
if he slays you, I will not slay him?â
She broke into a torrent of abuse of Zhou Yu. Then she bade them push her
carriage forward.
The two leaders thought within themselves, âWe are but men of lowly rank. We
dare not dispute with Lady Sun.â
Beside they saw Zhao Zilong was bursting with wrath. So they ordered their
troops to stand aside and leave the road clear.
The cavalcade had only gone a few miles when up came the pursuers. The two
generals told the new-comers what had happened.
âYou were wrong to let them pass,â said Chen Wu and Pan Zhang. âWe have
orders from the Marquis himself to arrest them.â
Thereupon all four went in pursuit.
When the noise of the approaching force reached the ears of Liu Bei, he said to
his wife, âThey are again pursuing us. What now?â
âHusband, go on in front. Zhao Zilong and I will keep them off.â
So Liu Bei and a small company went on toward the river bank, while Zhao Zilong
reined up beside the ladyâs carriage and set out his troops ready for battle.
And when the four generals came up, they dismounted and stood with folded arms.
âWhat are you doing here, Generals?â asked Lady Sun.
âWe have orders from our lord to request you and Liu Bei to return.â
Calmly but bitterly she said, âSo this is the sort of fools you are! You
would make dissension between brother and sister. But I am a wife on my way to
my husbandâs home. Nor am I leaving clandestinely, for I had my motherâs
gracious permission. Now we, husband and wife, are going to Jingzhou. If even
my brother were here himself, he would let us pass in all politeness. But you,
because you have weapons in your hands, would slay us!â
She abused the four men to their faces so that they looked from one to another
in shame. And each in his heart thought, âSay what one will, after all they
two are brother and sister and the Dowager Marchioness is the controlling
power. Sun Quan is most obedient and would never dare oppose his motherâs
decision. When the reaction comes, then indeed we shall certainly be found in
the wrong. We had better be kind.â
Another thing was that one of the two they sought, Liu Bei, was not there and
Zhao Zilong looked angry and dangerous. Finally, muttering to themselves, they
gave way and with one accord retired and left the road open. Lady Sun passed
through.
âWe four will go to see the Commander-in-Chief and report,â said Xu Sheng.
But that did not please them all, and they stood irresolute. Presently they saw
a column of troops sweeping down on them like a hurricane. These were Jiang Qin
and Zhou Tai with their company.
âHave you fellows seen Liu Bei?â they cried as they rushed up.
âHe has just passed along.â
âWhy did you not arrest him?â
âBecause of what Lady Sun said.â
âThat is just as the Marquis feared, and so he gave us this sword and told us
first to slay his sister and then Liu Bei. And if we disobey, he will put us to
death.â
âWhat can be done? They are far away by now.â
Jiang Qin said, âAfter all they are but a few and on foot. They cannot travel
very fast. Let Xu Sheng and Ding Feng go to Zhou Yu to tell him, and he can
send fast boats to pursue them on the river while we follow up on the bank. We
must get them either on water or land, and we must not listen to what they
say.â
Whereupon two went back to report and four to the river bank. Meanwhile Liu Bei
had got a long way from Chaisang and reached Loving Shore. He now felt calmer.
He went along the bank of the river seeking a boat, but there was no craft on
the broad bosom of the stream. He bowed his head in deep sorrow.
Zhao Zilong bade him be of good courage, saying, âMy lord, you have just
escaped from the tigerâs jaws and had not far to go. Moreover, I suspect
Zhuge Liang has something prepared for us.â
But his master was despondent. His thoughts were back to the pleasures he had
enjoyed but a few hours since in the house of his wife, and the tears rolled
down his cheeks. A poem has been written on this episode:
By the bank of the deep flowing Great River
Once was a wedding,
And the ruling houses of two states yet to be
Were allied by marriage.
See the beautiful maiden stepping slowly
To the golden bridal chamber!
Yet was the marriage but a ruse.
Its author vainly imagined that a hero,
Sinking in amorous toils,
Would forget his high intent.
Liu Bei bade Zhao Zilong go along the bank to seek some boats. Then the
soldiers told him there was a huge cloud of dust on the road. Ascending one of
the hills, he looked back whence they had come and saw the whole earth as it
were covered with an advancing host.
He sighed and said, âWe have fled before them now for days, worn out our
soldiers and jaded our horses, and all to die in a strange place.â
He watched the enemy coming nearer and nearer. Then as things began to look
most desperate, he saw a line of some twenty boats all in the act of setting
their sails.
âBy good luck here are some ships,â said Zhao Zilong. âLet us get on
board, row to the further bank, and see what can be done.â
Liu Bei and his bride hastened down the bank and went into a ship. The soldiers
were embarked. Then they saw in the hold of the ship someone in Daoist dress.
That person came up with a smile, saying, âMy lord, again you see Zhuge
Liang. He has waited a long time.â
All the soldiers on board were from Jingzhou, and Liu Bei rejoiced at the
sudden happy turn of affairs.
Before long the four pursuing leaders reached the bank.
Zhuge Liang pointed to them and laughed, saying, âI foresaw this a long time
ago. You may return and tell Zhou Yu not to use the âFair Damsel Trickâ
again.â
Those on the bank sent a flight of arrows at the ships, but they were already
too far away. The four generals on the bank looked very foolish.
As the boats were sailing along, a great noise was heard on the river behind
them, and there appeared a huge fleet of war ships, sailing under the flag of
Zhou Yu. He also was there in command of the fleet, and he was supported by
Huang Gai and Han Dang. They seemed like a drove of horses and came along swift
as a falling star. They gained on the fugitives rapidly.
Zhuge Liang ordered the boats to row over to the north bank, and the party
landed. They had started off away from the shore before Zhou Yu could land.
Zhou Yuâs marines, except the leaders, were all afoot, but they kept up the
pursuit, following as quickly as they could. Zhou Yu led the pursuit, closely
followed by Huang Gai, Han Dang, Xu Sheng, and Ding Feng.
When Zhou Yuâs force reached the borders of Huangzhou, Liu Bei and his party
were not far away, and so they pressed the pursuit. But there were only horses
for a few leaders in front, and suddenly the rolling of drums struck Zhou
Yuâs ears, and from out a gully dashed a troop of swordsmen led by Guan Yu.
Zhou Yu was too surprised and unprepared to do anything but flee.
Zhou Yu fled for his life and Guan Yu pursued. At different points Liu Beiâs
generals, Huang Zhong and Wei Yan, came out and attacked, so that the troops of
the South Land suffered a great defeat, and Zhou Yu barely escaped. As he came
to the river and was going down into his ship, the soldiers of Liu Bei on the
bank jeered at him on account of the miscarriage of his scheme, shouting,
âGeneral Zhou Yu has given Uncle Liu Bei a wife and has lost his soldiers!â
Zhou Yu was so annoyed that he would have gone up the bank to fight again, but
his generals restrained him.
He uttered, âMy schemes are a failure and a defeat, and how can I face my
master again?â
All at once he cried aloud and fell back in a swoon. His wound had reopened.
The generals came to his help, but it was long before he recovered
consciousness.
Twice had he played his trick
And twice had he lost the game;
His heart was full of resentment,
He was overwhelmed with shame.
The fate of Zhou Yu will appear in the next chapter.

**** Chapter 56 ****
The ambuscade into which Zhou Yu had fallen had been prepared by the orders of
Zhuge Liang and was triple. However, Huang Gai and Han Dang contrived to get
clear and found refuge in the ships, though with the loss of many troops. When
Zhou Yu was in safety and looked about him, he saw Liu Bei and Lady Sun safely
resting on a hilltop. How could such a sight fail to put him in a rage? And
with the access of rage, his wound, not yet healed, burst open once again. He
swooned and fell. They raised him and his ship set sail. Zhuge Liang ordered no
pursuit, the southern fleet departed undisturbed, and Liu Bei proceeded to
Jingzhou City, where were great rejoicings in honor of his recent marriage.
Meanwhile Zhou Yu had gone to Chaisang while Jiang Qin and those with him bore
to Nanxu the sad tidings to Sun Quan. He was angry beyond words, and his first
thought was to send an army under Cheng Pu to take Jingzhou. Zhou Yu also wrote
from his sick bed urging his lord to take vengeance. But Zhang Zhao knew better
and said it could not be done.
Said he, âCao Cao has never forgotten his defeat at the Red Cliffs, but he
dares not attempt to avenge himself while the Sun family are friendly with Liu
Bei. If in any moment of anger you two fall upon each other, Cao Cao will
certainly seize the opportunity and your position will be dangerous.â
Gu Yong supported Zhang Zhao, saying, âBeyond all doubt Cao Cao has his spies
here. As soon as he hears of any rift in the friendship between the Sun and Liu
families, he will desire to come to an understanding with the latter, and Liu
Bei, who fears your power, will accept his offer and take his side. Such an
alliance will be a continual menace to the land south of the river. No! The
plan for the occasion is to secure the friendship of Liu Bei by memorializing
that he be made Imperial Protector of Jingzhou. This will make Cao Cao afraid
to send any army against the South Land. At the same time it will raise kindly
feelings in the heart of Liu Bei and win his support. You will be able to find
someone who will provoke a quarrel between Cao Cao and Liu Bei and set them at
each other, and that will be your opportunity. In this way you will succeed.â
âThese are good words,â said Sun Quan, âbut have I a messenger who can
accomplish such a mission?â
âThere is such a man, one whom Cao Cao respects and loves.â
âWho is he?â
âWhat prevents you from employing Hua Xin? He is ready to hand.â
Wherefore Hua Xin was given letters and bidden go to the capital, Xuchang,
whither he proceeded at once and sought to see Cao Cao. They told him that Cao
Cao and all his friends were at Yejun, celebrating the completion of the Bronze
Bird Tower. So thither he went.
Cao Cao had indeed never forgotten his great defeat at the Red Cliffs and
nourished schemes to avenge it, but he feared the combination of his two chief
enemies, and that fear restrained him.
In the spring of the fifteenth year (AD 210) the great Tower was completed, and
Cao Cao invited a vast assembly to celebrate its inauguration with banquets and
rejoicings. The feast was on the bank of River Zhang. The Bronze Bird Terrace
stood in the center, flanked by two others named the Terrace of the Jade Dragon
and the Terrace of the Golden Phoenix. Each tower was a hundred spans high, and
two bridges connected them. Gold and jade vied with each other in the many
apartments.
At the opening ceremony, Cao Cao wore a golden headdress inlaid with jewels and
a robe of green brocaded silk, girded with a belt of jade. On his feet were
pearl-encrusted shoes. So clad he took his seat as host, while his officers,
civil and military, were drawn up below the terrace.
For the military officers was arranged an archery competition, and one of his
attendants brought forth a robe of red crimson Xichuan silk as a prize. This
was suspended from one of the drooping branches of a willow tree, beneath which
was the target. The distance was a hundred paces. The competitors were divided
into two bands, those of Cao Caoâs own family being dressed in red and the
others in green. They all had carved bows and long arrows and were mounted.
They stood holding in their steeds till the signal should be given for the
games to begin. Each was to shoot one arrow, and the robe was the guerdon for
hitting the target in the red; misses were to pay a forfeit of drinking a cup
of cold water.
As soon as the signal was given, a red-robed youth rode quickly forth. He was
Cao Xiu. Swiftly he galloped to and fro thrice. Then he adjusted the notch of
his arrow to the string, pulled the bow to its full, and the arrow flew
straight to the bullâs eye.
The clang of the gongs and the roll of the drums announced the feat, which
astonished them all. And Cao Cao, as he sat on the terrace, was delighted.
âA very promising colt of my own,â said he to those about him, and he sent
a messenger for the red robe that the winner might receive it from his own
hands.
But suddenly from the green side rode out one who cried, âIt were more
fitting to let outsiders compete for the Prime Ministerâs silken robe. It is
not right that members of the family monopolize the contest.â
Cao Cao looked at the speaker, who was Wen Ping. And some of the officers
cried, âLet us see what his shooting is like!â
So Wen Ping fitted an arrow to the string and fired also from horseback while
galloping. To the surprise of the onlookers, he also made a bullâs eye, which
was honored by another salute from gongs and drums.
âQuickly bring me the robe,â cried Wen Ping.
But at once from the ranks of the red-robed another competitor dashed forward,
shouting fiercely, âHow can you win what has been already won? But let me
show you how I can shoot an arrow that shall overcome both your shots.â
He drew his bow to the full, and the arrow flew straight to the heart of the
red. The surprised onlookers saw that this new competitor was Cao Hong, who now
became also a claimant for the robe.
However, yet another archer came forth from the green-robed ranks, playing with
his bow and crying, âWhat is there amazing in your shooting, you three? See
how I can shoot.â
This man was Zhang He. He put his horse to the gallop, then turned his back
and, shooting backwards, also hit the center of the red.
Thus four arrows were now sticking in the bullâs eye, and all agreed that it
was marvelous archery.
âI think the robe should be mine,â said Zhang He.
Before he could finish speaking, a fifth competitor came out from the red robes
and shouted, âYou shot backwards; but that is commonplace enough. Look while
I shoot better than you all.â
The speaker was Xiahou Yuan. He galloped off to the very limit, and then
bending his body over backwards he sent his arrow right in among the other
four.
As the gongs and drums broke out, Xiahou Yuan put aside his bow and rode up,
saying, âIs not that a better shot than any of its predecessors?â
Then came out another from the greens who cried, âLeave the robe there for
me, Xu Huang, to win!â
âWhat can you do that is better than my shot?â said Xiahou Yuan.
âThat you hit the bullâs eye is no great feat. You will see me win the
silken robe after all.â
So speaking, Xu Huang fitted an arrow to his bow. Then looking around, he aimed
at the willow twig from which the robe hung down and shot thereat so true that
his arrow cut it through, and the robe fluttered to the ground. At once Xu
Huang dashed along, picked up the robe and slipped it on. Then riding swiftly
to the terrace, he thanked the Prime Minister. No one present could withhold
unstinted praise, and Xu Huang was turning to ride away.
But another green clad general leaped out, saying, âWhere would you go with
that robe? Quickly leave it for me!â
All eyes turned to this man who was Xu Chu.
Xu Huang cried, âThe robe has already been adjudged to me. Would you dare
take it by forcesâ
Xu Chu made no reply but galloped up to snatch the robe. As Xu Chuâs horse
drew near, Xu Huang struck at his rival a blow with his bow. But Xu Chu seized
the bow with one hand while with the other he simply lifted his opponent out of
his seat. Wherefore Xu Huang let go the bow and the next moment lay sprawling
on the ground. Xu Chu slipped out of the saddle too, and they began to pommel
each other with their fists. Cao Cao sent one to separate them. But in the
struggle, the robe had been torn and soiled. Cao Cao called the angry rivals
before him; and they came, one darting fierce looks of hate, the other grinding
his teeth with rage.
âNever mind the robe. I see only your magnificent courage,â said Cao Cao
smiling. âWhat does a robe more or less matter?â
Whereupon Cao Cao called the generals to him one by one, and to each he
presented a robe of Xichuan silk. They thanked him for the generous gifts, and
he then commanded them to take their seats in due order. Then to the strains of
a band of music, wherein each performer vied with all the others, the naval and
military officers took their places. Civil officers of repute and generals of
renown drank one to another, and hearty felicitations were exchanged.
Cao Cao looked around to those about him, saying, âSince the military
officers have competed in mounted archery for our enjoyment and displayed their
boldness and their skill, you, Gentlemen Scholars, stuffed full of learning as
you are, can surely mount the terrace and present some complimentary odes to
make the occasion a perfect success.â
âWe are most willing to obey your commands,â they replied, all bowing low.
At that time there was a band of four scholars named Wang Lang, Zhong Yao, Wang
Can, and Chen Lin, and each of them presented a poem. Every poem sang the
praises of Cao Caoâs valuable services and great merits and said he was
worthy to receive the highest trust of all.
When Cao Cao had read them, he laughed, saying, âYou gentlemen are really too
flattering. As a fact I am but an ignoramus who began life with a simple
bachelorâs degree and recommendations for filial devotion. And when the
troubles began, I built for myself a little cottage in the country near Qiao,
where I could study in spring and summer and spend the rest of the year in
hunting till the empire was once more tranquil and I could emerge and take
office.
âTo my surprise, I was chosen for a small military office which changed my
intentions, and I determined to repress the rebellion and so make a name for
myself. I thought that I might win an inscription on my tomb to the effect that
it covered the remains of the âLord Cao Cao Who Restores Order in the
West.â That would have been ample for a lifeâs work. I recall now how I
destroyed Dong Zhuo and smote the Yellow Scarves; then I made away with Yuan
Shu and broke the power of Lu Bu; next I exterminated Yuan Shao; and at the
death of Liu Biao, I had subdued the whole empire.
âAs a minister of state I have attained the topmost pinnacle of honor, and I
have no more to hope for. Were it not for poor me, I know not how many there
would be styling themselves emperors and dubbing themselves princes. Certain
there be who, seeing my great authority, think I have some ulterior aim. But
they are quite wrong. I ever bear in mind what Confucius said of King Wen of
Zhou, that he was perfectly virtuous, and this saying is ever engraved on my
mind. If I could, I would do away with my armies and retire to my fief with my
simple title of Lord of Wuping. Alas! I cannot. I am afraid to lay down my
military powers lest I should come to harm. Should I be defeated, the state
would totter; and so I may not risk real misfortune for the sake of an empty
reputation for kindness. There be some of you who do not know my heart.â
As he closed, they all rose and bowed their heads, saying, âNone are your
equals, O Prime Minister, not even Duke of Zhou or the great Minister Yi
Yin.â
A poem has been written referring to this:
Had Duke Zhou, the virtuous, died, while foul-mouthed slander
was spreading vile rumors;
Or Wang Mang, the treacherous, while he was noted for the
deference paid to learned men;
None would have known their real characters.
After this oration Cao Cao drank many cups of wine in quick succession till he
became very intoxicated. He bade his servants bring him brush and inkstone so
that he might compose a poem.
But as he was beginning to write, they announced, âThe Marquis of Wu has sent
Hua Xin as an envoy and presented a memorial to appoint Liu Bei Imperial
Protector of Jingzhou. Sun Quanâs sister is now Liu Beiâs wife, while on
the River Han, the greater part of the nine territories is under Liu Beiâs
rule.â
Cao Cao was seized with quaking fear at the news and threw the pen on the
floor.
Cheng Yu said to him, âO Prime Minister, you have been among fighting
soldiers by myriads and in danger from stones and arrows many a time and never
quailed. Now the news that Liu Bei has got possession of a small tract of
country throws you into a panic. Why is it thus?â
Cao Cao replied, âLiu Bei is a dragon among humans. All his life hitherto he
has never found his element, but now that he has obtained Jingzhou: It is as if
the dragon, once captive, had escaped to the mighty deep. There is good reason
for me to quake with fear.â
âDo you know the reason of the coming of Hua Xin?â said Cheng Yu.
âNo, I know not,â said the Prime Minister.
âLiu Bei is Sun Quanâs one terror, and Sun Quan would attack Liu Bei were
it not for you, O Prime Minister. Sun Quan feels you would fall upon him while
he was smiting his enemy. Wherefore he has taken this means of calming Liu
Beiâs suspicions and fears and at the same time directing your enmity toward
Liu Bei and from himself.â
Cao Cao nodded. âYes,â he said.
Cheng Yu continued, âNow this is my plan to set Sun Quan and Liu Bei at one
another and give you the opportunity to destroy both. It can be done easily.â
âWhat is your plan?â asked Cao Cao.
âThe one prop of the South Land is Zhou Yu. Remove it by memorializing that
Zhou Yu be appointed Governor of Nanjun. Then get Cheng Pu made Governor of
Jiangxia, and cause the Emperor to retain this Hua Xin in the capital to await
some important post. Zhou Yu will assuredly attack Liu Bei, and that will be
our chance. Is not the scheme good?â
âFriend Cheng Yu, you are a man after my own heart.â
Wherefore Cao Cao summoned the emissary from the South Land and overwhelmed him
with gifts. That day was the last of the feastings and merry-makings; and Cao
Cao, with all the company, returned to the capital where he forthwith presented
a memorial assigning Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu to the governorships of Nanjun and
Jiangxia, and Hua Xin was retained at the capital with a post of ministry.
The messenger bearing the commissions for their new offices went down to the
South Land, and both Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu accepted the appointments. Having
taken over his command, the former thought all the more of the revenge he
contemplated and, to bring matters to a head, he wrote to Sun Quan asking him
to send Lu Su and renew the demand for the rendition of Jingzhou.
Wherefore Lu Su was summoned, and his master said to him, âYou are the
guarantor in the loan of Jingzhou to Liu Bei. He still delays to return it, and
how long am I to wait?â
âThe writing said plainly that the rendition would follow the occupation of
Yizhou.â
Sun Quan shouted back, âYes, it said so! But so far they have not moved a
soldier to the attack. I will not wait till old age has come to us all.â
âI will go and inquire?â said Lu Su.
So he went down into a ship and sailed to Jingzhou.
Meanwhile Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang were at Jingzhou gathering in supplies from
all sides, drilling their troops, and training their armies. From all quarters
people of learning flocked to their side. In the midst of this they heard of Lu
Suâs coming, and Liu Bei asked Zhuge Liang what he thought.
Zhuge Liang replied, âJust lately Sun Quan concerned himself with getting you
appointed Imperial Protector of Jingzhou: That was calculated to inspire Cao
Cao with fear. Cao Cao obtained for Zhou Yu the governorship of Nanjun: That
was designed to stir up strife between our two houses and set us fighting so
that he might accomplish his own ends. This visit of Lu Su means that Zhou Yu,
having taken over his new governorship, wishes to force us out of this
place.â
âThen how shall we reply?â
âIf Lu Su introduces the subject, you will at once set up loud lamentations.
When the sound of lamentation is at its height, I will appear and talk over
your visitor.â
Thus they planned, and Lu Su was duly received with all honor.
When the salutations were over and host and guest were about to be seated, Lu
Su said, âSir, now that you are the husband of a daughter of Wu, you have
become my lord, and I dare not sit in your presence.â
Liu Bei laughed. âYou are an old friend,â said he. âWhy this excessive
humility?â
So Lu Su took his seat. And when tea had been served, the guest said, âI have
come at the order of my master to discuss the subject of Jingzhou. You, O
Imperial Uncle, have had the use of the place for a long time. Now that your
two houses are allied by marriage, there should be the most friendly relations
between you two, and you should hand it back to my master.â
At this Liu Bei covered his face and began to cry.
âWhat is the matter?â asked the guest.
Liu Bei only wept the more bitterly.
Then Zhuge Liang came in from behind a screen, saying, âI have been
listening. Do you know why my lord weeps so bitterly?â
âReally I know not.â
âBut it is easy to see. When my lord got the temporary occupation of
Jingzhou, he gave the promise to return it when he had got the West River Land.
But reflect. Liu Zhang of Yizhou is my lordâs younger brother, and both of
them are blood relations of the ruling family. If my lord were to move an army
to capture another region, he fears the blame of the ignorant. And if he yields
this place before he has another, where could he rest? Yet while he retains
this place, it seems to shame you. The thing is hard on both sides, and that is
why he weeps so bitterly.â
The close of Zhuge Liangâs speech seemed to move Liu Bei to greater grief,
for he beat his breast and stamped his feet and wept yet more bitterly.
Lu Su attempted to console him, saying, âBe not so distressed, O Uncle. Let
us hear what Zhuge Liang can propose.â
Zhuge Liang said, âI would beg you to return to your master and tell him all.
Tell him of this great trouble, and entreat him to let us stay here a little
longer.â
âBut suppose he refuses: What then?â said Lu Su.
âHow can he refuse since he is related by marriage to my master?â said
Zhuge Liang. âI shall expect to hear glad tidings through you.â
Lu Su was really the first of generous people. Seeing Liu Bei in such distress,
he could do no other than consent and say he would do so. Liu Bei and Zhuge
Liang both thanked him most cordially, and after a banquet the emissary went
down into his ship to return.
On the way Lu Su called in to see Zhou Yu at Chaisang and told him.
But Zhou Yu stamped his foot with rage and said, âMy friend, you have been
fooled again. Long ago when Liu Bei was dependent on Liu Biao, he always
cherished the intention to supplant him. Think you that he really pities Liu
Zhang? This sort of evasive policy will certainly cause you much trouble.
However, I have a scheme which I think Zhuge Liang will not be able to get the
better of. Only you will have to make another journey.â
âI should be pleased to hear your fine scheme,â said Lu Su.
âDo not go to see our master. Return to Jingzhou and say to Liu Bei that
since his family and the Suns are related by marriage, they really form but one
house, and since he has qualms about attacking the west, we will do it for him.
Thus, the South Land will march an army under this pretext, but really go to
Jingzhou, and we shall take him unprepared. The road to the west runs through
his city, and we will call upon him for supplies. He will come out to thank the
army, and we will assassinate him whereby we shall revenge ourselves and at the
same time remove a source of future evil.â
This seemed an excellent plan to Lu Su, and he returned at once to Jingzhou.
Before receiving him, Liu Bei talked over the matter with his adviser.
Said Zhuge Liang, âLu Su has not seen the Marquis of Wu. He has called in at
Chaisang, and he and Zhou Yu have decided upon some scheme, which he is to talk
you into accepting. However, let him talk. You, my lord, only watch me; and
when I nod my head, then you agree to whatever he may propose.â
Lu Su was then admitted and said, âThe Marquis of Wu praises the noble virtue
of the Imperial Uncle; and after consultation with his officers, he has
determined to take the western country on the Imperial Uncleâs behalf and,
that done, Jingzhou can be exchanged for it without further delay. However,
when the army marches through, it will be expected of you to contribute some
necessary supplies.â
Zhuge Liang here nodded his head rapidly, at the same time saying, âWe could
hardly have hoped for such kindness.â
And Liu Bei saluted with joined hands and said, âThis is due to your friendly
efforts on our behalf.â
âWhen the brave army arrives, we shall certainly come out to meet it and
entertain the soldiers,â said Zhuge Liang.
Lu Su felt great satisfaction and was quite happy at his success. He took his
leave and went homeward. But Liu Bei as yet did not understand.
âWhat is their intention?â said he.
His adviser smiled, saying, âZhou Yuâs end is very near. The ruse he is now
trying would not take in a child.â
âWhy?â
âThis is the ruse known as âBorrow a Road to Destroy the Hostâ. Under the
pretense of taking the west, they intend to capture this place; and when you go
out to compliment the army, you will be seized and they will dash into the city
which they hope to find unprepared.â
âAnd what are we to do?â
âHave no anxiety, my lord. All we have to do is to prepare a hidden bow to
get the fierce tiger; to spread the enticing bait to hook the great leviathan.
Wait till Zhou Yu comes. If he is not killed, he will be nine-tenths a corpse.
We will call in Zhao Zilong for orders and give him secret instructions, and I
will dispose the others.â
And Liu Bei was glad.
Let Zhou Yu lay what plans he will,
Zhuge Liang anticipates his skill;
That land of rivers fair bait did look,
But he forgot the hidden hook.
Lu Su hastened back to Zhou Yu to tell him that all was going as he desired and
Liu Bei would come out to welcome the army.
Zhou Yu laughed with glee, saying, âAt last! Now they will fall into my
trap.â
Zhou Yu bade Lu Su prepare a petition for the information of the Marquis, and
he ordered Cheng Pu to bring up reinforcements. He himself had nearly recovered
from the arrow wound and felt well. He made his dispositions for the advance,
appointing Gan Ning Van Leader, Xu Sheng and Ding Feng the Commanders of the
body, and Ling Tong and Lu Meng Rear Guards. The army numbered fifty thousand
troops, and Zhou Yu marched with the second division. While voyaging in his
ship, he was always smiling to think how he was to have Zhuge Liang at last.
At Xiakou he inquired, âIs there anyone to welcome the brave army?â
They told him, âThe Imperial Uncle has sent Mi Zhu to greet us.â
And Mi Zhu was called.
âWhat of the preparations for the army?â asked Zhou Yu as soon as Mi Zhu
came.
âMy master has seen to that. All is prepared,â said Mi Zhu.
âWhere is the Imperial Uncle?â asked Zhou Yu.
âHe is at the city of Jingzhou, waiting outside the walls to offer you the
cup of greeting.â
âThis expedition is on your account,â said Zhou Yu. âWhen one undertakes
so long a march and such a task, the rewards for the army must be very
substantial.â
Having got this idea of what Zhou Yu expected, Mi Zhu returned to his own city,
while the southern battle ships in close order sailed up the river and took
their places along the bank. As they went on, the most perfect tranquillity
seemed to reign on all sides. Not a ship was visible anywhere, and no one
hindered. Zhou Yu pressed forward till he came quite near Jingzhou, and still
the wide river lay calm. But the spies who came back reported two white flags
flying on the city walls.
Still not a person was seen, and Zhou Yu began to feel suspicious. He had his
ship navigated in shore, and he himself landed on the bank, where he mounted a
horse and, with a small army of three thousand veterans under Gan Ning, Xu
Sheng, and Ding Feng, traveled along the land road.
By and bye he came to the city wall. There was no sign of life. Reining in his
steed, he bade them challenge the gate.
Then someone from the wall asked, âWho is there?â
The soldiers of the South Land replied, âThe Commander-in-Chief of the South
Land, Zhou Yu, in person.â
Immediately was heard the thud of a club, and the wall became alive with troops
all armed. And from the tower came out Zhao Zilong who said, âWhy are you
here, General?â
âI am going to take the west for you,â replied Zhou Yu. âDo you not
know?â
âThe Directing Instructor knows that you want to try the ruse of âBorrow a
Road to Destroy the Hostâ. And so he stationed me here. And my master bade me
say that he and the ruler of the West River Land are both members of the
reigning family so that he could not think of such baseness as attacking
Yizhou. If you people of the South Land do so, he will be forced to go away
into the mountains and become a recluse. He could not bear to lose the
confidence of humankind.â
At this Zhou Yu turned his horse as if to return. Just then his scouts came up
to report: âArmed bands are moving toward us from all four sides, led by Guan
Yu, Zhang Fei, Huang Zhong, and Wei Yan. Their number is unknown, but the sound
of their tramping shakes the heavens. They say they want to capture the
Commander-in-Chief.â
At these tidings Zhou Yuâs excitement became so intense that he fell to the
ground with a great cry, and the old wound reopened.
The game was now too deep; in vain he sought
A countermove; his efforts came to nought.
Later chapters will show what was Zhou Yuâs fate.

and he fell to the ground. Then he was carried to his boat. It only added to
his rage and mortification to be told that Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang could be
seen on the top of one of the hills apparently feasting and enjoying some
music. He lay grinding his teeth with vexation.
âThey say I shall never be able to get Yizhou! But I will â-I swear I
will.â
Soon after Sun Quanâs brother Sun Hu arrived, and Zhou Yu told him his
vexations.
âMy brother sent me to assist you,â said Sun Hu.
Zhou Yu ordered Sun Hu to press the army forward for Yizhou, and they got to
Baqiu. There they stopped, for the scouts reported large forces under Liu
Beiâs generals â-Liu Feng and Guan Ping â-barring the water route in the
Great River. This failure did not make the Commander-in-Chief any calmer.
About this time a letter from Zhuge Liang arrived, which ran like this:
âSince our parting at Chaisang I have thought of you often. Now comes to me a
report that you desire to take the West River Land, which I regret to say I
consider impossible. The people there are strong, and the country is
precipitous and defensible. Imperial Protector Liu Zhang may be weak within,
but he is strong enough to defend himself.
âNow indeed, General, you would go far and you would render great services,
yet can anyone foretell the final result? No! Not even Wu Qi the Great General
could say for certain, nor could Sun Zi the Famed Strategist be sure of a
successful issue. Cao Cao suffered severe defeat at the Red Cliffs. Think you
he will ever cease to hope for revenge? Now if you undertake a long expedition,
will he not seize the occasion to fall upon the South Land and grind it to
powder? Such a deed would be more than I could bear, and I venture to warn you
of the possible danger if haply you may condescend to regard it.â
The letter made Zhou Yu feel very sorrowful, and he sighed deeply. He called
for paper and ink and wrote to the Marquis of Wu.
Having done this, he said to his assembled officers, âI have honestly tried
to do my best for our house, but my end is at hand. The number of my days is
accomplished. You must continue to aid our master till his end shall be
achieved ââ-â
He stopped, for he had swooned.
Slowly he regained consciousness; and as he looked up to heaven, he sighed
heavily, âO God, since you made Zhou Yu, why did you also create Zhuge
Liang?â
Soon after he passed away. He was only thirty-six.
The battle at the Red Cliffs made him famous;
Though young in years he gained a veteranâs reputation.
Deep feeling, his music declared its intensity;
Subtle, with excess hospitality he foiled a plot;
Persuasive, he obtained a large gift of grain from Lu Su;
Capable, he led an army of millions.
Baqiu was his deathbed, there his fate met him.
Sadly indeed they mourned him.
After his death his generals sent his dying memorial to the Marquis of Wu, who
was most deeply affected and wept aloud at the sad tidings of his death. When
Sun Quan opened the letters, he saw that Lu Su was named as the dead
generalâs successor, This is the letter:
âPossessing but ordinary abilities, there was no reason why I should have
been the recipient of your confidence and high office, but I have not spared
myself in the leadership of the great army under my command that thereby I
might prove my gratitude. Yet none can measure life, and the number of our days
is ordained by fate. Before I could achieve even my poor intentions, my feeble
body has failed me. I regret it without measure. I die with Cao Cao threatening
and our northern borders disturbed, and with Liu Bei in your family as though
you were feeding a fierce tiger. None can foretell the fate of the empire in
these nervous days of stress and of peculiar anxiety for you.
âLu Su is most loyal, careful in all matters and a fitting man to succeed to
my office. When a person is near death, his words are wise. If I may haply
retain your regard, I may die but I shall not decay.â
âZhou Yu should have been a kingâs counselor!â cried Sun Quan, amid his
tears. âHe has left me alas! too soon, and whom have I to lean upon? But he
recommends Lu Su, and I can do nothing better than take that advice.â
Whereupon Sun Quan appointed Lu Su to the vacant command, Commander-in-Chief.
Sun Quan also saw that the coffin of his beloved general was sent to Chaisang
ready for the funeral sacrifices.
The night of Zhou Yuâs death, Zhuge Liang was gazing up at the heavens when
he saw a star of a general fall to the earth.
âZhou Yu is dead,â said he with a smile.
At dawn he sent to tell Liu Bei, who sent people to find out, and they came
back to say it was true that Zhou Yu had died.
âNow that this has come to pass, what should we do?â said Liu Bei.
âLu Su will succeed,â said Zhuge Liang. âAnd I see in the heavens signs
of an assembly of generals in the southeast, so I shall go there. The mourning
for Zhou Yu will serve as a pretext. I may find some able leaders there to be
of help to you.â
âI am afraid lest the generals of the South Land harm you,â said Liu Bei.
âWhile Zhou Yu lived, I did not fear. Is there anything to dread now that he
is gone?â
However, Zhuge Liang took Zhao Zilong as commander of his escort when he
embarked for Baqiu, and on the road he heard of Lu Suâs succession to the
late generalâs post. As the coffin of Zhou Yu had been sent to Chaisang,
Zhuge Liang continued his journey thither and, on landing, was kindly received
by Lu Su. The officers of the South Land did not conceal their enmity, but the
sight of the redoubtable Zhao Zilong, always close at hand, kept them from
trying to hurt Zhuge Liang.
The officers brought by Zhuge Liang were arranged in order before the bier, and
he himself poured the libation. Then he knelt and read this threnody:
âAlas, Zhou Yu! Hapless are you in your early death. Length of days is in the
hands of God, yet do humans suffer and my heart is deeply grieved for you. I
pour this libation that your spirit may enjoy its fragrance.
âI lament you. I lament your younger days passed in the companionship of Sun
Ce, when, preferring eternal principles to material wealth, you abode in a
humble cottage.
âI lament your ripe strength when you guarded distant Baqiu, putting fear
into the heart of Liu Biao, destroying rebels, and ensuring safety.
âI lament the grace of your manhood. Married to a fair maid of the Qiao
family, son-in-law of a great minister, you were such as would add luster to
the Han Court.
âI lament your resolute purpose when you opposed the pledge-giving to Cao
Cao. As in the beginning your wings drooped not, so in the end your pinions
spread wide.
âI lament your abandon, when your false friend, Jiang Gan, came to you at
Poyang Lake. There you manifested your lofty ideals.
âI lament your magnificent talents, proved in civil administration as in
military science. With fire attacking the fierce enemy at the Red Cliffs, you
brought his strength to weakness.
âI recall you as you were but yesterday, bold and successful, and I weep your
untimely death. Prostrate I weep tears of sorrow. Loyal and upright in heart,
noble and spiritual by nature, your life has been but three decades, but your
fame will endure for ages.
âI mourn for your affection. My bowels writhe with sorrow, and my deep-seated
sadness will never cease. The very heavens are darkened; the army is sad; your
lord sheds tears; your friends weep floods.
âScanty of ability am I, yet even of me you begged plans and sought schemes
to aid the South Land to repulse Cao Cao, to restore the Hans and comfort the
Lius. But with you as the firm corner stone and your perfect dispositions,
could the final result cause any anxiety?
âAlas, my friend! The quick and the dead are ever separate; they mingle
never. If in the deep shades spirits have understanding, you now read my inmost
heart, yet hereafter there will be none on earth to comprehend.
âAlas, the pain!
âDeign to accept this my sacrifice.â
The sacrifice finished, Zhuge Liang bowed to the ground and keened while his
tears gushed forth in floods. He was deeply moved.
Those who stood on guard by the bier said one to another, âPeople lied when
they said these two were enemies. Look at the sincerity shown in sacrifice.â
And Lu Su was particularly affected by the display of feeling and thought,
âPlainly Zhuge Liang loved Zhou Yu much, but Zhou Yu was not broadminded
enough and would have done Zhuge Liang to death.â
Before Sleeping Dragon emerged from his Nanyang retreat,
A brilliant man had descended upon this earth;
Since, O Azure Heaven, ye made Zhou Yu,
Why needed Yellow Earth produce a Zhuge Liang?
Lu Su gave a banquet for Zhuge Liang after which the guest left.
Just as Zhuge Liang was embarking, his arm was clutched by a person in Daoist
dress who said with a smile, âYou exasperated literally to death the man
whose body lies up there. To come here as a mourner is an open insult to the
South Land. It is as good as to say they have no other left.â
Zhuge Liang turned to look, and he saw it was no other than Pang Tong, or the
Young Phoenix. Then Zhuge Liang laughed in his turn, and they two hand in hand
went down into the ship, where they talked heart to heart for a long time.
Before leaving, Zhuge Liang gave his friend a letter and said, âI do not
think that Sun Quan will use you as you merit. If you find life here
distasteful, then you may come to Jingzhou and help to support my master. He is
liberal and virtuous and will not disdain what you have spent your life in
learning.â
Then they parted, and Zhuge Liang went alone to Jingzhou.
Lu Su had the coffin of Zhou Yu taken to Wuhu, where Sun Quan received it with
sacrifices and lamentations. The dead leader was buried in his native place.
Zhou Yuâs family consisted of two sons and a daughter, the children being
named Zhou Xun, Zhou Yin, and Zhou Ying. Sun Quan treated them with generosity
and tenderness.
Lu Su was not satisfied that he was the fittest successor to his late chief and
said, âZhou Yu was not right in recommending me, for I have not the requisite
ability and am unfitted for this post. But I can commend to you a certain able
man, conversant with all knowledge, and a most capable strategist, not inferior
to the old Guan Zhong or Yue Yi, one whose plans are as good as those of Sun Zi
and Wu Qi, the most famous masters of the Art of War. Zhou Yu often took his
advice, and Zhuge Liang believes in him. And he is at hand.â
This was good news for Sun Quan, who asked the manâs name, and when he heard
it was Pang Tong or Young Phoenix, he replied, âYes. I know him by
reputation. Let him come.â
Whereupon Pang Tong was invited to the palace and introduced. The formal
salutations over, Sun Quan was disappointed with the manâs appearance, which
was indeed extraordinary. Pang Tong had bushy eyebrows, a turned-up nose, and a
stubby beard. So Sun Quan was prejudiced against Pang Tong.
âWhat have you studied,â asked Sun Quan, âand what are you master of?â
Pang Tong replied, âOne must not be narrow and obstinate; one must change
with circumstances.â
âHow does your learning compare with that of Zhou Yu?â asked Sun Quan.
âMy learning is not to be compared with his in the least. Mine is far
greater.â
Now Sun Quan had always loved his late general, and he could not bear to hear
him disparaged. This speech of Pang Tong only increased his dislike.
So Sun Quan said, âYou may retire, Sir. I will send for you when I can employ
you.â
Pang Tong uttered one long sigh and went away.
When he had gone, Lu Su said, âMy lord, why not employ him?â
âWhat good would result? He is just one of those mad fellows.â
âHe did good service at the Red Cliffs fight, however, for it was he who got
Cao Cao to chain his ships together.â
âIt was simply that Cao Cao wished to chain his ships together. No credit was
due to this fellow. In any case I give you my word that I will not employ him.
That much is certain.â
Lu Su went out and explained to Pang Tong that the failure was not due to lack
of recommendation, but simply a whim of Sun Quan, and he must put up with it.
The disappointed suitor hung his head and sighed many times without speaking.
âI fear you are doomed to constant disappointment here,â said Lu Su.
âThere is nothing you can hope for, eh?â
But still Pang Tong was silent.
âWith your wonderful gifts, of course you will be successful whithersoever
you may go. You may take my word for that. But to whom will you go?â
âI think I will join Cao Cao,â said Pang Tong suddenly.
âThat would be hinging a gleaming pearl into darkness. Rather go to Liu Bei,
who would appreciate you and employ you fittingly.â
âThe truth is that I have been thinking of this for a long time,â said Pang
Tong. âI was only joking just now.â
âI will give you a letter to Liu Bei. And if you go to him, you must try to
maintain peace between him and my lord and get them to act together against Cao
Cao.â
âThat has been the one desire of my life.â
Pang Tong took the letter offered by Lu Su and soon made his way to Jingzhou
City. He arrived at a moment that Zhuge Liang was absent on an inspection
journey, but the doorkeeper announced him and said he had come to throw in his
lot with Liu Bei. He was received, for he was no stranger in name.
When Pang Tong was admitted, he made the ordinary salutation but did not make
an obeisance and this, coupled with his ugly face, did not please his host.
âYou have come a long and arduous journey,â said Liu Bei.
At this point the suitor should have produced his letters from Zhuge Liang and
Lu Su, but did not.
Instead he replied, âI hear, O Imperial Uncle, that you are welcoming the
wise and receiving scholars, wherefore I have come to join your service.â
âThe country is decently peaceful now, and unfortunately there is no office
vacant. But away to the northeast there is a small magistracy, Leiyang, which
needs a chief. I can offer you that post until there should be something more
fitting.â
Pang Tong thought this rather poor welcome for a person of his talent. But his
friend was absent, so he could do nothing but control his annoyance and accept.
He took his leave and started.
But when he arrived at his post, he paid no attention to business at all. He
gave himself up entirely to dissipation. The taxes were not collected nor were
lawsuits decided.
News of this reaching Liu Bei, who was angry and said, âHere is this stiff-
necked pedant throwing my administration into disorder.â
So Liu Bei sent Zhang Fei to the county with orders to make a general
inspection of the whole county and look into any irregularities and disorders.
But as Liu Bei thought there might be some tact needed, Sun Qian was also sent
as coadjutor.
In due course the inquisitors arrived at Leiyang, where they were received by
the officials and welcomed by the people at the boundary. But the Magistrate
did not appear.
âWhere is the Magistrate?â asked Zhang Fei.
âEver since his arrival, a hundred days ago and more, he has attended to no
business, but spends his days from morn to night in wine-bobbing and is always
intoxicated. Just now he is sleeping off a debauch and is not yet risen.â
This raised Zhang Feiâs choler, and he would have dismissed the offender
forthwith had not his colleague said, âPang Tong is a man of great ability,
and it would be wrong to deal with him thus summarily. Let us inquire into it.
If he is really so guilty, we will punish his offense.â
So they went to the magistracy, took their seats in the Hall of Justice, and
summoned the Magistrate before them. He came with dress all disordered and
still under the influence of wine.
âMy brother took you for a decent person,â said Zhang Fei, angrily, âand
sent you here as magistrate. How dare you throw the affairs of the county into
disorder?â
âDo you think I have done as you say, General?â said Pang Tong. âWhat
affairs have I disordered?â
âYou have been here over a hundred days and spent the whole time in
dissipation. Is not that disorderly?â
âWhere would be the difficulty in dealing with the business of a trifling
county like this? I pray you, General, sit down for a while till I have settled
the cases.â
Thereupon Pang Tong bade the clerks bring in all the arrears and he would
settle them at once. So they brought in the piles of papers and ordered the
suitors to appear. They came and knelt in the hall while the magistrate, brush
in hand, noted this and minuted that, all the while listening to the pleadings.
Soon all the difficulties and disputes were adjusted, and never a mistake was
made, as the satisfied bows of the people proved. By midday the whole of the
cases were disposed of, and the arrears of the hundred days settled and
decided.
This done, the Magistrate threw aside his pen and turned to the inquisitors,
saying, âWhere is the disorder? When I can take on Cao Cao and Sun Quan as
easily as I can read this paper, what attention from me is needed for the
business of this paltry place?â
Zhang Fei was astonished at the manâs ability, rose from his seat, and
crossed over, saying, âYou are indeed a marvel, Master. I have not treated
you respectfully enough, but now I shall commend you to my brother with all my
might.â
Then Pang Tong drew forth Lu Suâs letter and showed it to Zhang Fei.
âWhy did you not show this to my brother when you first saw him?â asked
Zhang Fei.
âIf I had had a chance, I would have done so. But is it likely that one would
just take advantage of a letter of commendation to make a visit?â
Zhang Fei turned to his colleague and said, âYou just saved a wise man for
us.â
Sun Qian and Zhang Fei left the magistracy and returned to Liu Bei to whom they
related what had happened.
Liu Bei then seemed to be conscious of his error and said, âI have been
wrong. I have behaved unjustly to a learned person.â
Zhang Fei then gave his brother the letter in which Lu Su had recommended Pang
Tong. Opening it he read:
âPang Tong is not the sort of person to be met with in any dayâs march.
Employ him in some capacity where extra ordinary talent is required, and his
powers will declare themselves. Beware of judging him by his looks, or you may
lose the advantage of his abilities, and some other will gain him. This would
be a misfortune.â
While Liu Bei was feeling cast down at the mistake he had made, as shown by the
letter, they announced the return of Zhuge Liang.
Soon Zhuge Liang entered the hall, and the first question he put after the
formal salutations was: âIs Directing-Instructor Pang Tong quite well?â
âHe is in charge of Leiyang,â replied Liu Bei, âwhere he is given to wine
and neglects his business.â
Zhuge Liang laughed, saying, âMy friend Pang Tong has extraordinary abilities
and ten times my knowledge. I gave him a letter for you, my lord. Did he
present it?â
âThis very day I have received a letter, but from Lu Su. I have had no letter
written by you.â
âWhen a person of transcendent abilities is sent to a paltry post, he always
turns to wine out of simple ennui,â said Zhuge Liang.
âIf it had not been for what my brother said, I should have lost a great
scholar,â said Liu Bei.
Then he lost no time, but sent Zhang Fei off to the northeast to request Pang
Tong to come to Jingzhou City. When he arrived, Liu Bei went out to meet him
and at the foot of the steps asked pardon for his mistake. Then Pang Tong
produced the letter that Zhuge Liang had given him. What Liu Bei read therein
was this:
âAs soon as the Young Phoenix shall arrive, he should be given an important
post.â
Liu Bei rejoiced indeed as he read it, and he said, âWater Mirror said of the
two men, Sleeping Dragon and Young Phoenix, that any man who obtained the help
of either of them could restore the empire when he would. As I now have them
both, surely the Hans will rise again.â
Then he appointed Pang Tong as Vice Directing Instructor and General, and the
two strategists began training the army for its work of subjugation.
News of these doings came to the capital, Xuchang, and Cao Cao was told of Liu
Beiâs two strategists and of the army in training and the stores accumulating
and the league between his two chief enemies. And he knew that he had to expect
an attack sooner or later. So he summoned his strategists to a council for a
new campaign.
Said Xun Yu, âSun Quan should be first attacked, because of the recent death
of their ablest general Zhou Yu. Liu Bei will follow.â
Cao Cao replied, âIf I go on such a distant expedition, Ma Teng will fall
upon the capital. While I was at the Red Cliffs, there were sinister rumors of
this, and I must guard against it.â
Xun Yu said, âThe best thing that occurs to me is to obtain for Ma Teng the
title of General Who Subdues the South and send him against the South Land.
Thus he can be enticed to the capital and got rid of. Then you can have no fear
of marching southward.â
Cao Cao approved, and soon Ma Teng was summoned from Xiliang, a frontier
territory in the west.
Ma Teng was a descendant of the famous leader Ma Yuan, General Who Quells the
Waves. His fatherâs name was Ma Sui. Ma Sui had held a minor magistracy in
Tianshui in the reign of Emperor Huan, but had lost it and drifted west into
the West Valley Land where he got amongst the Qiang Peoples, one of whose women
he took to wife. She bore him a son, Ma Teng. Ma Teng was rather over the
common height, and bold-looking. He was of a mild disposition and very popular.
But in the reign of Emperor Ling, these Qiangs made trouble, and then Ma Teng
raised a force and put it down. For his services he received the tile of
General Who Corrects the West. He and Han Sui, who was known as Commander Who
Guards the West, were pledged brothers.
On receipt of the summons to the capital, Ma Teng took his eldest son, Ma Chao,
into his confidence and told him some of his former life.
âWhen Dong Cheng got the Girdle Edict from the Emperor, we formed a society,
of which Liu Bei was one, pledged to put down rebellion. However, we
accomplished nothing, for Dong Cheng was put to death and Liu Bei was
unfortunate, while I escaped to the west. However, I hear that Liu Bei now
holds Jingzhou, and I am inclined to carry out the plan we made so long ago.
But here I am summoned by Cao Cao and what is to be done?â
Ma Chao replied, âCao Cao has the command of the Emperor to call you. If you
do not go, that will mean disobeying an imperial command and you will be
punished. Obey the summons in so far as to go to the capital, where you may be
able to arrange to carry out your original intention.â
But Ma Tengâs nephew, Ma Dai, held other opinions and opposed this.
Said he, âCao Caoâs designs are unfathomable. If you go, Uncle, I fear you
will suffer.â
âLet me lead the army against the capital,â said Ma Chao. âCan we not
purge the empire of evil?â
But his father said, âYou must take command of the Qiang troops for the
defense of our territory here. I will take with me your two brothers and your
cousin. When Cao Cao knows that you have the Qiangs at your call and that Han
Sui is prepared to assist, he will hardly dare to work any harm to me.â
âFather, if you must go, be careful not to enter the city till you know
exactly what plots and machinations are afoot.â
âI will certainly take great care, so do not be too anxious,â said the
father.
The order of march was prepared. The Governor took five thousand troops, with
his two sons â-Ma Xiu and Ma Tie â-as Leaders of the Van and his nephew Ma
Dai bringing up the rear. These set out along the tortuous road to the capital.
At seven miles distance from Xuchang they camped.
When Cao Cao heard of Ma Tengâs arrival, he called to him Minister Huang Kui
and said to him, âMa Teng is to be sent against the south, and I shall send
you as Adviser. You are first to go to his camp and express my congratulations
on his arrival and say that as Xiliang is so distant and transport very
difficult, he is not to take too large an army of his own. I will send a large
force. Also tell him to come in soon for audience of the Emperor. I will send
him supplies.â
With these instructions Huang Kui went to Ma Teng, who brought out wine and
entertained him well.
In his cups the messenger grew confidential and said, âMy father perished at
the hands of Li Jue and Guo Si, and I have always nourished resentment. Now
there is another rebel in power wronging our Prince.â
âWho is that?â asked Ma Teng.
âThe wrong doer is that rebel Cao Cao, of course. Do you mean to say you do
not know?â
However, Ma Teng was careful. He thought it very likely that these words were
but a trap for him, so he pretended to be greatly shocked and begged his guest
to be careful lest he be overheard.
But Huang Kui cared not, shouting, âThen you have quite forgotten the Girdle
Edict, eh?â
Ma Teng began to see Huang Kui was sincere and presently became confidential in
turn and told his guest all his schemes.
âCao Cao wants you to go in to audience. There is no good intention there. Do
not go,â said Huang Kui. âYou lead your army up close to the city and get
Cao Cao to come and review them. When he comes, assassinate him.â
They two settled how this plan could be worked out and the messenger, still hot
with anger and excitement, returned to his home.
Seeing Huang Kui so disturbed in mind, his wife, Lady Zhi, asked him what was
wrong. But he would tell her nothing. However, he had a concubine, Li
Chunxiang. And it happened that she had an intrigue with the wifeâs younger
brother, Miao Ze, who much desired to marry her. The concubine who also saw her
lordâs displeasure, spoke of it to her paramour, and he told her she could
probably draw from him what was wrong by a leading question.
âAsk him what is the truth about two men, Liu Bei and Cao Cao? Who is the
wicked one,â suggested Miao Ze.
That evening Huang Kui went to the apartments of his concubine, and she
presently put the question proposed by her lover.
Her lord, still rather intoxicated, said, âYou are not an official; still you
know right from wrong as well as I. My enemy, and the man I would slay if I
could, is Cao Cao.â
âBut why? And if you wish to slay him, why do you not do something?â said
she.
âI have done something. I have settled with General Ma Teng to assassinate
Cao Cao at the review.â
Li Chunxiang of course told her paramour, who told Cao Cao, and Cao Cao made
his arrangements to defeat the scheme. He called up his trusty generals and
gave them orders for the morrow and, this done, he arrested Huang Kui and all
his household.
Next day, as arranged, Ma Teng and his western troops came close up to the
wall, and among the flags and banners he discerned that of the Prime Minister
himself, whereby he knew that Cao Cao would hold the review in person.
So Ma Teng rode forward. Suddenly a bomb exploded, and at this signal there
appeared bodies of armed troops in four directions: Right and left, front and
rear, led by Xu Chu, Xiahou Yuan, Cao Hong, and Xu Huang. The western forces
were quite hemmed in. Ma Teng then saw the mistake he had made, and he and his
two sons fought valiantly to free themselves from the trap. The youngest son
â-Ma Tie â-soon fell in the volleys of arrows. Father and son rode this way
and that, seeking a way out, but failed on every side. Both were sorely
wounded; and when their steeds fell from their many arrow wounds, both were
captured.
Ma Teng, Ma Xiu, and the miserable Huang Kui who could not keep his counsel,
were brought before Cao Cao. Huang Kui loudly protested his innocence. Cao Cao
then called in the witness Miao Ze.
âThat worthless scoundrel has spoiled all my plans!â cried Ma Teng against
Huang Kui. âNow I cannot slay the rebel and purge my country. But it is the
will of God!â
Father and son were dragged forth, the father uttering volleys of abuse all the
time. And so three men were executed in this adventure.
The sons and father share one niche of fame,
For purest loyalty their praise the same.
To their own hurt the rebels they withstood,
Content to die to make their pledges good.
In blood the solemn oath they did indite
To slay the wicked and preserve the right.
A worthy fatherâs worthy sons by western bride,
Old Waves Quellerâs name his grandson glorified.
âI desire no other reward than Li Chunxiang as wife,â said the betrayer,
Miao Ze.
Cao Cao smiled and said, âFor her sake then you have brought a whole
household to death. What advantage would there be in preserving such a
miscreant?â
So Cao Cao bade the executioners put both the traitor and the woman to death,
with Huang Kuiâs household. Those who saw the fearful vengeance sighed at its
cruelty.
Through passion base a loyal man was slain,
And she who shared his passion shared his fate;
The man they served was pitiless in hate,
And thus a mean manâs treachery was vain.
Cao Cao did not desire to rouse the rancor of the army of Xiliang, wherefore he
proclaimed to them, âThe intended treachery of your leaders was theirs
alone.â
However, he sent to secure the passes so that Ma Dai should not escape.
As has been said, Ma Dai led the rearguard. Before long the fugitives from the
main army came and told him what had occurred at the capital. This frightened
him so much that he abandoned his army and escaped disguised as a trader.
Having slain Ma Teng, Cao Cao decided to set out on his expedition to the
south. But then came the disquieting news of the military preparations of Liu
Bei, whose objective was said to be the west.
This caused Cao Cao alarm, for he said, âThe birdâs wings will be fully
grown if he obtains possession of the West River Land.â
As Cao Cao recognized the difficulty, from among his counselors there arose one
who said, âI know how to prevent Liu Bei and Sun Quan from helping each
other, and both the south and the west will be yours.â
Chill death struck down the heroes of the west,
Calamity approached the bold leaders of the south.
The next chapter will unfold the scheme.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 58 ****
âWhat is this good plan of yours, friend Chen Qun?â asked Cao Cao of the
speaker, who was a civilian in his service.
Chen Qun replied, âYour two principal enemies â-Liu Bei and Sun Quan â-
are now firm allies, close as lips and teeth. But Liu Bei wants the West River
Land and if you, O Prime Minister, send a mighty host against Sun Quan, Sun
Quan must ask help from his friend Liu Bei, who, having his heart set on the
west, will refuse it. Sun Quan without this aid cannot stand and will become so
weak that the South Land will be yours for the taking, and Jingzhou will follow
in a tap of the drum. The west will follow and the whole empire is yours.â
âThose are my thoughts put into words,â replied Cao Cao.
The expeditionary force of three hundred thousand troops set out for the south.
Zhang Liao of Hefei was in command of the supply department.
Sun Quan speedily heard of the move and called in his advisers.
At the council Zhang Zhao said, âLet us send to Lu Su to tell him to write at
once to Liu Bei that he may help us. They are good friends, and Liu Bei will
certainly respond favorably. Beside, since Liu Bei and our lord are now
connected by marriage, there is no risk of refusal. With the support of Liu
Bei, there is no danger to our country.â
Sun Quan listened to this advice and sent to Lu Su bidding him to ask help from
Liu Bei. Accordingly, on receipt of this command, a letter was written to Liu
Bei, who after reading it, retained the messenger at the guest-house till Zhuge
Liang could arrive from Nanjun. As soon as he arrived, Liu Bei showed him the
letter.
The adviser said, âIt is not necessary for the South Landâs troops to move,
nor need we send ours. I can prevent Cao Cao from even daring to look in the
southeast direction.â
So Zhuge Liang wrote a reply telling Lu Su:
âYou can lay aside all anxiety and rest content, for if the northern army
approach, they will be forced backward at once.â
The letter was given to the messenger, and then Liu Bei asked his adviser,
âHow could the Instructor hope to roll back the huge army of three hundred
thousand troops that Cao Cao is preparing to bring south?â
Zhuge Liang replied, âCao Caoâs chief fear is Xiliang. Now just lately he
has slain Ma Teng and his sons as well, and the people of Xiliang are grinding
their teeth with rage. Now you must write and ask Ma Chao to march through the
pass, and Cao Cao will have no leisure to think of any expedition to the
south.â
The letter was written, sent by a trusty hand, and duly delivered.
Now Ma Chao was in Xiliang. One night he had a vision. In his dream he saw
himself lying out on a snowy plain and many tigers were coming up and biting
him. He awoke in a fright and began to wonder what the dream portended. Failing
to explain it, he told the dream to his officers. One of them ventured to say
the portent was evil. This was General Pang De.
âWhat is your interpretation?â asked Ma Chao.
âMeeting with tigers on a snowy plain is a very inauspicious subject to dream
about. Assuredly our old General is in trouble at the capital.â
And at that moment one entered in hot haste and cast himself on the earth,
weeping and crying, âThe Uncle and his sons are dead!â
It was Ma Dai, the nephew of Ma Teng. And he told the story of the evil:
âUncle Ma Teng and Huang Kui had planned to assassinate Cao Cao, but the plot
had miscarried and become known. Ma Tie fell in the battlefield, Uncle Ma Teng
and Ma Xiu were put to death in the market place, and I escaped in disguise.â
Ma Chao fell to the ground and wept bitterly, grinding his teeth with rage at
his enemy Cao Cao. They lifted him to his feet and led him away to repose.
Soon after arrived a messenger with a letter from Liu Bei, which read like
this:
âIn these latter days of the hapless Hans, when the rebellious and tyrannical
Cao Cao monopolizes all power, to the injury of the Emperor and the
wretchedness of the people, I, Liu Bei, recall that your father and I were
recipients of an edict and we swore to exterminate the recreant. Now your
father has suffered death at the hands of the tyrant, and you must avenge him.
As the holy books say, you cannot let the same sky cover you nor the same
sunshine upon you and your fatherâs murderer. If you can lead your army to
attack Cao Cao on one side, I will march my armies to prevent his retreat, and
he will be taken, and all his evil crew can be exterminated. Then and thus will
your father be avenged, and the Hans can be restored. I might add more, but I
will await your reply.â
Wiping his tears, Ma Chao wrote a reply which was returned by the bearer.
The Xiliang army was then mustered; horse and foot were assembled. Just before
the day that had been fixed for the start, the Imperial Protector of Xizhou,
Han Sui, sent for Ma Chao, to whom he showed a letter from Cao Cao promising
the Lordship of Xiliang as a reward for sending Ma Chao a prisoner to the
capital.
âBind us both, Uncle, and send us thither! You need not move a single
spear,â said the younger man prostrating himself.
But Han Sui raised him, saying, âYour father and I were sworn brothers. Think
you I would harm you? Rather will I help if you are going to fight.â
Ma Chao expressed his gratitude. The unhappy bearer of Cao Caoâs letter was
dragged forth and beheaded. This done, the two took count of their armies. Han
Sui had eight divisions under eight commanders â-Yang Qiu, Cheng Yin, Hou
Xuan, Liang Xing, Cheng Yi, Li Kan, Ma Wan, and Zhang Han â-all to be relied
upon to follow Han Sui. Ma Chao had two leaders, Pang De and Ma Dai. The total
force was two hundred thousand troops with which the commanders march to
Changan.
The Governor of that city was Zhong Yao. As soon as he heard what was afoot, he
sent a fleet messenger to Cao Cao and prepared for defense. He led his force
out into the open plain and arrayed it for battle.
Ma Dai, with fifteen thousand, came on first, pouring over the countryside like
a flood. Zhong Yao would parley with him, but Ma Dai came forward, sword in
hand, to attack. However, the defender did not take the challenge but turned
and fled. Ma Dai followed in pursuit. Soon the main body of the invaders
arrived, and they surrounded the city, which Zhong Yao set about defending.
Changan had been the capital of the Western Han and so was well fortified with
a solid wall and a deep moat, safe against the most terrific attacks. The new
armies besieged the city for ten days without success. Then Pang De proposed a
plan.
Said he, âSince the land about the city is barren and the water bitter, the
people must have communication with the country around in order to live.
Further they have no fuel. Ten days of siege must have exhausted the supplies
in the city, wherefore if we relax for a time â-well, you will see. We shall
capture the city without moving a finger.â
âYour plan seems excellent,â said Ma Chao, when he heard what it was.
Thereupon they sent orders to each division to retire, and Ma Chao covered the
retreat. Next day Zhong Yao went up on the walls to look around and saw that
the besiegers had gone. However, suspecting a ruse, he sent out spies, who
returned to say the soldiers had really moved away to a distance. Wherefore he
felt much relieved and allowed both soldiers and people to go out into the
country to cut the much needed firewood and bring in water. The city gates,
thrown wide open, were thronged with those passing in and out.
This continued for five days, and then they heard that Ma Chaoâs army was
returning. A panic ensued. The people rushed into the city, and the gates were
once more barred.
The commander of the west gate was Zhong Jing, brother of Zhong Yao. About the
third watch of the night, a torch was seen moving just inside the gate; and
when Zhong Jing went to see what was wrong, and was passing the gateway, a man
suddenly galloped up and slashed at him with a sword.
At the same time the attacker shouted, âHere is Pang De!â
Zhong Jing was taken aback, could not defend himself and was cut down. The gate
guard was soon disposed of, the gates were shattered, and the soldiers of Ma
Chao and Han Sui came pouring in. Zhong Yao escaped by the opposite gate and
left the city in the hands of his enemies. He reached Tong Pass, where he
fortified himself and sent news of the misfortune to Cao Cao.
Cao Cao threw aside all plans for his expedition to the south when Changan was
lost.
He at once gave orders, âCao Hong and Xu Huang are to march your ten thousand
troops to Tong Pass to support Zhong Yao. You are to hold the Pass at all costs
for ten days, or you will pay for its loss with your heads. After ten days the
Pass will be no concern of yours, for I will be there with the main army.â
Cao Ren said, âCao Hong short of temper is unfitted to hold the Pass.
Everything could happen.â
Cao Cao replied, âYou will go to reinforce him.â
Cao Hong and Xu Huang made all haste to Tong Pass and took over the command
from Zhong Yao. They confined themselves to defense; and though Ma Chao
appeared every day and reviled and shouted shameful things of the three
generations of Cao Caoâs family, the guardians of the Pass remained quiet.
But Cao Hong fretted at the daily insults and would have led the defenders out
to fight had not his colleague restrained him.
âMa Chao only wishes to provoke you to come out, but remember our orders and
go not. The Prime Minister has some master plan.â
So spoke Xu Huang. But the advice was hard to follow, for Ma Chaoâs soldiers
took turns in reviling the defenders of the Pass, resting neither day nor
night. And Xu Huang found it hard to curb his colleagueâs impatience.
Thus it continued till the ninth day. Then the defenders saw that their enemies
had turned all their horses loose and were lolling about on the grass and
sleeping as if quite fatigued.
Thereupon Cao Hong bade them saddle his horse, told off three thousand troops,
and soon this small force was dashing down to catch the besiegers unprepared.
The soldiers of Ma Chao at once fled, leaving their steeds and throwing aside
their weapons. Cao Hong could not resist pursuit and chased them.
At this time Xu Huang was higher up the road taking in cartloads of grain and
forage. But when he heard what his impulsive colleague had done, he hastily got
a force together and went to his rescue. He shouted to Cao Hong to return.
Suddenly a great shouting arose near Xu Huang, and out dashed Ma Dai to attack.
Both Cao Hong and Xu Huang turned to flee, but the drums rolled and two bodies
of troops led by Ma Chao and Pang De came out from behind the hills. Then a
battle began which went against Cao Caoâs troops from the first. They fell
fast, but some of them cut an alley through the press and made for the Pass.
Their enemies flooded into the Pass in close pursuit, and they had to abandon
their post and flee whither they could find a way.
Pang De pursued after Cao Hong, but Cao Ren came to his rescue and they both
fled. Ma Chao and Pang De took the Pass.
Cao Hong made all haste to his master to give him the evil tidings.
âWhen I gave you the limit of ten days, why did you leave the Pass on the
ninth?â
âThose soldiers from Xiliang hurled every sort of insult at us,â replied
Cao Hong. âAnd when I thought I had them unprepared, I took the opportunity.
But I fell victim to their cunning.â
âYou are young and impetuous. But, Xu Huang, you ought to have known.â
Xu Huang said, âHe would not listen, though I told him many times. And that
day I was taking in stores in another part of the Pass. As soon as they told
me, I felt sure there would be some misfortune, and so I hastened after him,
but it was too late.â
Cao Cao was annoyed and ordered Cao Hong to be put to death. But his colleague
officers begged that he might be pardoned, and as he had confessed his fault,
he was allowed to go free and unpunished.
Cao Cao advanced to Tong Pass.
Cao Ren said, âWe should establish a strong stockade before attacking.â
So trees were felled and a strong stockade built. They made three camps: Cao
Ren was in the left; Xiahou Yuan, the right; and Cao Cao himself was in the
center one.
Soon after, Cao Cao and all his officers in a body rushed to attack the Pass.
They ran against the Xiliang troops posted on two sides, halted and formed
their array. This done, Cao Cao rode to the center standard whence he looked at
his opponents.
He saw before him a body of fine troops, everyone with the bearing of a hero.
And the leader, Ma Chao, was worthy of them, with his vivid face as if powdered
and red lips as if colored, his supple hips and broad shoulders, his deep voice
and fierce strength. He was wearing silver helmet and armor and gripping a long
spear as he sat there on his charger. Pang De and Ma Dai supported him, and Cao
Cao admired Ma Chao in his secret heart.
However, Cao Cao urged forward his steed and shouted to Ma Chao, âWhy are you
arrayed against the Hans, whom your father and grandfather served
faithfully?â
Ma Chao ground his teeth and cursed Cao Cao, âRebel! Betrayer of both prince
and people! Murderer of my father and brothers! My hate for you is to the
death: The same sky shall not continue to cover us, for I will take you captive
and satiate my appetite on your living flesh.â
With this he set his spear and rode over toward Cao Cao as if to slay him. But
Yu Jin came out from behind and engaged Ma Chao in battle. These two fought
some half score bouts, and then Yu Jin had to flee. Zhang He, however, took his
place and the two warriors exchanged twenty passes. Then Zhang He, too, ran
away.
Next to come forth was Li Tong. Ma Chaoâs martial prowess was now at its
height, and he made short work of Li Tong, who went out of the saddle at the
first blow. Then Ma Chao flourished his spear at the troops behind him as a
signal for them to come on, which they did like a flood. They overwhelmed Cao
Caoâs forces, and Ma Chao, Pang De, and Ma Dai rode forward to try to capture
Cao Cao.
They came close. Cao Cao heard one of his pursuers shout to another, âCao Cao
is he in the red dress!â
So he hastily tore off his red robe and threw it away. He also heard one say
âCao Cao is he with the long beard!â
At once Cao Cao took the sword that he wore at his side and sawed off some of
the beard. Yet again a soldier recognized him and told Ma Chao that Cao Cao had
now cut his beard, whereupon the order went forth to capture short beards. And
then Cao Cao wrapped the corner of a flag about neck and jowl and fled.
Panic seized upon the soldiers at Tong Pass;
Frightened, Cao Cao flung off his brocade robe
And, terror-stricken, sawed his beard off with a sword.
The fame of Ma Chao rose even to the sky.
Cao Cao had got clear of the battle and was getting calmer. Then again the
sound of hoofs fell upon his ears. And on looking round, he perceived Ma Chao
quite close. He and those near were panic-stricken, and all scattered for their
lives, careless of the fate of their leader.
âCao Cao, do not flee!â cried Ma Chao coming nearer.
The whip dropped from Cao Caoâs nerveless hand as he saw his enemy coming
closer and closer. But just as Ma Chao had leveled his spear for a thrust, Cao
Cao slipped behind a tree, changed the direction of his flight and so escaped,
while Ma Chao struck the tree. He quickly pulled out his spear, but the delay
gave the fugitive an advantage, although it did not quite free him from
pursuit, for Ma Chao was soon again galloping on his track.
As they drew near the slope of some hills, a bold general suddenly appeared,
who cried, âDo not hurt my lord!â
This was Cao Hong, and he went toward Ma Chao, whirling his sword. Ma Chao was
stopped, and this saved Cao Caoâs life. Cao Hong and Ma Chao fought half a
hundred bouts till Cao Hong began to grow weary and become uncertain of his
strokes. And when, shortly after, Xiahou Yuan appeared with some thirty
horsemen, Ma Chao found it prudent to retire.
Then Cao Cao was escorted to his camp defended by Cao Ren. He found the camps
were still unharmed and the losses had not been great.
As he sat in his tent, Cao Cao said, âHad I not spared Cao Hong, I should
have fallen at the hands of Ma Chao today.â
So he called in his rescuer and rewarded him well.
And they got together the scattered troops and strengthened the camp, deepening
the moat and raising the rampart. Ma Chao came daily and challenged anyone to
combat and abused them all shamefully, but, by the order of the Prime Minister,
these insults were treated with silent contempt.
âOur enemies use long spears,â said the officers. âWe will meet them with
bows and crossbows.â
âThey may have long spears,â replied Cao Cao, âbut whether I give battle
or not depends on my decision. How can they thrust at us if we do not go out?
All you have to do is to take no notice of them, and they will speedily
retire.â
The officers wondered. They said one to another, âThe Prime Minister came out
on this expedition of his own will and was foremost in the fight. Why does he
accept defeat so easily?â
After some days the spies reported: âMa Chao has been reinforced by twenty
thousand Qiangs, the tribespeople beyond the frontier.â
Cao Cao took the news gleefully. His officers asked him why the news pleased
him.
He replied, âWait till I have defeated them, and I will explain.â
Three days later there was a report of further reinforcements, and Cao Cao not
only smiled but gave a banquet. His officers ridiculed him in secret.
Then said Cao Cao, âYou gentlemen laugh because I cannot destroy Ma Chao.
Well then, can anyone of you propose a plan?â
Then rose Xu Huang and said, âO Prime Minister, you have a large force here,
and the enemy also accumulate their strength on the Pass. This means that on
the west side of Yellow River, behind their back, they are unprepared. If you
can get an army secretly across the river and cross the Cattail Ferry, you will
cut off their retreat. Then if you can march down and smite them on the banks
of River Wei, they can get no reinforcements and must fail.â
âWhat you propose is just what I think,â said Cao Cao.
So Xu Huang was placed over four thousand troops, and with Zhu Ling, marched to
the west of Yellow River and hid in the gullies. They were to wait till Cao Cao
crossed the Yellow River so that both could strike together.
Then Cao Cao ordered Cao Hong to prepare boats and rafts. Cao Ren was left in
command of the camps. Cao Cao himself marched to the east bank of Yellow River
first, and from there attempted to cross to the west bank.
When Ma Chao heard of the new military movements, he said, âI understand. The
Pass is left, rafts are being prepared: That means that he is going to cross to
the west side and cut off my retreat. I must coast along the river and keep him
off. If I can do that, his food will run short within twenty days in the east
bank, and that will cause a mutiny. Then I will travel south along the river
and attack.â
Han Sui did not approve this plan. He quoted the military maxim to strike when
troops were half over the river.
âAttack from the south when his army is in the act of crossing, and his army
will be drowned in the river,â said he.
âUncle, your words are good,â replied Ma Chao. And the spies went forth to
find out the time of crossing the river.
When Cao Caoâs preparations were complete and all was ready, he sent three
parties of soldiers over the river first. They reached the ferry at the first
sign of dawn, and the veterans were sent over first and lay out a camp. Cao Cao
and his guard took up station on the east bank to watch the crossing.
Very soon the sentinels reported, âA general dressed all in white is
approaching.â
Everyone knew it must be Ma Chao. This terrified them and they made a rush to
get into the boats. The river bank became a scene of shouting men struggling
who could first embark. Cao Cao sat watching and never stirred. He only issued
orders to stop the confusion. Meanwhile, the yelling of the troops and the
neighing of the horses of the approaching army came nearer and nearer.
Suddenly a general jumped out of one of the boats and shouted to Cao Cao:
âThe rebels are close! Get into a boat, O Prime Minister!â
âThe rebels are near. What matter?â replied Cao Cao simply to the speaker,
who was Xu Chu. And he turned round to look at them.
As a fact Ma Chao was very close, not a hundred paces away, and Xu Chu laid
hold of Cao Cao and dragged him down the bank. The boat had already pushed off
and was ten spans from the bank, but Xu Chu took Cao Cao on his back and leaped
on board. The boat was small and in danger of being overturned, wherefore Xu
Chu drew his sword and chopped away at the hands clinging to the side so that
the soldiers fell back into the water.
The boat went down stream, Xu Chu standing in the prow poling as hard as he
could. His master crouched out of sight at his feet.
When Ma Chao saw the boat in midstream drifting down with the current, he took
his bow and arrows and began to shoot. He also ordered his brave generals to go
along the river and shoot so that a shower of arrows fell about the boat. Xu
Chu fearing Cao Cao would be wounded, protected him with a saddle which he held
over him with his left hand, for Ma Chaoâs shooting was not in vain. Many of
the soldiers working the boat were wounded. Some had fallen overboard, while
more lay in the bottom of the boat. The boat itself got out of control and was
whirled hither and thither by the current. Xu Chu straddled over the tiller and
tried thus to guide the boat, while he poled with one hand and with the other
held the protecting saddle over Cao Caoâs head.
Then the Magistrate of Weinan, Ding Fei, who from a hill top saw that Cao Cao
was very closely pressed, even in danger of his life, drove out from his camp
all the cattle and horses there, so that they scattered over the hillside. This
was too much for the born Qiang herdsmen of the plains. At sight of the beasts,
they left the river and ran off to secure the cattle. Nor had they any
inclination to pursue their enemy.
And so Cao Cao escaped. As soon as they reached the west bank of Yellow River
(which was also the north bank of River Wei), the boat was scuttled. The rumor
had spread that Cao Cao was on the river and in danger, so all his officers
came to his aid. But he was now safe on shore. Xu Chuâs double armor was
stuck full of arrows. The officers escorted Cao Cao to the camp where they made
their obeisance and expressed the hope that he had not suffered seriously.
âThe rebels very nearly caught me today,â said he smiling.
âThey would have got across the river, had they not been enticed away by the
freeing of the cattle and horses,â said Xu Chu.
âWho was it that drew them off?â said Cao Cao.
Someone who knew told him. Before long Magistrate Ding Fei came in to pay his
respects, and Cao Cao thanked him.
âI should have been a prisoner but for your happy thought,â said Cao Cao.
And the magistrate received a rank of Commander in the army.
âThough they have gone, yet they will assuredly return tomorrow,â said Ding
Fei. âYou must prepare to repel them.â
âMy preparations are all made,â was the reply.
Cao Cao ordered his generals to spread themselves along the river bank and
throw up mounds as shelters for camps. If they saw the enemy approaching, the
soldiers were to be withdrawn from behind the mounds, leaving the ensigns all
flying, so as to give the impression that each camp contained a garrison. Along
the river they were to dig ditches and put up sheds, thus to entice the enemy
there and their army would stumble into the pits and fall easy victims.
Ma Chao returned to Han Sui and told him, saying, âI would have captured Cao
Cao, but a certain bold general had taken him on his back and leaped with him
into a boat.â
Han Sui replied, âI have heard that Cao Cao had a body guard of the bravest
and strongest soldiers under the command of Dian Wei and Xu Chu. They are
called the Tiger Guard. Now as Dian Wei is dead, the man you saw must have been
Xu Chu. He is both brave and powerful and goes by the name of Tiger Lust. You
will do well to avoid him.â
âI know his name, too,â said Ma Chao.
âCao Cao now means to attack our rear,â continued Han Sui. âLet us attack
first, before he can establish camps and stockades. If once he can do that, it
will be difficult to dislodge him.â
âMy idea is that we should hold the north bank of River Wei, and prevent him
from crossing south.â
âWorthy nephew, keep guard here while I go along the bank of the river and
fight Cao Cao.â
âIf you will take Pang De as your Van Leader, I am content,â said Ma Chao.
So Han Sui and Pang De, with fifty thousand troops, went away down to the River
Wei, while Cao Cao again warned his generals to entice the enemy. Pang De was
in advance with a goodly squadron of iron-clad horsemen, and they burst along
at full speed. Then there arose a confused shouting as they all went plunging
into the ditches prepared for them. Pang De soon leaped out, gained the level
ground, and laid about him with all his might. He slew many Cao Caoâs
soldiers and presently got out of the thick of the fight.
But Han Sui had also been involved, and Pang De went afoot to try to aid him.
On the way he met Cao Yong, a general of Cao Ren. Pang De cut Cao Yong down.
Then mounting the dead manâs steed, he rode forward fiercely, slaying as he
passed. He reached his leader whom he led away southeast. The troops of Cao Cao
pursued him, but Ma Chao came with reinforcements and drove them off. Ma Chao
rescued a great number, and they continued fighting till evening when they
withdrew and mustered their troops. Two commanders, Cheng Yin and Zhang Han,
were missing, and a couple of hundred soldiers had been killed when they fell
into the pits.
Ma Chao and Han Sui discussed what should next be done.
âIf we give the enemy time, he will make himself strong on the north bank. I
think we can do no better than to raid his camp tonight,â said Ma Chao.
âWe must have a force and supports for it,â said Han Sui.
So it was decided that Ma Chao should lead the striking force with Pang De and
Ma Dai as supports. They would start at nightfall.
Now Cao Caoâs troops were on the north bank of River Wei, and he gave his
generals orders, saying, âThe rebels will try to surprise us as they are
deceived by my not having set up stockades. You will place your soldiers in
ambush. At the bomb signal, you will rush out from four directions to capture
them.â
At nightfall Ma Chao sent out a small scouting party headed by Cheng Yi. Seeing
nothing, Cheng Yi penetrated deep into the enemyâs lines. Presently, a bomb
was exploded. Out leapt the hidden troops, and in a few moments the whole
scouting party were killed. Cheng Yi was cut down by the blade of Xiahou Yuan.
But close at hand came the main army led by Ma Chao, Ma Dai, and Pang De that
rushed into the ambush forces.
Wait for the foe all undismayed.
Place your men in ambuscade.
Generals striving to outvie
Are not beaten easily.
Who got the advantage will presently be told.

**** Chapter 59 ****
off, Ma Chao camping on the River Wei, whence he kept up harassing attacks both
day and night. Cao Cao, also camped in the bed of the same river, began to
construct three floating bridges out of his rafts and boats so as to facilitate
communication with the south bank. Cao Ren established a stockade near the
camp, which he barricaded with his carts and wagons.
Ma Chao determined to destroy this stockade, so his troops collected straw and
each man marched with a bundle and took fire with him. Han Suiâs forces were
to fight. While one party attacked, the other party piled up the straw, which
they lit, and soon there was a fierce fire all around. The defenders could do
nothing against it, so they abandoned the stockade and ran away. All the
transport and bridges were destroyed. It was a great victory for the Xiliang
army and gave them the command of the River Wei.
Cao Cao was sad at the failure to make good his strong camp and fearful of his
defenselessness. Then Xun You proposed a mud wall. So three thousand soldiers
were set to build a mud rampart. The enemy seeing this harassed the workmen
with perpetual attacks at different points so that the work went slowly.
Beside, the soil was very sandy, and the wall would not stand but collapsed as
fast as it was built. Cao Cao felt helpless.
It was the ninth month of the sixteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 211),
and the fierce cold of winter was just coming on. Ominous clouds covered the
sky day after day with never a break. One day as Cao Cao sat in his tent, very
disheartened, a stranger was announced and was led in. He was an old man who
said he had a suggestion to offer. He was tall, as delicate as a crane and as
refined as a pine tree. He gave his name as Lou Zibo and said he came from
Jingzhao. He was a recluse and a Daoist, his religious name being Plum-Blossom
Dreamer.
Cao Cao received him with great courtesy, and presently the venerable one
began, saying, âO Prime Minister, you have long been striving to make a camp
on the river. Now is your opportunity. Why not begin?â
âThe soil is too sandy to stand,â said Cao Cao. âBut if you have some
other plan to propose, pray tell me what it is, O Hermit.â
âYou are more than human, O Prime Minister, in the art of war, and you surely
know the times and seasons. It has been overcast for many days, and these
clouds foretell a north wind and intense cold. When the wind begins to blow,
you should hurry your army to carry up the earth and sprinkle it with water. By
dawn your wall will be complete.â
Cao Cao seized upon the suggestion. He offered his aged visitor a reward, but
the venerable one would receive nothing.
That night the wind came down in full force. Every man possible was set to
earth-carrying and wetting. As they had no other means of carrying water, they
made stuff bags which they filled with water and let out the water over the
earth. And so as they piled the earth, they froze it solid with water, and by
dawn the wall was finished and stood firm.
When his scouts told Ma Chao that the enemy had built a wall, he rode out and
saw it. Ma Chao was greatly perplexed and began to suspect help from the gods.
However, very soon after, he got his whole army together and sounded an attack.
Cao Cao himself rode out of the camp, with only the redoubtable Xu Chu in
attendance, and advanced toward the enemy.
Flourishing his whip he called out, âI, Cao Cao, am here alone, and I beg Ma
Chao to come out to parley with me.â
Thereupon Ma Chao rode out, his spear set ready to thrust.
âYou despised me because I had no wall to my camp, but lo! in one single
night, God has made me a wall. Do you not think it time to give in?â
Ma Chao was so enraged that he almost rushed at Cao Cao, but he was not too
angry to notice the henchman behind him, glaring in angry fashion, who held a
gleaming sword in his grip. Ma Chao thought this man could be no other than Xu
Chu, so he determined to find out.
With a flourish of his whip, he said, âWhere is the noble âMarquis Tigerâ
that I hear you have in your camp?â
At this Xu Chu lifted his sword and roared, âI am Xu Chu of Qiao!â
From Xu Chuâs eyes shot gleams of supernatural light and his attitude was so
terror-striking that Ma Chao dared not move. He turned his steed and retired.
Cao Cao and his doughty follower returned to their camp. As they two passed
between the armies, not a man there but felt a quiver of fear.
âThey know our friend Xu Chu over there as Marquis Tiger,â said Cao Cao
when he returned.
And thereafter the soldiers all called Xu Chu by that name.
âI will capture that fellow Ma Chao tomorrow,â said Xu Chu.
âMa Chao is very bold,â said his master. âBe careful!â
âI swear to fight him to the death,â said Xu Chu.
Then Xu Chu sent a written challenge to his enemy saying that the Marquis Tiger
challenged Ma Chao to a decisive duel on the morrow.
Ma Chao was very angry when he received the letter.
âDare he insult me so?â cried he. Then he wrote his pledge to slay Tiger
Lust on the morrow.
Next day both armies moved out and arrayed in order of battle. Ma Chao gave
Pang De and Ma Dai command of the two wings, while Han Sui took the center.
Ma Chao took up his station in front of the center and shouted, âWhere is the
Tiger Lust?â
Cao Cao, who was on horseback by the standard, turned and said, âMa Chao is
no less bold than Lu Bu!â
As he spoke, Xu Chu rode forth whirling his sword and the duel began. They
fought over a hundred bouts, and neither had the advantage. But then, their
steeds being spent with galloping to and fro, each retired within his own lines
and obtained a fresh mount. The contest was renewed, and a hundred more
encounters took place, still without victory to either.
Suddenly Xu Chu galloped back to his own side, stripped off his armor, showing
his magnificent muscles and, naked as he was, leaped again into the saddle and
rode out to continue the battle.
Again the champions engaged, while both armies stood aghast. Thirty bouts more,
and Xu Chu, summoning up all his force, plunged toward Ma Chao with his sword
held high to strike. But Ma Chao avoided the stroke and rode in with his spear
pointing directly at his opponentâs heart. Throwing down his sword, Xu Chu
dashed aside the spear, which passed underneath his arm.
Then ensued a struggle for the spear, and Xu Chu by a mighty effort snapped the
shaft so that each held one half. Then the duel was continued, each be laboring
the other with the pieces of the broken spear.
At this point Cao Cao began to fear for his champion and so ordered two of his
generals, Xiahou Yuan and Cao Hong, to go out and take a hand. At this Pang De
and Ma Dai gave the signal to their armored horsemen to attack. They rode in,
and a melee began in which Cao Caoâs troops were worsted, and the great
champion Xu Chu received two arrow wounds in the shoulder. So the troops of Cao
Cao retreated to their stockade, Ma Chao following them to the river. Cao
Caoâs army lost more than half their number.
Cao Cao barred his gates and allowed none to go out.
Ma Chao went down to the river. When he saw Han Sui, he said, âI have seen
some wicked fighters, but none to match that Xu Chu. He is aptly nicknamed
Tiger Lustâ
Thinking that by strategy he might get the better of Ma Chao, Cao Cao secretly
sent two bodies of troops across the river to the south bank to take up
position so that he might attack in front and rear.
One day from his ramparts, Cao Cao saw Ma Chao and a few horsemen ride close up
to the walls and then gallop to and fro like the wind.
After gazing at them for a long time, Cao Cao tore off his helmet and dashed it
on the ground, saying, âIf that Ma Chao is not killed, may I never know my
place of burial!â
Xiahou Yuan heard his master, and his heart burned within him. He cried, âMay
I die here at once if I do not destroy that rebel!â
Without more ado, Xiahou Yuan flung open the gates and rode out with his
company. Cao Cao tried to stop this mad rush, but it was no good. So, fearing
Xiahou Yuan might come to grief, Cao Cao rode out after him. At sight of the
soldiers of Cao Cao, Ma Chao faced his troops about, extended them in line and,
as the enemy approached, dashed forward to the attack. Then noticing Cao Cao
himself among them, Ma Chao left Xiahou Yuan and rode straight for Cao Cao.
Panic seized Cao Cao and he rode for his life, while his troops were thrown
into confusion.
It was during the pursuit of this portion of the Cao Caoâs army that Ma Chao
was told of a force of the enemy on the south of River Wei. Realizing the
danger, he abandoned the pursuit, called in his forces, and went to his own
camp, there to consult with Han Sui.
âWhat now? Cao Cao has crossed to the south of the river, and we can be
attacked in the rear,â said Ma Chao.
Commander Li Kan said, âThen you had better come to an agreement, sacrifice
some territory, and make peace. Then both can repose through the winter and
await the changes and chances that may come with the spring warmth.â
âHe is wise,â said Han Sui, âand I advise the same.â
But Ma Chao hesitated. Others exhorted him to make peace, and at length he
agreed. So Yang Qiu and Hou Xuan were sent as messengers of peace to the camp
of Cao Cao.
âYou may return. I will send my reply,â said Cao Cao when they had declared
the purport of their mission. And they left.
Then Jia Xu said to Cao Cao, âWhat is your opinion, O Prime Minister?â
âWhat is yours?â asked Cao Cao.
âWar allows deceit, therefore pretend to agree. Then we can try some means of
sowing suspicions between Han Sui and Ma Chao so that we may thereby destroy
both.â
Cao Cao clapped his hands for very joy, saying, âThat is the best idea of
all! Most suitable! You and I agree in our ideas. I was just thinking of
that.â
So an answer was returned:
âLet me gradually withdraw my soldiers, and I will give back the land
belonging to you on the west of Yellow River.â
And at the same time Cao Cao ordered the construction of a floating bridge to
help in the withdrawal to the east side.
When the reply arrived, Ma Chao said to Han Sui, âAlthough he agrees to
peace, yet he is evil and crafty. We must remain prepared against his
machinations. Uncle, you and I will take turns in watching Cao Cao and Xu Huang
on alternate days. So shall we be safe against his treachery.â
They agreed and began the regular alternate watch. Soon Cao Cao got to know
what they were doing, and he turned to Jia Xu, saying, âI am succeeding.â
âWho keeps the look-out on the north bank tomorrow?â asked Cao Cao.
âHan Sui,â replied someone.
Next day Cao Cao at the head of a large party of his generals rode out of the
camp, and the officers presently spread out right and left, he himself
remaining a solitary rider visible in the center. Han Sui did not know that Cao
Cao had come out.
Presently Cao Cao called out, âDo any of you soldiers want to see Cao Cao?
Here I am quite alone. I have not four eyes nor a couple of mouths, but I am
very knowing.â
The soldiers turned pale with fright. Then Cao Cao called up a man and told him
to go and see Han Sui and say, âSir, the Prime Minister humbly asks you to
come and confer with him.â
Thereupon Han Sui went out, and seeing Cao Cao wore no armor, Han Sui also
threw off his and rode out clad in a light robe. Each rode up to the other till
their horseâs heads nearly touched, and there they stood talking.
Said Cao Cao, âYour father and I were granted filial degrees at the same
time, and I used to treat him as an uncle. Moreover, you and I set out to serve
the court at the same time, too, and yet we have not met for years. How old may
you be now, General?â
âI am forty,â replied Han Sui.
âIn those old days in the capital, we were both very young and never thought
about middle age. If we could only restore tranquillity to the state, that
would be a matter of rejoicing.â
After that they chatted long about old times, but neither said a word on
military matters. They gossiped for a couple of hours before they took leave of
each other.
It was not long before someone told Ma Chao of this meeting, and he went over
to his ally to ask about it.
âWhat was it Cao Cao came out to discuss today?â said Ma Chao.
âHe just recalled the old days when we were together in the capital.â
âDid he say nothing about military matters?â
âNot a word; and I could not talk about them alone.â
Ma Chao went out without a word, but he felt suspicious.
When Cao Cao returned to his camp, he said to Jia Xu, âDo you know why I
talked with him thus publicly?â
âIt may be an excellent idea,â said Jia Xu, âbut it is not sufficient
simply to estrange two people. I can improve on it, and we will make them
quarrel and even kill each other.â
âWhat is your scheme?â
âMa Chao is brave but not very astute. You write a letter with your own hand
to Han Sui himself and put in it some rambling statements about some harm that
is going to happen. Then blot it out and write something else. Afterwards you
will send it to Han Sui, taking care that Ma Chao shall know all about it. Ma
Chao will demand to read the letter, and when he sees that the important part
of the letter has been changed, he will think that Han Sui has made the changes
lest his secrets should leak out. This will fit into the private talk you had
with Han Sui the other day, and the suspicion will grow until it has brought
about trouble. I can also secretly corrupt some of Han Suiâs subordinates,
and get them to widen the breach. Then we can settle Ma Chao.â
âThe scheme looks excellent,â said Cao Cao.
And he wrote the letter as suggested, and then erased and changed it, after
which he sealed it securely and sent it across to Han Sui.
Surely enough someone told Ma Chao about the letter, which increased his
doubts, and he came to Han Suiâs quarters to ask to see it. Han Sui gave it
to him, and the erasures and alterations struck Ma Chao at once.
âWhy are all these alterations here?â asked he.
âIt came like that. I do not know.â
âDoes anyone send a rough draft like this? It seems to me, Uncle, that you
are afraid I shall know something or other too well, and so you have changed
the wording.â
âIt must be that Cao Cao has sealed up the rough draft by mistake.â
âI do not think so. He is a careful man and would not make such a mistake.
You and I, Uncle, have been allies in trying to slay the rebel. Why are you
turning against me now?â
âIf you doubt my word, I will tell you what you can do. Tomorrow, in full
view of the army, I will get Cao Cao to come out and talk. You can hide in
behind the ranks ready to kill me if I am false.â
âThat being so, I shall know that you are true, Uncle.â
This arrangement made, next day Han Sui with five generals in his train â-Li
Kan, Ma Wan, Yang Qiu, Hou Xuan, and Liang Xing â-rode to the front, while Ma
Chao concealed himself behind the great standard. Han Sui sent over to say that
he wished to speak to the Prime Minister.
Thereupon at his command, Cao Hong, with a train of ten horsemen rode out,
advanced straight to Han Sui, leaned over to him and said, loudly enough to be
heard plainly, âLast night the Prime Minister quite understood. Let there be
no mistake.â
Then without another word on either side Cao Hong rode away.
Ma Chao had heard. He gripped his spear and started galloping out to slay his
companion in arms. But the five generals checked him and begged him to go back
to camp.
When Han Sui saw him, he said, âNephew, trust me, really I have no evil
intentions.â
But Ma Chao, burning with rage, went away. Then Han Sui talked over the matter
with his five generals.
âHow can this be cleared up?â
âMa Chao trusts too much to his strength,â said Yang Qiu. âHe is always
inclined to despise you, Sir. If we overcome Cao Cao, do you think he will give
way to you? I think you should rather take care of your own interests, go over
to the Prime Ministerâs side, and you will surely get rank one day.â
âI was his fatherâs pledged brother and could not bear to desert him,â
said Han Sui.
âIt seems to me that as things have come to this pass: You simply have to
now.â
âWho would act as go-between?â asked Han Sui.
âI will,â said Yang Qiu.
Then Han Sui wrote a private letter which he confided to Yang Qiu, who soon
found his way over to the other camp. Cao Cao was only too pleased, and he
promised that Han Sui should be made Lord of Xiliang and Yang Qiu its Governor.
The other confederates should be rewarded in other ways. Then a plot was
planned: When the preparations for the act of treachery were complete, a
bonfire was to be lighted in Han Suiâs camp, and all would try to do away
with Ma Chao.
Yang Qiu went back and related all this to his chief, and Han Sui felt elated
at the success of his overtures. A lot of wood was collected in camp at the
back of his tent ready for the signal blaze, and the five generals got ready
for the foul deed. It was decided that Ma Chao should be persuaded into coming
to a banquet, and there they would slay him then.
All this was done, but not without some hesitation and delay, and some news of
the plot reached Ma Chao. He found out the careful preparations that had been
made and resolved to act first. Leaving Ma Dai and Pang De in reserve, he chose
a few trusted leaders and with stealthy steps made his way into Han Suiâs
tent. There he found Han Sui and his five confederates deep in conversation. He
just caught a word or two that Yang Qiu said, âWe must not delay, now is the
time.â
In burst Ma Chao raging and yelling, âYou herd of rebels! Would you dare to
plot against me?â
They were taken aback. Ma Chao sprang at Han Sui and slashed at his face. Han
Sui put up his hand to ward off the blow, and his hand was cut off. The five
drew their swords and set on Ma Chao and his men, who rushed outside. Soon Ma
Chao was hemmed in by the five, but he kept them at bay by wonderful
swordsmanship. And as the swords flashed, the red blood flowed. Soon Ma Wan was
down and Liang Xing disabled; then the other three fled.
Ma Chao ran back into the tent to finish Han Sui, but the servants had removed
him. Then a torch was lit, and soon there was commotion all through the camp.
Ma Chao mounted his horse, for Pang De and Ma Dai had now arrived, and the real
fight began. Cao Caoâs troops poured in from all sides: Xu Chu and Xu Huang
were in front and behind; Xiahou Yuan and Cao Hong to the left and right.
Meanwhile, the Xiliang soldiers fought with each other.
Losing sight of his generals, Ma Chao and one hundred riders got to the head of
the floating bridge over the River Wei just about dawn. There he fell across Li
Kan coming over the bridge with an army. Ma Chao set his spear and rode at him
full tilt. Li Kan turned down his spear and fled. From behind Ma Chao, Yu Jin
came up in pursuit. But unable to get near enough to seize Ma Chao, Yu Jin sent
an arrow flying after him. Ma Chaoâs ear caught the twang of the bowstring,
and he dodged the arrow, which flew on and killed Li Kan. Ma Chao turned to
attack his pursuer, who galloped away, and then he returned and took possession
of the bridge.
Quickly Cao Caoâs troops gathered about him, and the fiercest among them, the
Tiger Guard, shot arrows at Ma Chao, which he warded off with his spear shaft
so that they fell harmless to the earth. Ma Chao and his troops rode to and fro
striking a blow wherever there was a chance, but the enemy were very thick
about him, and he could not force his way out. In desperation he cut an alley
northwards and got through, but quite alone. Of his followers everyone fell.
Still he kept on dashing this way and that, till he was brought down by a
crossbow bolt. He lay upon the ground and his enemies were pressing in. But at
the critical moment, an army came in from the northwest and rescued him. Pang
De and Ma Dai had come up in the very nick of time.
Thus Ma Chao was rescued, and they set him on one of the soldiersâ horses,
and he again took up the battle. Leaving a trail of blood in his rear, he got
away northwest.
Hearing that his enemy had got away, Cao Cao gave order to his generals,
âPursue him day and night, and rich rewards are for him dead or alive. For
his head the rewards are a thousand ounces of gold and the lordship of a fief
of ten thousand families. If anyone captures Ma Chao, the reward is the rank of
general.â
Consequently the pursuit was hot as everyone was anxious to win renown and
reward. Meanwhile careless of all but flight, Ma Chao galloped on, and one by
one his followers dropped by the way. The footmen who were unable to keep up
were captured till very few remained, and only some scores of riders were left.
They traveled toward Lintao, a city in West Valley Land.
Cao Cao in person joined the pursuit and got to Anding, but there Ma Chao was
still far in advance, so he gave up and returned. Gradually the generals did
the same, all coming back to Changan. Poor Han Sui, with the loss of his left
hand, was an invalid, but he was rewarded with the Lordship of Xiliang. Yang
Qiu and Hou Xuan were given noble ranks and offices in Weikou.
Then orders were given to lead the whole army back to the capital. Yang Fu, a
military adviser from Liangzhou, came to Changan to point out the danger of
withdrawal.
âMa Chao has the boldness of Lu Bu and the heart of a barbarian. Unless you
destroy him this time, he will come again and he will be both bolder and
stronger, and the whole west will be lost. Wherefore you should not withdraw
your army.â
Cao Cao said, âI would be quite willing to finish the subjugation. But there
is much to do in the capital, and the south is still to conquer. So I cannot
remain. But you, Sir, might secure this region for me. Do you consent?â
Yang Fu did consent. And he brought to Cao Caoâs notice Wei Kang, who was
made Imperial Protector of Liangzhou, with joint military powers.
Just before Yang Fu left, he said to Cao Cao, âA strong force ought to be
left in Changan, as a reserve in case they be required.â
âThat has been already dealt with,â replied Cao Cao.
Contentedly enough Yang Fu took leave and went away.
Cao Caoâs generals asked him to explain his recent policy, saying, âSince
the first outbreak at Tong Pass, O Prime Minister, the north bank of River Wei
was undefended. Why did you not cross to the north bank from the east of the
Yellow River? But instead you engaged in the attack of the Pass for many days
before crossing to the north bank.â
And he replied, âThe rebels first held the Pass. Had I forthwith taken the
east side of the Yellow River, the rebels would have defended the camps one by
one and mustered at all the ferries, and I should never have got across to the
west side (which was also the north bank of River Wei). So I massed troops
against Tong Pass and made the rebels guard the south bank of River Wei, so
that the north bank was left open. Thus Xu Huang and Zhu Ling could move there,
and I was able later to cross over to join them. Then I made the raised road
and the mud rampart to deceive the enemy and cause them to think I was weak and
thus embolden them up to the point of attacking without proper preparation.
Then I used the clever device of causing dissension in their ranks and was able
in one day to destroy the stored up energy of all their forces. âIt was a
thunder clap before you could cover your ears.â Yes, indeed, the mutations of
the art of war can be called infinite.â
âBut one thing more puzzled us,â said the officers, âand we ask you to
explain it. When you heard the enemy was reinforced, you seemed to grow
happier. Why was that?â
âBecause Tong Pass is distant from Xuchang. If the rebels had taken advantage
of all defensible points and held them, they could not have been quelled in
less than a couple of years. When they came on altogether, they made a
multitude but they were not unanimous. They easily quarreled and, disunited,
were easily overcome. So I had reason to rejoice that they came on
altogether.â
âIndeed no one can equal you in strategy,â said his officers, bowing low
before him.
âStill, remember that I rely on you,â said Cao Cao.
Then he issued substantial rewards to the army and appointed Xiahou Yuan to the
command at Changan. The soldiers who had surrendered were distributed among the
various troops. Xiahou Yuan recommended Zhang Jia of Gaoling, as his aids.
So the army returned to Capital Xuchang where it was welcomed by the Emperor in
state chariot. As a reward for his service, Cao Cao was given the court
privileges of omitting his distinctive name when he was received in audience
and of proceeding toward the court without assuming the appearance of frantic
haste. Further he might go to court armed and booted, as did the Han Founding
Minister Xiao He of old. Whence his prestige and importance waxed mightily.
The fame of these doings penetrated west into Hanzhong, and one of the first to
be moved to indignation was Zhang Lu, Governor of Hanning. This Zhang Lu was a
native of Pei. He was a grandson of Zhang Ling who retired to Mount Humming, in
the East River Land, where he had composed a work on Daoism for the purpose of
deluding the multitude.
Yet all the people respected Zhang Ling, and when he died his son, Zhang Heng,
carried on his work, and taught the same doctrines. Disciples had to pay a fee
in rice, five carts. The people of his day called him the Rice Thief.
After Zhang Heng passed away, his son Zhang Lu followed his step. Zhang Lu
styled himself Master Superior, and his disciples were called Commonly Devil
Soldiers. A headman was called Libationer, and those who made many converts
were called Chief Libationers. Perfect sincerity was the ruling tenet of the
cult, and no deceit was permitted. When anyone fell ill, an altar was set up
and the invalid was taken into the Room of Silence where he could reflect upon
his sins and confess openly. Then he was prayed for. The director of prayers
was called Superintending Libationer.
When praying for a person, they wrote his name and his confession on a slip and
made three copies thereof, called âThe Writing of the Three Godsâ. One copy
was burned on the mountain top as a means of informing Heaven; another was
burned to inform Earth; and the third was sunk in water to tell the Controller
of the Waters. If the sick person recovered, he paid as fee five carts of rice.
They had Public Houses of Charity wherein the poor found rice and flesh and
means of cooking. Any wayfarer was allowed to take of these according to the
measure of his appetite. Those who took in excess would invite punishment from
on high. Offenses were pardoned thrice; afterwards offenders were punished.
They had no officials but all were subject to the control of the Libationers.
This sort of cult had been spreading in Hanzhong for some thirty years and had
escaped repression so far because of the remoteness of the region. All the
Government did was to give Zhang Lu the title of General Who Guards the South
and the post of Governor of Hanning and take means to secure from him a full
quota of local tribute.
When the reports of Cao Caoâs success against the west, and his prestige and
influence, reached the Hanzhong people, Zhang Lu met with his counselors to
discuss the matter.
Said Zhang Lu, âMa Teng has died, and Ma Chao defeated, thus the northwest
has fallen. Cao Caoâs next ambition will be the southwest, and Hanzhong will
be his first attack. I should act first by assuming the title of Prince of
Hanzhong and superintending the defense.â
In reply one Yan Pu said, âThe army of this region counts one hundred
thousand, and there are ample supplies of everything. East River Land is a
natural stronghold with its mountains and rivers. Now Ma Chaoâs soldiers are
newly defeated, and the fugitives from the Ziwu Valley are very numerous. We
can add them to our army by several ten-thousands more. My advice is that as
Liu Zhang of Yizhou is weak, we should take possession of the forty-one
counties of West River Land, and then you may set up your sovereign as soon as
you like.â
This speech greatly pleased Zhang Lu, who then began to concert measures with
his brother, Zhang Wei, to raise an army.
Stories of the movement reached Yizhou, whose Imperial Protector was Liu Zhang.
A son of Liu Yan, a descendant from Prince Gong of the Imperial House. Prince
Gong had been moved out to Jingling several generations ago, and the family had
settled there. Later, Liu Yan became Imperial Protector of Yizhou, and when he
died in due course in the first year of Prosperous Stability (AD 194), his son
was recommended for the vacant Protectorship.
There was enmity between Liu Zhang and Zhang Lu, for Liu Zhang had put to death
Zhang Luâs mother and brother. After that Liu Zhang dispatched Pang Xi as
Governor of Baxi to ward off Zhang Lu.
But Liu Zhang had always been feeble, and when he received news from his
commander of Zhang Luâs movements, his heart sank within him for fear, and he
hastily called in his advisers.
At the council one haughtily said, âMy Master, be not alarmed. I am no
genius, but I have a bit of a healthy tongue, and with that I will make Zhang
Lu afraid even to look this way.â
When plots did grow about the west,
It suited Jingzhouâs plans the best.
The speakerâs name and lineage will be told in the next chapter.


****** Romance of the Three Kingdoms ******
**** Chapter 60 ****
The man who proposed the plan spoken of in the last chapter was Zhang Song, who
belonged to Yizhou and held the small office of Supernumerary Charioteer. He
had a broad forehead, protuberant at the temples like a countrymanâs hoe, and
a pointed head. His nose was flat and his teeth protruded. He was a dwarf in
stature but had a deep voice like a great bell.
âWhat proposal have you to offer that may avert this danger?â asked the
Imperial Protector.
âMy proposal is that we gain the support of Cao Cao. As we know, he has made
a clean sweep of the empire. Lu Bu went first, and both the Yuans followed, all
exterminated. Lately he has destroyed Ma Chao. In short he is the one man
against whom no one can stand. Therefore, my lord, prepare me worthy gifts to
take to the capital, and I will get Cao Cao to march an army against Hanzhong,
which will keep this Zhang Lu occupied so that we shall be left alone.â
This met Liu Zhangâs views, and so he prepared gold and pearls and rich
stuffs, worthy presents for the man of power. And when these were ready, he
appointed Zhang Song his emissary. Zhang Song in the meantime occupied his
leisure in secretly copying maps and plans of the west country. When all was
ready, he started with a small escort.
They heard this in Jingzhou, and Zhuge Liang sent a trusty person to the
capital to keep him informed as to all the doings.
Zhang Song arrived in Xuchang, and, after he had established himself in his
lodging, he made daily visits to the Prime Ministerâs palace to try to obtain
an interview. But the last success over Ma Chao had filled Cao Cao with
insufferable pride, and he did nothing but give banquets. He never appeared
except for the most important affairs, and even carried on the business of the
state in his own residence. So Zhang Song waited many days. But when he got to
know the persons who were nearest the Prime Minister, he bribed them and
obtained an audience.
Cao Cao was seated in the high place, and after his visitor had finished
salutations, he said, âYour master Liu Zhang has sent no tribute for several
years. Why?â
âBecause the roads are dangerous, and thieves and robbers infest them.
Intercourse is restricted.â
Cao Cao interrupted in a loud harsh voice, saying, âWhat thieves and robbers
are there when I have cleansed the empire?â
âHow can you say the land is tranquil when one sees Sun Quan in the south,
Zhang Lu and Liu Bei in the west, and everyone of these with armies reckoned in
legions? The weakest of them has one hundred thousand troops.â
The extraordinary appearance of the emissary had prejudiced Cao Cao from the
outset; and when Cao Cao heard these blunt words, he suddenly shook out his
sleeves, rose and left the hall.
Those in attendance were annoyed with Zhang Song and said, âHow can you
behave so rudely when you come on a mission? Your whole attitude was blunt and
discourteous. Happily for you, our lord remembered you had come from afar and
did not take open notice of your fault. The best thing for you is to go home
again as quickly as you can.â
But Zhang Song smiled.
âWe have no plausible flatterers and glib talkers in the River Lands,â said
he.
At this, one from below the steps called out, âSo you call us plausible and
glib then. And you have none such in your country, eh?â
Zhang Song looked around and saw the speaker was a man with thin delicate
eyebrows crossing narrow eyes set in a pale spiritual face. He asked his name.
It was Yang Xiu, son of the former Imperial Guardian Yang Biao. The young man
was then employed as Chair of the Secretariat of the Prime Ministerâs palace.
He was deeply read and had the reputation of being a clever controversialist,
as Zhang Song knew. So on one side was a desire to confound and on the other
overweening pride in his own ability, with contempt for other scholars.
Perceiving the ridicule in Zhang Songâs speech, Yang Xiu invited him to go to
the library where they could talk more freely. There, after they had got
settled in their respective places, Yang Xiu began to talk about the west.
âYour roads are precipitous and wearisome,â said Yang Xiu.
âBut at our lordâs command we travel, even through fire and water. We never
decline,â replied Zhang Song.
âWhat sort of a country is this Yizhou?â
âYizhou is a name for the group of western counties and territories known of
old as the state of Shu. The roads are intersected by streams, and the land
bristles with steep mountains. The circuit is over two hundred stations and
marches and the area over one hundred thousand square miles. The population is
dense, villages being so close that the crowings of cocks in one waken the
people in the next, and the dogs barking in this excite the curs in that. The
soil is rich and well cultivated, and droughts or famines are equally unknown.
Prosperity is general, and the music of pipes and strings can always be heard.
The produce of the fields is piled mountain high. There is no place its
equal.â
âBut what of the people?â
âOur administrators are talented as Lin Xiangru; our soldiers able as Ma
Yuan; our physicians are expert as Zhang Ji; our diviners are profound as Yan
Zun. Our schools of philosophy and our culture stand forth as models, and we
have more remarkable people than I can enumerate. How should I ever finish the
tale of them?â
âAnd how many such as you, Sir, do you think there are at the orders of your
Imperial Protector?â
âOur officers are all geniuses: Wise, bold, loyal, righteous, and
magnanimous. As for poor simpletons like me: They are counted by hundreds;
there are cartloads of them, bushels of them. No one could count them.â
âWhat office may you hold then?â
Zhang Song replied, âMine can hardly be called an office. I am a
Supernumerary Charioteer. But, Sir, what state affairs may you control?â
âI am the First Secretary in the Palace of the Prime Minister,â replied
Yang Xiu.
âThey say that members of your family held office for many generations, and I
do not understand why you are not in court service actually assisting the
Emperor, instead of filling the post of a mere clerk in the private palace of
the Prime Minister.â
Yang Xiuâs face suffused with shame at this rebuke, but he mastered himself
and replied, âThough I am among the minor officials, yet my duties are of
great importance, and I am gaining experience under the Prime Ministerâs
guidance. I hold the office for the sake of the training.â
Zhang Song smiled, saying, âIf what I have heard is true, Cao Caoâs
learning throws no gleaming light on the way of Confucius or Mencius, nor does
his military skill illumine the art of Sun Zi or Wu Qi. He seems to understand
the doctrine of brute force and holding on to what advantages he can seize, but
I see not how he can give you any valuable training or enlighten your
understanding.â
âAh, Sir, that comes of dwelling in out-of-the-way parts. How could you know
of the magnificent talents of the great Prime Minister? But I will show you
something.â
Yang Xiu called up an attendant and bade him bring a book from a certain case.
He showed this to his guest, who read the title âThe New Book of Cao Caoâ.
Then Zhang Song opened it and read it through from the beginning, the whole
thirteen chapters. They all dealt with the art of war.
âWhat do you take this to be?â asked Zhang Song, when he had finished.
âThis is the great Prime Ministerâs discussion of the art of ancient and
modern war composed on the model of Sun Ziâs Treatise on the Art of War. You
may be disdainful of the Prime Ministerâs talents, but will this not go down
to posterity?â
âThis book! Every child in Yizhou knows this by heart. What do you mean by
calling it a new book? It was written by some obscure person of the time of the
Warring States, and Cao Cao has plagiarized it. But he has deceived no one but
you, Sir.â
âBut what is the use of your sarcastic insult in saying that your school
children know the book by rote? It has never been given to the world, although
copies have been made. It belongs to his private library.â
âDo you disbelieve me? Why, I know it and could repeat it.â
Then Zhang Song repeated the whole book, word for word, from beginning to end.
Yang Xiu said, âYou remember it like this after only one reading! Really you
are marvelous.â
He boasted not a handsome face,
Nor was his body blessed with grace.
His words streamed like a waterfall,
He read a book and knew it all.
Shuâs glories could he well rehearse,
His lore embraced the universe.
Or text or note of scholiast
Once read, his memory held fast.
At leave-taking Yang Xiu said, âRemain a while in your lodgings till I can
petition our Prime Minister to give you another interview.â
Zhang Song thanked him and left.
By and bye Yang Xiu went to see Cao Cao on the matter of receiving the emissary
from the west and said, âSir, why did you formerly treat Zhang Song so off-
hand?â
âHe spoke very rudely. That is why.â
âBut you bore with Mi Heng. Why not with this man?â
âMi Hengâs reputation for scholarship stood highest of all, and I could not
bear to put him to death. But what ability has this Zhang Song?â
âTo say nothing about his speech being like the River of Heaven, nothing
daunts his talent for dialectic. I happened to show him your new treatise; he
read it over once and could repeat it. From this, it is evident he is cultured
and has a prodigious memory. There are few like him in the world. But he said
the book was the work of an obscure person of a few hundred years back, and
every school child in his country knew it.â
âIt only shows that the ancients and I are in secret sympathy,â replied Cao
Cao.
However, Cao Cao ordered the book to be torn up and burned.
âThen may I bring him to see you, Sir, that he may see the glory of our
court.â
Cao Cao grudgingly consented, saying âI am reviewing troops tomorrow on the
western parade ground. You may bring him there and let him see what my army
looks like. He will be able to talk about it when he goes home. When I have
dealt with the south, I shall take the west in hand.â
Hence the very next day Yang Xiu took Zhang Song over to the west parade
ground, where a review of the Tiger Guard was to be held. There were fifty
thousand of them, and when drawn up in order, they made a very brave show with
their gleaming helmets and bright new uniforms. Their drums rolled to shake the
heavens, and their weapons glittered in the sun. Their discipline and order
were perfect. Their gay banners fluttered in the breeze. They looked ready to
fly even, so alert and smart were they.
Zhang Song glanced at them contemptuously.
After a long time Cao Cao called up Zhang Song and, pointing to his army, said,
âHave you ever seen such fine bold fellows in Yizhou?â
âWe never see this military parade in Yizhou. We govern the people by
righteousness.â
Cao Cao changed color and looked hard at the bold speaker, who gazed back at
him without the least sign of fear.
Yang Xiu shot a quick glance at Zhang Song, but Cao Cao went on, saying, âI
regard the rat-class of the world as of no more importance than so many weeds,
and for my army to reach a place is to overcome it, to give battle is to
conquer, to besiege is to take. Those who are with me, live; but those who
oppose me, die. Do you understand?â
âO Prime Minister, I know well that when you march out your army, you always
conquer. I knew it when you attacked Lu Bu at Puyang; and when you fought Zhang
Xiu at Wancheng; and when you met Zhou Yu at the Red Cliffs; and when in
Huarong Valley you encountered Guan Yu; and on that day when you cut off your
beard and threw away your robe at Tong Pass; and when you hid in a boat to
escape the arrows on the Yellow River. On all these occasions, no one could
stand against you.â
It made Cao Cao very angry to be thus twitted with his misfortunes and he said,
âYou stuck-up pedant! How dare you thus bring up all my failures?â
Cao Cao called to his attendants to eject the bold disputant and put him to
death.
Yang Xiu ventured to argue with him, saying, âYou may behead him, but he came
from the west bearing tribute, and his death would have a very evil effect on
all distant peoples.â
But Cao Cao was too angry to be reasonable and persisted. However, Xun Yu also
remonstrated, and Zhang Song was not put to death. But he was beaten and
ejected. He returned to his lodging and left the city that night, reflecting
upon what he had intended and what he had accomplished.
Thought he, âI did not expect such arrogance when I came with the intention
of giving him a region. When I get back, Liu Zhang will expect great things.
Now I am returning empty handed and a failure to endure the laughter of my
fellow country people. I will not go back. I have heard of the virtues of Liu
Bei, and I will go to him and see what manner of man he is. Then I can decide
what to do.â
So with his little escort and following he made for Jingzhou. He had reached
the boundaries of Wuchang when he met a body of horsemen, at the head of whom
rode a general in simple dress.
The general pulled up, saying, âSurely you are the Charioteer Zhang Song.â
âI am he,â said Zhang Song.
The general quickly dismounted and humbly said, âI have expected you these
many days. I am Zhao Zilong.â
Zhang Song dismounted and returned the salutation, saying, âThen you are no
other than the Fine Man of Changshan.â
âNo other,â was the reply. âAnd my lord Liu Bei bade me await you here
and offer you refreshment after your long and toilsome journey.â
At this some soldiers brought forward wine and food which they offered
kneeling.
Zhang Song said, âI am come because the world says Liu Bei is liberal and
kindly disposed.â
After a few cups of wine, the two retook the road toward Jingzhou City, which
they neared next day at evening. They went to the guest-house. Here they found
a large number of people who received the visitor with the beating of drums and
every sign of respect.
And the officer in command, bowing low, said, âMy brother sent me to meet you
after your long and dusty journey and prepare the guest-house for your
reception. My name is Guan Yu.â
So Zhang Song and Zhao Zilong dismounted and entered the guest-house, where
hosts and guest exchanged formal salutations and took their seats. In a short
time refreshments were served, and both men were most diligent in their
attention to the traveler. This roadside banquet was prolonged to the time of
setting the watch, when they prepared for rest.
Next morning, after the early meal, they mounted and continued their journey.
Very soon they met Liu Bei himself, with an escort, and his two chief advisers,
deferentially standing by the roadside.
As soon as he recognized them, Zhang Song dismounted and walked toward them.
Liu Bei received him with extreme respect.
âYour exalted name has been long known to me,â said Liu Bei. âAnd it has
reverberated through my ears. My one regret is that cloudy hills and long
distances have hitherto prevented me from enjoying the advantage of your
instruction. Hearing that you were passing through, I have come to meet you.
And if you would be willing to notice me and condescend to rest for a time in
my city, thus allowing me to satisfy my long disappointed desire to see you, I
should indeed hold myself fortunate.â
Naturally the travelerâs vanity was tickled, and he joyfully remounted. They
rode bridle to bridle into the city. When they reached the residence, again
they exchanged profound salutations and compliments before they took their
various places as host and guest. And then a banquet was served. But all
throughout Liu Bei refrained from saying a word about the west. He only chatted
on general and common things.
The visitor noted this steady avoidance and resolved to probe his hostâs
thoughts.
âHow many counties are there in Jingzhou, where you are now, O Imperial
Uncle?â
Zhuge Liang replied, âJingzhou is only ours temporarily. We have borrowed it
from the South Land. They are always sending messengers to demand its return.
However, now that our lord has married their daughter, his position is more
secure. But it is still temporary.â
âThe South Land is large,â said Zhang Song, âyet their six territories
and their eighty-one counties do not satisfy them. The people are strong and
the land is fruitful.â
Said Pang Tong, âOur lord, being of the dynastic family, has never occupied a
territory of the empire. Those others, rebellious as they are, may indeed seize
upon as much territory as they are strong enough to hold. People of reasons do
not approve such wrongs . . . â
âNoble Sirs, pray say no more. What virtue have I that I should expect
anything from the future?â said Liu Bei.
âNot so, indeed,â said Zhang Song. âIllustrious Sir, you are of the
lineage of Han. Your noble character is widely known. No one could say that
your fate excludes all thoughts of occupying territory, where you might begin
to set up authority and take an emperorâs position!â
Liu Bei deprecated such a suggestion, âSir, you go too far. This really is
too much!â
The next three days were spent in banquets and wine parties, but all the time
no mention was made of West River Land. And when, at the end of that time,
Zhang Song took leave, his host was at the three-mile âparting roadâ to bid
him farewell and offer refreshment.
When the moment came for the parting, Liu Bei raised his wine-cup and said,
âI am sincerely grateful that you deigned to come here. You have prolonged
your visit to three days, but now the moment of parting has come. Who knows
when I may have the privilege of receiving your instructions again?â
As Liu Bei said this, the tears flowed, but he hid them while Zhang Song,
willing to believe that this emotion was on his account, thought how
wonderfully kind and noble his host must be to be thus affected. Quite
overcome, Zhang Song decided to speak about the west.
So he said, âI have thought that I, too, would come to you one day, but so
far I have found no way. In Jingzhou I see Sun Quan on the east, always ready
to pounce; I see Cao Cao on the north, greedy to swallow. So this is not a
wholly desirable place for you to remain in.â
âI know this but too well,â said Liu Bei, âbut I have no secure place to
go to.â
âYizhou is well protected, has much fertile soil, is populous and well
governed. Its scholars are attracted by your virtue. If you marched your armies
westward, you could easily become a real power there and restore the glory of
the Hans.â
âBut how dare I attempt this? The ruler is also of the Imperial House. The
whole region is devoted to him for his good deeds, and no other person could
attain such a hold.â
âI am no traitor,â said Zhang Song, âbut in your presence I feel
constrained to be perfectly open and plain. Liu Zhang, the Imperial Protector
of Yizhou, is naturally weak and can neither use the wise nor employ the
capable. Then again Zhang Lu threatens on the north. People are distracted and
would gladly welcome an appreciative ruler. The journey I have just made was to
propose to support Cao Cao and place the region under him, but I found him
rebellious and set on evil, proud and arrogant. So I have turned aside to you.
If you will take Yizhou, you will have a base from which to deal with Hanzhong
when you will, and the whole empire beside. You will continue the rightful
line, and your name will live in history. Would not that be real fame? If then
you think of taking our region, I am willing to do what little I can as an ally
within. But do you contemplate such a step?â
âI am deeply grateful that you think so well of me. But the Imperial
Protector being a member of the family, I should lay myself open to general
execration, were I to attack him.â
âWhen a hero finds himself in the world, his duty is to work out his destiny,
to exert himself and perform his task as best as he can, to press forward among
the foremost. At the moment the position is that, if you fail to seize this
opportunity, some other will take possession of Yizhou, and you will regret
when too late.â
âAnd I have heard much of the difficult nature of the country, its many high
mountains and numerous streams, and its narrow roads. How could such a country
be invaded?â
Then Zhang Song drew the map from his sleeve, saying, âI am so deeply
affected by your virtue that I offer you this map of the country, whereby its
roads and rivers may be known.â
Liu Bei unrolled the map. It was covered with notes, on the lie of the land,
lengths and widths, and such matters. Strategic points on rivers and hills were
shown, and store-houses and granaries and treasuries. Everything was plainly
stated.
Zhang Song went on, âSir, you can prepare your plans promptly. I have two
friends who will certainly help you. And when they come to see you, you may be
perfectly frank with them. Their names are Fa Zheng and Meng Da.â
Liu Bei thanked him with joined hands.
Said Liu Bei, âAs the blue mountains grow not old and the green waters always
remain, so shall I never forget. And when I shall have accomplished my task,
you shall have no mean reward.â
Replied Zhang Song, âI look for no reward. Having met with an enlightened
lord, I felt compelled to unbosom myself to him.â
Zhang Song left soon after, and Guan Yu escorted him for several miles.
After arrival in Yizhou, Zhang Song lost no time in visiting his close friend
Fa Zheng, who was from Fufeng. Fa Zheng was told of Cao Caoâs arrogance and
haughtiness toward scholars and good people.
âAs for the man himself,â said Zhang Song, âhe is a man to grieve with
but not a person to rejoice with. I have promised Yizhou to Liu Bei, the
Imperial Uncle, and I want your especial advice and assistance.â
âI think Liu Zhang is incapable,â said Fa Zheng, âand I have felt drawn
to Liu Bei for some time past. So we are in sympathy here.â
Shortly after Meng Da arrived. Meng Da and Fa Zheng were fellow townsmen. When
Meng Da entered the room, he saw the other two in earnest and secret
conversation.
And he said, âI know what you two are about. You are scheming to hand over
Yizhou to somebody.â
âIt is really so. You have guessed right,â said Zhang Song.
âBut to whom ought it to go?â said Fa Zheng.
âThere is but one: Liu Bei,â said Meng Da.
All three clapped their hands and laughed.
Then said Fa Zheng to Zhang Song, âYou will see our lord tomorrow. What about
that?â
âI shall recommend that you two be sent to Jingzhou on a mission.â
They thought that a suitable scheme.
And when the lately arrived messenger saw his master and was asked how he had
fared, Zhang Song said, âCao Cao is a rebel who desires to get the whole
empire into his hands. I need hardly tell you that. But he also hankers after
this region.â
âThen what will become of us?â said Liu Zhang.
âI have a plan to check both our enemies. Liu Bei, the Imperial Uncle, now in
Jingzhou, is a relative of yours, and he is generous and well disposed. This is
a matter of common knowledge. Cao Cao was simply overwhelmed at the result of
the battle at the Red Cliffs, and Zhang Lu more so. Now my plan is that you
ally yourself with your distinguished relative against Cao Cao and Zhang Lu.â
âI have been thinking thus for a long time. Can you recommend a suitable
emissary?â
âThe only ones are Fa Zheng and Meng Da.â
These two were summoned and, meanwhile, a letter was prepared. Fa Zheng was to
proceed as emissary to open up friendly relations, and Meng Da would follow in
due course with an army to welcome Liu Bei into the West River Land.
While still discussing the details of the policy, a person forced his way in,
his face all running with sweat, and cried out, âMy lord, your land of forty-
one counties will be lost to you and pass to another if you listen to Zhang
Song!â
Zhang Song turned a startled look on the intruder, who was Huang Quan of
Xiliang, First Secretary in the Imperial Protectorâs palace.
The Imperial Protector said, âWhy do you use such language? Liu Bei is of my
family, and so I am seeking his support.â
Said Huang Quan, âI know all about him. He is liberal minded to gain people
to his side, and his softness can overcome the hardest. He is bolder than any
other. He gains humansâ hearts from afar off, and those near him look up to
him. He also has the wisest advisers in Zhuge Liang and Pang Tong, and the
boldest warriors such as Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Zilong, Huang Zhong, and Wei
Yan. But if you call him here as a soldier, think you that he will be content
to remain in a lowly condition? And if you treat him as an honored guest, can a
state stand two rulers? Hear me, my lord, and you stand secure as Taishan
Mountains; be deaf to my words, and your position is as precarious as a pile of
eggs. This Zhang Song has lately come home through Jingzhou, where he has
certainly been plotting with Liu Bei. Slay this man; and make an end of Liu
Bei. That will be for the happiness of this land.â
âBut how else am I to fend off my two enemies?â
âFortify your country, dig out your moats, and raise your ramparts. Then you
can wait on events.â
âIf these rebels invade this land, the position will be critical, as when
fire singes oneâs eyebrows. It is idle talk to tell me to wait on events.â
No notice was taken of Huang Quan, and Fa Zheng was about to set out when
another interfered, crying, âNo, no!â
This was a secretary, Wang Lei.
With bowed head Wang Lei stood and said, âMy lord will bring misfortune upon
himself if he listens to this Zhang Song.â
âNot so; I make an alliance with Liu Bei in order to withstand Zhang Lu.â
âZhang Luâs invasion would be but a skin disease. Liu Beiâs entry into
this country would be a mortal malady. Liu Bei is an unscrupulous brave. He was
once in Cao Caoâs service and plotted against him. Then he hung on to Sun
Quan and seized Jingzhou. This shows his character and his designs. Think you
that you two can dwell together? If you invite him, then Shu is lost!â
âNo more wild talk!â cried Liu Zhang angrily. âLiu Bei is of my clan and
family and will not ravish me of my possessions.â
He bade the guards escort both men outside and ordered Fa Zheng to set out. So
he did, and before long came to Jingzhou. When the salutations were over, Fa
Zheng presented his letter, which Liu Bei opened and read:
âI, Liu Zhang, a younger brother of our family, now write to General Liu Bei.
From my humble place long have I gazed in your direction, but the roads of the
West River Land are precipitous, and I have failed to send my tribute. This is
to my shame. The victims of misfortune aid each other, and those in trouble
support each other. If friends act thus, how much more should members of the
same family? Now Zhang Lu is mustering an army of invasion on my northern
frontier, much to the injury of my tranquillity. Wherefore I send this letter
that you may know of my distress. And if you remember the kindly bonds of
family and will play a brotherly part and lead your armies to destroy these
ruffians, you will be my eternal protector and I shall be ever grateful. This
letter leaves much unsaid, but I await your coming.â
This letter greatly pleased Liu Bei. He made a banquet for the bearer thereof,
and when they had mellowed themselves with wine, he dismissed the attendants
and spoke to Fa Zheng in confidence.
âFriend, I have long admired you, and Zhang Song extolled your virtues. I
shall always feel grateful for this opportunity of hearing you.â
Fa Zheng bowed, saying, âThat is too great praise for a humble emissary from
Shu. But they say that horses always neighed in recognition of Bo Le, the
supreme judge of horses, and when a person has found his lord, he dies for him.
Have you thought further of Zhang Songâs proposals, General?â
âI have always been a wanderer, often in suffering and sorrow. I have often
thought of the wren for even that tiny bird has a twig to rest on; and of the
cunning hare, that secures safety with three openings to its burrow. Does not a
person need at least a shelter? Your land of the west is fertile and a
temptation, but its ruler is of my family, and I cannot plot against him.â
âYes. Yizhou is a very paradise. But without a ruler it cannot exist. Liu
Zhang knows not how to use the wise people, and his heritage must speedily pass
to another. Today it is offered to your hands, and you must not miss the
opportunity. You know the saying, that the leader in the hunt gets the quarry.
If you will only consent, I will serve you to the death.â
Liu Bei signified his gratitude. Said he, âLet me reflect for a time and take
advice.â
The banquet terminated and the guest left. Zhuge Liang conducted Fa Zheng to
his lodging while his master sat thinking.
Then Pang Tong said, âYou must decide â-not to decide is foolish. You are
of high intelligence, my lord, and why do you hesitate?â
âWhat should my reply be?â asked Liu Bei.
âYou know these surroundings â-Sun Quan in the east and Cao Cao in the
north â-, and with them you cannot attain your ends. Now before you lies a
populous, fertile, and rich land, a base with the greatest possibilities. You
have the promise of assistance from two men within, and it seems like a gift of
providence. Why hesitate?â
âNow there are two men in the world as mutually antagonistic as fire and
water. My opposite is Cao Cao. He is impetuous and I am long suffering; he is
cruel and I am humane; he feigns while I am true. In all particulars I act the
direct contrary to him. I refuse to risk the loss of the confidence and trust
of the world for a trifling advantage.â
Pang Tong smiled at these sentiments, saying, âMy lordâs words are quite in
accord with abstract rectitude, but such ideas scarcely suit the days of
rebellion. There are other ways of fighting than with warlike weapons, but to
adhere too obstinately to the idea of abstract rectitude is to do nothing. One
must be an opportunist, annex the weak and attack the willfully deluded, seize
the recalcitrant and protect the docile. These were the teachings of the great
Kings Tang and Wu. If after the settlement you reward with righteousness and
make of the land a great country, will you be guilty of a breach of trust?
Remember if you do not take it now, another will.â
Liu Bei, realizing the truth in what Pang Tong said, replied, âThese words
are as jewels. They should be engraved on my very heart.â
Thereupon he summoned Zhuge Liang to settle the details of an army to march
west.
Zhuge Liang said, âThis is an important place and must be very well
defended.â
Liu Bei replied, âI, Pang Tong, and my two generals Huang Zhong and Wei Yan
will go into the west. You and our three best generals â-Guan Yu, Zhang Fei,
and Zhao Zilong â-can defend Jingzhou.â
Guan Yu was told off to hold Xiangyang and the narrow pass at Qingni, Zhang Fei
commanded four territories along the river, and Zhao Zilong camped at
Jiangling.
For the march westward, Huang Zhong led the van, Wei Yan had the rearguard,
while Liu Bei moved in the center with Liu Feng and Guan Ping as his aids. Pang
Tong was Commander of the whole army.
Just as the fifty thousand troops were starting, there came Liao Hua to offer
his service. He and his troops were attached to Guan Yu.
It was in the winter that the expedition started. Soon they met the force under
Meng Da, five thousand soldiers, to act as escort into Yizhou. Liu Bei informed
Liu Zhang that he had started, and the latter sent orders to the counties along
the road to entertain them well on the march.
The Imperial Protector proposed to go out in person to welcome Liu Bei and
ordered carriages to be prepared and tents and banners. All the escort were
dressed in glittering armor. At this Secretary Huang Quan, the sturdy opponent
of the invitation to Liu Bei, again remonstrated.
âMy lord, if you go out, you will be exposed to danger. I have been in your
service for many years, and I would prevent you from being the victim of
anotherâs wiles. I pray you reflect.â
Zhang Song said, âHis words are those of one who would sow discord in a
family and encourage the power of the robbers who threaten you. Assuredly such
action is to your detriment.â
Liu Zhang then spoke angrily to Huang Quan, saying, âI have decided, and why
do you oppose me?â
The objector bowed his head and wept. Then approaching nearer, he seized hold
of the Imperial Protectorâs robe with his teeth to hinder him. Liu Zhang
angrily shook his robe and rose from his seat, but Huang Quan still held on
till two of his teeth fell out. Then the guards forced him away, and he
retired, still crying.
As Liu Zhang was starting, another man cried, âMy lord, do you neglect the
loyal words of your faithful Huang Quan to go to your death?â
And he threw himself prostrate at the steps in remonstrance. He was Li Hui of
Jianning.
âThe prince may have ministers who remonstrate with him, and the father may
have children who oppose,â said Li Hui. âHuang Quan has spoken faithfully,
and you ought to listen. To let Liu Bei into this land is to welcome the tiger
into your gates.â
âLiu Bei is my brother and will not harm me,â said the Imperial Protector.
âAnd any other who shall oppose me shall suffer death.â
So Li Hui was thrust out.
âThe officers of Shu regard the safety of their families and no longer render
you service. The generals are arrogant, and each has some scheme of his own to
further. If you do not get Liu Bei to oppose the enemy without and your own
people oppose you within, surely you are on the road to ruin.â
So spoke Zhang Song, and the Imperial Protector replied, âI know the plan is
for my advantage.â
Whereupon he mounted his horse to ride out to Elm Tree Bridge.
Then a messenger reported to him: âWang Lei has suspended himself, head
downwards, at the city gate. In one hand he holds a written remonstrance and in
the other a knife. And he says that if you heed him not, he will cut the rope
and die at your feet.â
Liu Zhang went to the gate, took the writing and read:
âGood medicine is bitter in the mouth but good for the disease; faithful
words offend the ear but are good for the conduct. Of old King Huai of Chu
listened not to Qu Yuan, but attended the meeting at Wu Pass and was captured
by the state of Qin. Sir, you are thoughtlessly leaving your place to go to
welcome Liu Bei, but I fear there is a way out and none in. Could you but
behead Zhang Song in the market place and have nothing to do with this league
with Liu Bei, it would be for the happiness of old and young, and assure the
safety of yourself.â
Anger rose in Liu Zhangâs breast as he read.
âWhy do you insult me when I go to meet a kindly man I feel as if I were
about to enjoy the delight of seeing brother?â
At this Wang Lei gave a great cry, severed the rope, and fell to the ground
battered and dead.
Head downwards at the city gate one hung
A last remonstrance in his outstretched hand.
Resolved that, were his words rejected, he
Would not survive defeat. Sincere was he
Who, desperate, held to Liu Zhangâs silken robe
Until his broken teeth released their grip.
Sincere indeed, but how can he compare
With stern Wang Lei who went to awful death?
Liu Zhang with thirty thousand troops went out to welcome his clansman, and
there followed one thousand wagons laden with supplies and rich stuffs.
Liu Beiâs advanced guard had arrived at River Dian. During the march the
people had brought presents, and Liu Bei had given an order to pay for
everything, under penalty of death for disobedience. Thus no one suffered, and
the people came out in trusting crowds to watch the soldiers marching by and
welcome them in every way. Liu Bei soothed them with very gracious words.
Then Fa Zheng secretly showed Pang Tong a letter from Zhang Song advocating the
assassination of Liu Zhang near the place of welcome.
Pang Tong said, âSay nothing about this. After the two Lius have met, there
may be opportunities, but this is too early to talk. Any plot would leak
out.â
So nothing was said.
Fucheng, where the meeting was to take place, was one hundred twenty miles from
Capital Chengdu. Liu Zhang arrived first and sent messengers to welcome Liu
Bei. The two armies camped on the bank of River Fu. Liu Bei went into the city
to see the Imperial Protector, and they met cordially as brothers should. Both
shed a few tears, and by and bye they began a heart-to-heart talk. Then
followed a banquet, and after this each returned to his own camp.
The Imperial Protector said, âHow ridiculous have been proved the fears of
Huang Quan and Wang Lei! They do not understand the force of family affection.
I see he is really a kindly and noble man, and with him as a support I shall
fear neither Cao Cao nor Zhang Lu. And I owe all this to Zhang Song.â
To show his gratitude, Liu Zhang took off the green silken robe he wore and
sent it as a gift to Zhang Song, together with five hundred ounces of gold.
However, some of his officers were not so content, and a group of them bade him
beware.
âDo not rejoice too soon, O Master,â said they, âfor Liu Bei is hard
enough within in spite of his mild exterior. You have not sounded him yet and
should be on your guard.â
âYou are all too anxious,â said Liu Zhang, laughing. âMy brother is no
double-dealer, I am sure.â
When Liu Bei had returned to his own tent, Pang Tong came in to ask what
impression he had of his host of that day.
âHe seems a very honest man,â said Liu Bei.
âHe is good enough, but some of his servants are discontented at this turn of
affairs, and I would not guarantee there will be no murders. If you took my
advice, you would have Liu Zhang assassinated at the return banquet. A hundred
ruffians behind the arras, a signal from you, and the deed would be
accomplished. All that would be needed, then would be a rush on Capital
Chengdu. No sword need be drawn, no arrow fitted to the string.â
âHe is a brother of my house and has treated me with sincerity. I am a new-
comer and so far unknown in this land. Such a deed would be abhorrent to all
the world, and these people would resent it. I will not establish myself by
such means.â
âThe scheme is not mine. It originated in a private letter from Zhang Song,
who says it will have to be done some time.â
At this moment Fa Zheng came in and said, âThis is not for ourselves. It is
the will of heaven.â
âLiu Zhang and I are of the same house, and I would shudder at harming
him,â said Liu Bei.
âSir, you are wrong. If you act not as we propose, then Zhang Lu will take
Shu in revenge for the death of his mother. What is there for you at the end of
your long march? Advance, and success is yours; retreat, and you have nothing.
And delays are most dangerous. At any moment this scheme may leak out, and
another will reap the profit. This is the day when Heaven smiles on you. Act
before Liu Zhang suspects you. Establish yourself.â
So urged Fa Zheng, and Pang Tong backed it.
Their lord, by argument, they tried
From rectitude to turn aside.
What Liu Bei hid in his heart will be explained in the next chapter.
